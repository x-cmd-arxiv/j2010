The sum rule follows directly from a relation between quark and squark\ncouplings to the Higgs, enforced by SUSY. It is exactly this relation that\nensures the cancellation of the one-loop quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass\nfrom the top sector. Testing the sum rule experimentally would thus provide a\npowerful consistency check on SUSY as the solution to the gauge hierarchy\nproblem.

Fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions are\nmodelled as in our previous work [M. Greschek et al., Soft Matter, 2010,\nDOI:10.1039/B924417D). We study several anchoring mechanisms at the solid\nsubstrate by introducing an anchoring function (0<g(u)<1) that depends on the\norientation of a fluid molecule relative to the substrate plane; g(u)\n\"switches\" the fluid-substrate attraction on or off. Here we focus on various\nheterogeneous (i.e., hybrid) anchoring scenarios imposing different anchoring\nfunctions at the opposite substrates. As in our previous study we compute the\nisostress heat capacity which allows us to identify states at which the\nconfined fluid undergoes a structural transformation. The isotropic-nematic\ntransformation turns out to be nearly independent of the specific anchoring\nscenario. This is because the director in the nematic phase assumes a direction\nthat is a compromise between the directions enforced by the competing anchoring\nscenarios at either substrate. On the contrary, at lower compressional stresses\nmolecules prealign in specific directions that depend on details of the\nanchoring scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 17:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

One important parameter\nrequired in the determination of the mass of the compact objects in these\nsystems is the binary inclination. We can determine the inclination by modeling\nthe ellipsoidal modulations of the Roche-lobe filling donor star, but the\ncontamination of the donor star light from other components of the binary,\nparticularly the accretion disk, must be taken into account. To this end, we\ndetermined the donor star contribution to the infrared flux by comparing the\nspectra of V404 Cyg and Cen X-4 to those of various field K-stars of known\nspectral type. For V404 Cyg, we determined that the donor star has a spectral\ntype of K3 III. We determined the fractional donor contribution to the NIR flux\nin the H- and K-bands as $0.98 \\pm .05$ and $0.97 \\pm .09$, respectively. We\nremodeled the H-band light curve from \\citet{sanwal1996} after correcting for\nthe donor star contribution to obtain a new value for the binary inclination.\nFrom this, we determined the mass of the black hole in V404 Cyg to be $M_{BH}=\n9.0^{+.2}_{-.6}M_{\\odot}$. We performed the same spectral analysis for Cen X-4\nand found the spectral type of the donor star to be in the range K5 -- M1V.

We\nremodeled the H-band light curve from \\citet{shahbaz1993}, again correcting for\nthe fractional contribution of the donor star to obtain the inclination. From\nthis, we determined the mass of the neutron star as $M_{NS}=\n1.5^{+.1}_{-.4}M_{\\odot}$. However, the masses obtained for both systems should\nbe viewed with some caution since contemporaneous light curve and spectral data\nare required to obtain definitive masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 18:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A promising way to accelerate\nsimilarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a\nlarge number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to\nsimilar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently\nproposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known\nin advance, obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a\nvery challenging problem. In this paper, we emphasise this issue and propose a\nnovel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing: we first find the\noptimal $l$-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via\nunsupervised learning, and then train $l$ classifiers via supervised learning\nto predict the $l$-bit code for any query document unseen before. Our\nexperiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach\nusing binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 19:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

We find that the L_X-L_K relationship is steeper for\nfield galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. The low hot\ngas content of field galaxies with L_K < L_star suggests that internal\nprocesses such as supernovae driven winds or AGN feedback expel hot gas from\nlow mass galaxies. Such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusters\nwhere the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confine\noutflowing material. In addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be able\nto accrete gas from the ambient medium. While there is a population of L_K <\nL_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain hot gas halos, some galaxies\nin these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid of\nhot gas. In these cases, the hot gas halos have likely been removed via ram\npressure stripping.

In this paper we extend this study with the goal of finding the\noptimal mass-dependent halo weighting and use $N$-body simulations to perform a\ngeneral analysis of halo stochasticity and its dependence on halo mass. We\ninvestigate the stochasticity matrix, defined as $C_{ij}\\equiv<(\\delta_i\n-b_i\\delta_m)(\\delta_j-b_j\\delta_m)>$, where $\\delta_m$ is the dark matter\noverdensity in Fourier space, $\\delta_i$ the halo overdensity of the $i$-th\nhalo mass bin and $b_i$ the halo bias. In contrast to the Poisson model\npredictions we detect nonvanishing correlations between different mass bins. We\nalso find the diagonal terms to be sub-Poissonian for the highest-mass halos.\nThe diagonalization of this matrix results in one large and one low eigenvalue,\nwith the remaining eigenvalues close to the Poisson prediction $1/\\bar{n}$,\nwhere $\\bar{n}$ is the mean halo number density. The eigenmode with the lowest\neigenvalue contains most of the information and the corresponding eigenvector\nprovides an optimal weighting function to minimize the stochasticity between\nhalos and dark matter. We find this optimal weighting function to match linear\nmass weighting at high masses, while at the low-mass end the weights approach a\nconstant whose value depends on the low-mass cut in the halo mass function.\nFinally, we employ the halo model to derive the stochasticity matrix and the\nscale-dependent bias from an analytical perspective. It is remarkably\nsuccessful in reproducing our numerical results and predicts that the\nstochasticity between halos and the dark matter can be reduced further when\ngoing to halo masses lower than we can resolve in current simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 13:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

These boundary conditions\nlead to a potential for directions in field space that would have been flat\nwere supersymmetry preserved. For field values in these directions much larger\nthan the supersymmetry-breaking scale, the flatness of the potential is nearly\nrestored. Starting in this nearly flat region, inflation can occur as the\ntheory relaxes towards the origin of field space. Near the origin, the\npotential becomes steep and the theory quickly descends to a confining gauge\ntheory in which the inflaton does not exist as a particle. This confining gauge\ntheory could be part of the Standard Model (QCD) or a natural dark matter\nsector; we comment on various scenarios for reheating. As a specific\nillustration of this mechanism, we discuss 4+1 dimensional maximally\nsupersymmetric gauge theory on a circle with antiperiodic boundary conditions\nfor fermions. When the theory is weakly coupled at the compactification scale,\nwe calculate the inflaton potential directly in field theory by integrating out\nthe heavy W-bosons and their superpartners. At strong coupling the model can be\nstudied using a gravity dual, which realizes a new model of brane inflation on\na non-supersymmetric throat geometry. Assuming there exists a UV completion\nthat avoids the eta-problem, predictions from our model are consistent with\npresent observations, and imply a small tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 20:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

Only recently has data with\nsufficiently high spectral resolution become available for investigating the\ndetails of the profiles of emission lines formed well above 10^6 K. These show\nenhanced emission in the line wings, which has not been understood yet. Line\nprofiles of Fe XV formed at 2.5 MK acquired by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) onboard the Hinode solar space observatory are studied using\nmulti Gaussian fits, with emphasis on the resulting line widths and Doppler\nshifts. In the major part of the active region, the spectra are best fit by a\nnarrow line core and a broad minor component. The latter contributes some 10%\nto 20% to the total emission, is about a factor of 2 broader than the core, and\nshows strong blueshifts of up to 50 km/s. On average, the line width increases\nfrom the footpoints to the loop top for both components. A component with high\nupflow speeds can be found also in small restricted areas. The coronal\nstructures consist of at least two classes that are not resolved spatially but\nonly spectroscopically and that are associated with the line core and the minor\ncomponent. Because of their huge line width and strong upflows, it is proposed\nthat the major part of the heating and the mass supply to the corona is\nactually located in source regions of the minor component. The siphon flows and\ndraining loops seen in the line core component are consistent with structures\nfound in a 3D MHD coronal model. Despite the quite different appearance of the\nlarge active region corona and small network elements seen in transition region\nlines, both show similar line profile characteristics. This indicates that the\nsame processes govern the heating and dynamics of the transition region and the\ncorona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 20:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 11:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It has been\nproposed that once the merger has been detected in gravitational waves (GWs) by\nLISA, follow-up EM searches for this afterglow can help identify the EM\ncounterpart of the LISA source. Here we study whether the afterglows may be\nsufficiently bright and numerous to be detectable in EM surveys alone. The\nviscous afterglow, which lasts for years to decades for SMBHBs in LISA's\nsensitivity window, is characterized by rapid increases in both the bolometric\nluminosity and in the spectral hardness of the source. If quasar activity is\ntriggered by the same major galaxy mergers that produce SMBHBs, then the\nafterglow could be interpreted as a signature of the birth of a quasar. Using\nan idealized model for the post-merger viscous spreading of the circumbinary\ndisk and the resulting light curve, and using the observed luminosity function\nof quasars as a proxy for the SMBHB merger rate, we delineate the survey\nrequirements for identifying such birthing quasars. If circumbinary disks have\na high disk surface density and viscosity, an all-sky soft X-ray survey with a\nsensitivity of ~<3x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and a time resolution of ~months could\nidentify dozens of birthing quasars with sustained brightening rates of\n>10%/yr. If >1% of the X-ray emission is reprocessed into optical frequencies,\nbirthing quasars could also be identified in optical transient surveys such as\nthe LSST. Distinguishing a birthing quasar from other variable sources may be\nfacilitated by the monotonic hardening of its spectrum, but will likely remain\nchallenging. This reinforces the notion that joint EM-plus-GW observations\noffer the best prospects for identifying the EM signatures of SMBHB mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 21:55:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 17:08:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 15:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\nmain hypotheses are the ones which suggest that some liquid, water or CO2, was\nresponsible for modeling the gullies and ones that propose dry flows as the\nmodeling agents. The aim of this work is to develop an alternative hypotetical\nmechanism of formation of Martian gullies.Our model proposes that the Martian\ngullies were formed as a result of a fluidization process of the material\ndeposited on the slopes of the impact craters, plateaux and other\ngeomorphologic structures. This fluidization is caused by the sublimation of\ncarbon dioxide ice deposited in the form of snow, due to the daily and seasonal\ntemperature changes. We also present the results of an experimental\nsimulation.Structures similar to the Martian gullies were reproduced using the\nair injection mechanism, as a substitute to gaseous CO2, on a sandy slope. The\nReynolds number for our experimental flow and for the flow in the Martian\ngullies was calculated and we found that they are of the same order, whilst the\nwater flows have much higher Reynolds numbers.Taking into account the current\nenvironmental conditions for Mars, from our results it may be suggested that\nthis mechanism is the possible modeling agent for the Martian gullies. Two of\nthe most important characteristics of the proposed model are: a) It offers a\nsimple explanation of how recurrent fluidization events occur in the same\nplace, a necessary recurrence of the formation of a gully, offering a\nrecharging mechanism for the system after every fluidization event, and b) It\nconsiders the formation of gullies possible even in angles smaller than the\nangle of repose.

In this paper we study the two-user Gaussian\ninterference channel with conferencing transmitters to make progress towards\nthis direction. We characterize the capacity region to within 6.5 bits/s/Hz,\nregardless of channel parameters.

These were combined with\npreviously published Q_b and Q_s values for 147 galaxies from the OSUBSGS\nsample and with the 12 galaxies from Block etal(2004). Weak correlation between\nQ_b and Q_s was confirmed for the combined sample, whereas the AAT subset alone\nshowed no significant correlations between Q_b and Q_s, nor between Q_b and\nA_2s. A similar negative result was obtained in Durbala etal. (2009) for 46\ngalaxies. Based on these studies, the answer to the above question remains\nuncertain. Here we use a novel approach, and show that although the correlation\nbetween the maximum bar and spiral parameters is weak, these parameters do\ncorrelate when compared locally.

First, selective constraints\naveraged over proteins are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of each 1-PAM\nmatrix of empirical amino acid (JTT, WAG, and LG) and codon (KHG) substitution\nmatrices. Then, selective constraints specific to given proteins are\napproximated as a linear function of those estimated from the empirical\nsubstitution matrices.\n  Akaike information criterion (AIC) values indicate that a model allowing\nmultiple nucleotide changes fits the empirical substitution matrices\nsignificantly better.

For this purpose we derive the expression for the GSF\ninstability with account of the thermal transport and smoothing of the\nmu-gradient by the horizontal turbulence. We apply the new expressions in\nnumerical models of a 20 solar mass star. We show that if N^2_{Omega} < 0 the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability cannot be killed by the stabilizing thermal and\nmu-gradients, so that the GSF instability is always there and we derive the\ncorresponding diffusion coefficient. The GSF instability grows towards the very\nlatest stages of stellar evolution. Close to the deep convective zones in\npre-supernova stages, the transport coefficient of elements and angular\nmomentum by the GSF instability can very locally be larger than the shear\ninstability and even as large as the thermal diffusivity. However the zones\nover which the GSF instability is acting are extremely narrow and there is not\nenough time left before the supernova explosion for a significant mixing to\noccur. Thus, even when the inhibiting effects of the mu-gradient are reduced by\nthe horizontal turbulence, the GSF instability remains insignificant for the\nevolution. We conclude that the GSF instability in pre-supernova stages cannot\nbe held responsible for the relatively low rotation rate of pulsars compared to\nthe predictions of rotating star models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 08:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We have\nfound that the curvaton is subdominant for the linear curvature perturbation,\nbut that a significant non-Gaussianity and a sizable tensor to scalar ratio are\ngenerated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 09:08:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 08:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 00:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

Studying the dynamics and formation of these systems can provide\nvaluable informations on processes taking place in protoplanetary disks where\nthe planets are thought have been formed. The recently discovered resonant\nsystem HD 60532 is the only confirmed case, in which the central star hosts a\npair of giant planets in 3:1 mean motion resonance. We intend to provide a\nphysical scenario for the formation of HD 60532, which is consistent with the\norbital solutions derived from the radial velocity measurements. Observations\nindicate that the system is in an antisymmetric configuration, while previous\ntheoretical investigations indicate an asymmetric equilibrium state. The paper\naims at answering this discrepancy as well. We performed two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of thin disks with an embedded pair of massive\nplanets. Additionally, migration and resonant capture are studied by\ngravitational N-body simulations that apply properly parametrized\nnon-conservative forces. Our simulations suggest that the capture into the 3:1\nmean motion resonance takes place only for higher planetary masses, thus\nfavouring orbital solutions having relatively smaller inclination i=20 degrees.\nThe system formed by numerical simulations qualitatively show the same\nbehaviour as HD 60532. We also find that the presence of an inner disk (between\nthe inner planet and the star) plays a very important role in determining the\nfinal configurations of resonant planetary systems. Its damping effect on the\ninner planet's eccentricity is responsible for the observed antisymmetric state\nof HD 60532.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 10:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Our main results are that: i) in\nboth increasing and narrow-magnitude-intervals the Faber-Jackson relation\nparameters change systematically, ii) non-parametric tests show that the\nfluctuations in the values of the slope of the Faber-Jackson relation are not\nproducts of chance variations. We conclude that the values of the Faber-Jackson\nrelation parameters depend on the width of the magnitude range and the\nluminosity of galaxies within the magnitude range. This dependence is caused,\nto a great extent by the selection effects and because the geometrical shape of\nthe distribution of galaxies on the $M - \\log (\\sigma_{0})$ plane depends on\nluminosity. We therefore emphasize that if the luminosity of galaxies or the\nwidth of the magnitude range or both are not taken into consideration when\ncomparing the structural relations of galaxy samples for different wavelengths,\nenvironments, redshifts and luminosities, any differences found may be\nmisinterpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 10:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Besides, any billiard trajectory inside\n$Q$ is tangent to $n$ caustics $Q_{\\lambda_1},...,Q_{\\lambda_n}$, so the\ncaustic parameters $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1,...,\\lambda_n)$ are integrals of the\nbilliard map.

We discuss the inconsistent use of the term \"traffic phase\" and show\nthat patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with\nsimple two-phase models, if the model parameters are suitably specified and\nfactors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered, such as effects\nof noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design (e.g. combinations of\noff- and on-ramps).

Temperature dependent capacitance\nmeasurements show that compressibility is sensitive to the intrinsic band gap.\nFor large displacements, an additional peak appears in the compressibility as a\nfunction of density, corresponding to the presence of a 1-dimensional van Hove\nsingularity (vHs) at the band edge arising from the quartic bilayer graphene\nband structure.

The story begins with 2-pile Nim whose\nsets of options and $P$-positions are $\\{\\{0,t\\}\\mid t\\in \\N\\}$ and\n$\\{(t,t)\\mid t\\in \\M \\}$ respectively. If we to 2-pile Nim adjoin the\nmain-\\emph{diagonal} $\\{(t,t)\\mid t\\in \\N\\}$ as options, the new game is\nWythoff Nim. It is well-known that the $P$-positions of this game lie on two\n'beams' originating at the origin with slopes $\\Phi= \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}>1$\nand $\\frac{1}{\\Phi} < 1$. Hence one may think of this as if, in the process of\ngoing from Nim to Wythoff Nim, the set of $P$-positions has \\emph{split} and\nlanded some distance off the main diagonal. This geometrical observation has\nmotivated us to ask the following intuitive question. Does this splitting of\nthe set of $P$-positions continue in some meaningful way if we, to the game of\nWythoff Nim, adjoin some new \\emph{generalized diagonal} move, that is a move\nof the form $\\{pt, qt\\}$, where $0 < p < q$ are fixed positive integers and $t\n> 0$? Does the answer perhaps depend on the specific values of $p$ and $q$? We\nstate three conjectures of which the weakest form is: $\\lim_{t\\in\n\\N}\\frac{b_t}{a_t}$ exists, and equals $\\Phi$, if and only if $(p, q)$ is a\ncertain \\emph{non-splitting pair}, and where $\\{\\{a_t, b_t\\}\\}$ represents the\nset of $P$-positions of the new game. Then we prove this conjecture for the\nspecial case $(p,q) = (1,2)$ (a \\emph{splitting pair}). We prove the other\ndirection whenever $q / p < \\Phi$.
