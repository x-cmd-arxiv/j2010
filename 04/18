Both features were long seen as obstructions of experimental\npossibilities that were available in the realm of classical physics. The birth\nof quantum information science was due to the realization that such\nobstructions can be turned into powerful resources. Here we review how the\nutilization of quantum fuzziness makes room for a notion of approximate joint\nmeasurement of noncommuting observables. We also show how from a classical\nperspective quantum uncertainty is due to a limitation of measurability\nreflected in a fuzzy event structure -- all quantum events are fundamentally\nunsharp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2010 20:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

The corresponding RSC estimator\nminimizes the Frobenius norm of the fit plus a regularization term proportional\nto the number of parameters in the reduced rank model. The rank of the RSC\nestimator provides a consistent estimator of the rank of the coefficient\nmatrix; in general, the rank of our estimator is a consistent estimate of the\neffective rank, which we define to be the number of singular values of the\ntarget matrix that are appropriately large. The consistency results are valid\nnot only in the classic asymptotic regime, when $n$, the number of responses,\nand $p$, the number of predictors, stay bounded, and $m$, the number of\nobservations, grows, but also when either, or both, $n$ and $p$ grow, possibly\nmuch faster than $m$. We establish minimax optimal bounds on the mean squared\nerrors of our estimators. Our finite sample performance bounds for the RSC\nestimator show that it achieves the optimal balance between the approximation\nerror and the penalty term. Furthermore, our procedure has very low\ncomputational complexity, linear in the number of candidate models, making it\nparticularly appealing for large scale problems. We contrast our estimator with\nthe nuclear norm penalized least squares (NNP) estimator, which has an\ninherently higher computational complexity than RSC, for multivariate\nregression models.

It\nwould be ideal to process a single image and extract two geometrically `pure'\nimages, each one containing features from only one of the two geometric\nconstituents. This seems to be a seriously underdetermined problem, but recent\nempirical work achieved highly persuasive separations. We present a theoretical\nanalysis showing that accurate geometric separation of point and curve\nsingularities can be achieved by minimizing the $\\ell_1$ norm of the\nrepresenting coefficients in two geometrically complementary frames: wavelets\nand curvelets. Driving our analysis is a specific property of the ideal (but\nunachievable) representation where each content type is expanded in the frame\nbest adapted to it. This ideal representation has the property that important\ncoefficients are clustered geometrically in phase space, and that at fine\nscales, there is very little coherence between a cluster of elements in one\nframe expansion and individual elements in the complementary frame. We formally\nintroduce notions of cluster coherence and clustered sparsity and use this\nmachinery to show that the underdetermined systems of linear equations can be\nstably solved by $\\ell_1$ minimization; microlocal phase space helps organize\nthe calculations that cluster coherence requires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2010 09:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}

This indicate that for these cases the hyperfine structure effects\ndue to QED could be ignored, and the dS-SR fine structure effects are dominant.\nThis effect could be used to determine the universal constant $R$ in dS-SR, and\nbe thought as a new physics beyond E-SR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2010 13:54:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 14:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 09:47:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 02:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 09:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-23"}

Yet, studies\nin this spectral domain are crucial to get complementary information on the\npresence of dust and/or on the physical processes such as dust heating and\nthermal bremsstrahlung. Here, we report a long-term multi-wavelength study of\nthe microquasar GRS 1915+105. On the one hand, we aimed at understanding the\norigins of the mid-infrared emission, and on the other hand, at searching for\ncorrelation with the high-energy and/or radio activities. We observed the\nsource at several epochs between 2004 and 2006 with the photometer IRAC and\nspectrometer IRS, both mounted on the Spitzer Space Telescope. When available,\nwe completed our set of data with quasi-simultaneous RXTE and INTEGRAL\nhigh-energy and/or Ryle radio observations from public archives. We then\nstudied the mid-infrared environment and activities of GRS 1915+105 through\nspectral analysis and broad band fitting of its radio to X-ray spectral energy\ndistributions. We detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in all but\none IRS spectra of GRS 1915+105 which unambiguously proves the presence of a\ndust component, likely photoionised by the high-energy emission. We also argue\nthat this dust is distributed in a disc-like structure heated by the companion\nstar, as observed in some Herbig Ae/Be and isolated cool giant stars. Moreover,\nwe show that some of the soft X-ray emission emanating from the inner regions\nof the accretion disc is reprocessed and thermalised in the outer part. This\nleads to a mid-infrared excess that is very likely correlated to the soft X-ray\nemission. We exclude thermal bremsstrahlung as contributing significantly in\nthis spectral domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2010 15:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 23:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
