Software developers also worry\nabout their applications being reverse engineered by extracting data structures\nand algorithms from an application and incorporated into competitor's code. A\ndefense against software piracy is watermarking, a process that embeds a secret\nmessage in a cover software. Watermarking is a method that does not aim to stop\npiracy copying, but to prove ownership of the software and possibly even the\ndata structures and algorithms used in the software. The language Java was\ndesigned to be compiled into a platform independent bytecode format. Much of\nthe information contained in the source code remains in the bytecode, which\nmeans that decompilation is easier than with traditional native codes. In this\nthesis, we present a technique for watermarking Java programs by using a\nnever-executed dummy method (Monden et.al., 2000) combined with opaque\npredicates (Collberg et.al., 1998; Arboit, 2002) and improved with dynamically\nopaque predicates (Palsberg et.al., 2000). This work presents a method to\nconstruct a dynamic opaque predicates by grouping two or more opaque predicates\naccording to predefined rules. Any software watermarking technique will exhibit\na trade-off between resilience, data rate, cost, and stealth. To evaluate the\nquality of a watermarking scheme we must also know how well it stands up to\ndifferent types of attacks. Ideally, we would like our watermarks to survive\ntranslation (compilation, decompilation, and binary translation), optimization,\nand obfuscation.

The DC Josephson effect is\nthe pseudo-Goldstone boson of two coupled systems with a broken continuous\nabelian U(1) symmetry. Hence, an analog should exist for systems with broken\ncontinuous non-Abelian symmetries. To exhibit the generality of the phenomenon\nand make predictions from a realistic model, we study tunneling between\nantiferromagnets and also between antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors.\nPerforming a calculation analogous to that of Ambegaokar and Baratoff for the\nJosephson junction, we find an equilibrium current of the staggered\nmagnetization through the junction that, in antiferromagnets, is proportional\nto s_L X s_R where s_L and s_R are the Neel vectors on either sides of the\njunction. Microscopically, this effect exists because of the coherent tunneling\nof spin-one particle-hole pairs. In the presence of a magnetic field which is\ndifferent on either sides of the junction, we find an analog of the AC\nJosephson effect where the angle between Neel vectors depends on time. In the\ncase of antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors we predict that there is a\ncontribution to the critical current that depends on the antiferromagnetic\norder and a contribution to the spin-critical current that depends on\nsuperconducting order. The latter contributions come from tunneling of the\ntriplet Cooper pair that is necessarily present in the ground state of an\nantiferromagnetic d-wave superconductor. All these effects appear to leading\norder in the square of the tunneling matrix elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 17:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}

These problems are highly nonlinear. As the process of Multiple\nCriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is much expanded most MOO problems in different\ndisciplines can be classified on the basis of it. Thus MCDM methods have gained\nwide popularity in different sciences and applications. Meanwhile the\nincreasing number of involved components, variables, parameters, constraints\nand objectives in the process, has made the process very complicated. However\nthe new generation of MOO tools has made the optimization process more\nautomated, but still initializing the process and setting the initial value of\nsimulation tools and also identifying the effective input variables and\nobjectives in order to reach the smaller design space are still complicated. In\nthis situation adding a preprocessing step into the MCDM procedure could make a\nhuge difference in terms of organizing the input variables according to their\neffects on the optimization objectives of the system. The aim of this paper is\nto introduce the classification task of data mining as an effective option for\nidentifying the most effective variables of the MCDM systems. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method an example has been given for 3D wing\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 17:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}

A modification of this simple\ntechnique has been applied to the detection of minor bodies in the Solar\nSystem: first stationary objects are removed through the subtraction of a\nhigh-SN template image, then the sky motion of the Solar System bodies of\ninterest is predicted and compensated for by shifting pixels in software prior\nto the co-addition step.

Together with the galaxies, the\nparallel growth of BHs is followed in time and their feedback on the hosting\ngalaxies is modelled. We set the model free parameters by matching with data on\nlocal stellar mass functions and the BH-bulge relation at z=0.

Since both processes are currently strongly constrained\nby cosmological near- and far-IR surveys, the basic physics of the Lambda CDM\nhierarchical clustering concept of galaxy formation can be effectively tested\nby us by comparison with the most reliable set of observables. Our\ninvestigation shows that when the time-scales of the stellar formation and mass\nassembly are studied as a function of dark matter halo mass and the single\ngalaxy stellar mass, the 'downsizing' fashion of star formation appears to be a\nnatural outcome of the model, reproduced even in the absence of the AGN\nfeedback.

The morphology of the\ncolor-magnitude-diagram (CMD) of M67 around the turn-off shows a clear\nhook-like feature, direct sign that stars close to the turn-off have convective\ncores.

We also study the importance of other constitutive physics on\ndetermining the presence of such a hook, particularly element diffusion,\novershooting and nuclear reaction rates.

The BCS/MMT spectra yield precise\nestimates of the HI column densities (NHI) of the systems through Voigt profile\nanalysis of their Lya transitions. Nearly all of the cMSDLAs (41/43) satisfy\nthe NHI criterion of DLAs, 10^20.3. As a population, these systems have\nsystematically higher NHI values than DLAs chosen randomly from quasar\nsightlines. Combining our NHI measurements with previously measured metal\ncolumn densities, we estimate metallicities for the MSDLAs. These systems have\nsignificantly higher values than randomly selected DLAs; at z~2, the MSDLAs\nshow a median metallicity [M/H] ~ -0.67 that is 0.6dex higher than a\ncorresponding control sample.

Analyzing three exposures of this z = 1.71 QSO, we find\ntwo distinct types of calibration shifts needed to correct the Th/Ar wavelength\nscale. First, there is an overall average velocity shift of between 100 m/s and\n500 m/s depending upon the exposure. Second, within a given exposure, we find\nintra-order velocity distortions of 100 m/s up to more than 200 m/s.

The MMSE\ncan be regarded as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as a\nfunctional of the input distribution (of the random variable to be estimated).\nIt is shown that the MMSE is concave in the input distribution at any given\nSNR. For a given input distribution, the MMSE is found to be infinitely\ndifferentiable at all positive SNR, and in fact a real analytic function in SNR\nunder mild conditions. The key to these regularity results is that the\nposterior distribution conditioned on the observation through Gaussian channels\nalways decays at least as quickly as some Gaussian density. Furthermore, simple\nexpressions for the first three derivatives of the MMSE with respect to the SNR\nare obtained. It is also shown that, as functions of the SNR, the curves for\nthe MMSE of a Gaussian input and that of a non-Gaussian input cross at most\nonce over all SNRs.

Near\nthe end of the first accretion phase, conditions are just right for the\nexplosive conversion of the neutron star to a quark star (Quark-Nova). In our\nmodel, the subsequent interaction of material from the neutron star's ejected\ncrust with the circumbinary disk explains the duration, variability and\nnear-universal nature of the prompt emission in short-hard GRBs.

On large scales,\n\\xi (r_p, \\pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streaming\nfrom coherent infall. On scales 1 Mpc/h < r_p < 10 Mpc/h, the projected\nauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-law\nwith slope \\gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \\gamma\n~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 Mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. Compared to the\nclustering of a fiducial L* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relative\nbias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. The w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies display\nan increase in convexity at ~ 1 Mpc/h, with an excess of large scale\nclustering. Our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likely\ncentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies have\nlarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.\nIf blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes like\nmergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such a\ntransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to any\nchange in luminosity and color.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 08:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This has generated the conviction that in the past\nearly-type galaxies were more compact, hence denser, and that as a consequence,\nthey should have increased their radius across the time to reconcile with the\npresent-day ones. However, observations have not yet established whether the\npopulation of early-types in the early Universe was fully represented by\ncompact galaxies nor if they were so much more numerous than in the present-day\nUniverse to require an evolution of their sizes. Here we report the results of\na study based on a complete sample of 34 early-type galaxies at\n0.9<z_{spec}<1.92. We find a majority (62 per cent) of normal early-type\ngalaxies similar to typical local ones, co-existing with compact early-types\nfrom ~2 to ~6 times smaller in spite of the same mass and redshift. The\nco-existence of normal and compact early-type galaxies at <z>~1.5 suggests that\ntheir build-up taken place in the first 3-4 Gyr, followed distinct paths. Also,\nwe find that the number density of compact early-types at <z>~1.5 is consistent\nwith the lower limits of the local number density of compact early-types\nderived from local clusters of galaxies. The similar number of compact\nearly-types found in the early and in the present day Universe frustrates the\nhypothesized effective radius evolution while provides evidence that also\ncompact ETGs were as we see them today 9-10 Gyr ago. Finally, the fact that (at\nleast) most of the compact ETGs at high-z are accounted for by compact\nearly-types in local cluster of galaxies implies that the former are the direct\nprogenitors of the compact early-type cluster galaxies establishing a direct\nlink between environment and early phases of assembly of ETGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 10:49:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2010 08:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 08:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

These suggest\nthat the Serpens cloud core first contracted along the magnetic field to be an\nelongated cloud, which is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and that then\nthe central part contracted cross the magnetic field due to the high density in\nthe central region of the cloud core, where star formation is actively\ncontinuing.

According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the\nother hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy\n($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to\nthe kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile\n$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must\nbe long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson\nnumber $Ri>1/4$.

In this paper, we propose to study the factoring\nrelation up to rescalings, and ask for the existence of universal objects for\nthat simulation relation. In classical simulations of a system S by a system T,\nthe simulation takes place on a specific subset of configurations of T\ndepending on S (this is the case for intrinsic universality).

Firstly, the stability of a circular disk is analysed with respect to\nsmall-amplitude harmonic edge perturbations. Analytical solution shows that the\nedge deformations with the azimuthal wavenumbers m=2,3,4... start to develop as\nthe magnetic Bond number exceeds the critical threshold Bm_c=3pi(m+1)/2.

The edge instability is found to result in the equilibrium\nshapes of either two- or threefold rotational symmetry depending on the\nmagnetic field strength and the initial perturbation. The shapes of higher\nrotational symmetries are unstable and fall back to one of these two basic\nstates.

The\natmospheres of AGB stars can be strongly affected by stellar pulsation and the\ndevelopment of a stellar wind, though, and the abundance determination of these\nobjects should therefore be based on dynamic model atmospheres. We investigate\nthe effects of stellar pulsation and mass loss on the appearance of selected\nspectral features (line profiles, line intensities) and on the derived\nelemental abundances by performing a systematic comparison of hydrostatic and\ndynamic model atmospheres. High-resolution synthetic spectra in the near\ninfrared range were calculated based on two dynamic model atmospheres (at\nvarious phases during the pulsation cycle) as well as a grid of hydrostatic\nCOMARCS models. Equivalent widths of a selection of atomic and molecular lines\nwere derived in both cases and compared with each other. In the case of the\ndynamic models, the equivalent widths of all investigated features vary over\nthe pulsation cycle. A consistent reproduction of the derived variations with a\nset of hydrostatic models is not possible, but several individual phases and\nspectral features can be reproduced well with the help of specific hydrostatic\natmospheric models. In addition, we show that the variations in equivalent\nwidth that we found on the basis of the adopted dynamic model atmospheres agree\nqualitatively with observational results for the Mira R Cas over its light\ncycle. The findings of our modelling form a starting point to deal with the\nproblem of abundance determination in strongly dynamic AGB stars (i.e.,\nlong-period variables).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 15:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
