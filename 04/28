A lifetime measurement must correct for this\nbias and the conventional approach has been to use a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the conventional approach are\ndue to differences between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation.

Second we address a general direct image problem in complex\ngeometry: pushing forward a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle $E-->Y$ along a\nnon-proper map $Y-->S$. We give criteria for the direct image to be a smooth\nfield of Hilbert spaces. Third we consider quantizing an analytic Riemannian\nmanifold $M$ by endowing $TM$ with the family of adapted K\\\"ahler structures\nfrom arxiv:1004.4069 [LSz]. This leads to a direct image problem. When $M$ is\nhomogeneous, we prove the direct image is an analytic field of Hilbert spaces.\nFor certain such $M$---but not all---the direct image is even flat; which means\nthat in those cases quantization is unique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 16:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 11:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

However,\ndespite major progress, the general question of polynomial learnability of\nGaussian mixture distributions still remained open. The current work resolves\nthe question of polynomial learnability for Gaussian mixtures in high dimension\nwith an arbitrary fixed number of components. The result on learning Gaussian\nmixtures relies on an analysis of distributions belonging to what we call\n\"polynomial families\" in low dimension. These families are characterized by\ntheir moments being polynomial in parameters and include almost all common\nprobability distributions as well as their mixtures and products. Using tools\nfrom real algebraic geometry, we show that parameters of any distribution\nbelonging to such a family can be learned in polynomial time and using a\npolynomial number of sample points. The result on learning polynomial families\nis quite general and is of independent interest. To estimate parameters of a\nGaussian mixture distribution in high dimensions, we provide a deterministic\nalgorithm for dimensionality reduction. This allows us to reduce learning a\nhigh-dimensional mixture to a polynomial number of parameter estimations in low\ndimension. Combining this reduction with the results on polynomial families\nyields our result on learning arbitrary Gaussian mixtures in high dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 16:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-13"}

We propose here an improved method of determining the basic stellar\nparameters using the data from the cooling phase of photospheric radius\nexpansion bursts covering a large range of luminosities. Because at that phase\nthe blackbody apparent radius depends only on the spectral hardening factor\n(color-correction), we suggest to fit the theoretical dependences of the\ncolor-correction versus flux in Eddington units to the observed variations of\nthe inverse square root of the apparent blackbody radius with the flux. We show\nthat spectral variations observed during a long photospheric radius expansion\nburst from 4U 1724-307 are entirely consistent with the theoretical\nexpectations for the passively cooling neutron star atmospheres. Our method\nallows us to determine both the Eddington flux (which is found to be smaller\nthan the touchdown flux by 15%) and the ratio of the stellar apparent radius to\nthe distance much more reliably. We then find a lower limit on the neutron star\nradius of 14 km for masses below 2.2M_sun, independently of the chemical\ncomposition. These results suggest that the matter inside neutron stars is\ncharacterized by a stiff equation of state. We finally show that the apparent\nblackbody emitting area in the cooling tails of the short bursts from 4U\n1724-307 is two times smaller than that for the long burst and their evolution\ndoes not follow the theory. This makes their usage for determination of the\nneutron star parameters questionable and casts serious doubts on the results of\nprevious works that used for the analysis similar bursts from other sources.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 17:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jan 2011 12:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 15:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Due to the degeneracy of gaugino states, the conventional leptonic signals\nare likely lost. We first consider the leading signal from gluino production\nand decay. We find that it is quite conceivable to reach a large statistical\nsignificance for the multi-jet plus missing energy signal with an integrated\nluminosity about 50 pb^-1 (50 fb^-1) for a gluino mass of 500 GeV (1 TeV). If\ngluinos are not too heavy, less than about 1.5 TeV, this channel can typically\nprobe gaugino masses up to about 100 GeV below the gluino mass. We then study\nthe Drell-Yan type of gaugino pair production in association with a hard QCD\njet, for gaugino masses in the range of 100-150 GeV. The signal observation may\nbe statistically feasible with about 10 fb^-1, but systematically challenging\ndue to the lack of distinctive features for the signal distributions. By\nexploiting gaugino pair production through weak boson fusion, signals of large\nmissing energy plus two forward-backward jets may be observable at a 4-6\\sigma\nlevel above the large SM backgrounds with an integrated luminosity of 100-300\nfb^-1. Finally, we point out that searching for additional isolated soft muons\nin the range p_T ~3-10 GeV in the data samples discussed above may help to\nenrich the signal and to control the systematics.

In this paper, we introduce a new\ntechnique for graph sparsification, namely refinement sampling, that gives an\n\\tilde{O}(m) time semi-streaming algorithm for graph sparsification.\n  Specifically, we show that refinement sampling can be used to design a\none-pass streaming algorithm for sparsification that takes O(\\log\\log n) time\nper edge, uses O(\\log^2 n) space per node, and outputs an \\eps-sparsifier with\nO(n\\log^3 n/\\eps^2) edges. At a slightly increased space and time complexity,\nwe can reduce the sparsifier size to O(n \\log n/\\e^2) edges matching the\nBenczur-Karger result, while improving upon the Benczur-Karger runtime for\nm=\\omega(n\\log^3 n). Finally, we show that an \\eps-sparsifier with O(n \\log\nn/\\eps^2) edges can be constructed in two passes over the data and O(m) time\nwhenever m =\\Omega(n^{1+\\delta}) for some constant \\delta>0. As a by-product of\nour approach, we also obtain an O(m\\log\\log n+n \\log n) time streaming\nalgorithm to compute a sparse k-connectivity certificate of a graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 21:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In previous works, the NDW has been implicated as a possible\nsource of r-process and light p-process isotopes. In this paper we present\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the NDW which\ninclude accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction\nnetwork. Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities, we predict\nthe contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the\nentire supernova. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no true\nr-process occurs in the most basic scenario. The wind driven from an older $1.4\nM_\\odot$ model for a PNS is moderately neutron-rich at late times however, and\nproduces $^{87}$Rb, $^{88}$Sr, $^{89}$Y, and $^{90}$Zr in near solar\nproportions relative to oxygen. The wind from a more recently studied $1.27\nM_\\odot$ PNS is proton-rich throughout its entire evolution and does not\ncontribute significantly to the abundance of any element. It thus seems very\nunlikely that the simplest model of the NDW can produce the r-process. At most,\nit contributes to the production of the N = 50 closed shell elements and some\nlight p-nuclei. In doing so, it may have left a distinctive signature on the\nabundances in metal poor stars, but the results are sensitive to both uncertain\nmodels for the explosion and the masses of the neutron stars involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 21:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

That theory was shown to enjoy analogs of most of the standard\nalgebraic properties of group cohomology, but various analytic features of\nthose cohomology groups were only partially understood.\n  This paper re-examines some of those issues. At its heart is a simple\ndimension-shifting argument which enables one to `regularize' measurable\ncocycles, leading to some simplifications in the description of the cohomology\ngroups. A range of consequences are then derived from this argument.\n  First, we prove that for target modules that are Fr\\'echet spaces, the\ncohomology groups agree with those defined using continuous cocycles, and hence\nthey vanish in positive degrees when the acting group is compact. Using this,\nwe then show that for Fr\\'echet, discrete or toral modules the cohomology\ngroups are continuous under forming inverse limits of compact base groups, and\nalso under forming direct limits of discrete target modules.\n  Lastly, these results together enable us to establish various circumstances\nunder which the measurable-cochains cohomology groups coincide with others\ndefined using sheaves on a semi-simplicial space associated to the underlying\ngroup, or sheaves on a classifying space for that group. We also prove in some\ncases that the natural quotient topologies on the measurable-cochains\ncohomology groups are Hausdorff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 00:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 18:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 18:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 18:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

The factorization structures are represented by\nhypergraphs called factor graphs. Such distributions appear in various fields,\nincluding statistics, artificial intelligence, statistical physics, error\ncorrecting codes, etc. Given such a distribution, computations of marginal\ndistributions and the normalization constant are often required. However, they\nare computationally intractable because of their computational costs. One\nsuccessful approximation method is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm.\nThe focus of this thesis is an analysis of the LBP algorithm. If the factor\ngraph is a tree, i.e. having no cycle, the algorithm gives the exact\nquantities. If the factor graph has cycles, however, the LBP algorithm does not\ngive exact results and possibly exhibits oscillatory and non-convergent\nbehaviors. The thematic question of this thesis is \"How the behaviors of the\nLBP algorithm are affected by the discrete geometry of the factor graph?\" The\nprimary contribution of this thesis is the discovery of a formula that\nestablishes the relation between the LBP, the Bethe free energy and the graph\nzeta function. This formula provides new techniques for analysis of the LBP\nalgorithm, connecting properties of the graph and of the LBP and the Bethe free\nenergy. We demonstrate applications of the techniques to several problems\nincluding (non) convexity of the Bethe free energy, the uniqueness and\nstability of the LBP fixed point. We also discuss the loop series initiated by\nChertkov and Chernyak. The loop series is a subgraph expansion of the\nnormalization constant, or partition function, and reflects the graph geometry.\nWe investigate theoretical natures of the series. Moreover, we show a partial\nconnection between the loop series and the graph zeta function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 02:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 06:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-24"}

The required high-dimensional\nvolatility matrix can be estimated by using high frequency financial data. This\nenables us to better adapt to the local volatilities and local correlations\namong vast number of assets and to increase significantly the sample size for\nestimating the volatility matrix. This paper studies the volatility matrix\nestimation using high-dimensional high-frequency data from the perspective of\nportfolio selection. Specifically, we propose the use of \"pairwise-refresh\ntime\" and \"all-refresh time\" methods proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen et al (2008)\nfor estimation of vast covariance matrix and compare their merits in the\nportfolio selection. We also establish the concentration inequalities of the\nestimates, which guarantee desirable properties of the estimated volatility\nmatrix in vast asset allocation with gross exposure constraints. Extensive\nnumerical studies are made via carefully designed simulations. Comparing with\nthe methods based on low frequency daily data, our methods can capture the most\nrecent trend of the time varying volatility and correlation, hence provide more\naccurate guidance for the portfolio allocation in the next time period. The\nadvantage of using high-frequency data is significant in our simulation and\nempirical studies, which consist of 50 simulated assets and 30 constituent\nstocks of Dow Jones Industrial Average index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 06:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

The lower bounds that are known to\nfollow from derandomization of (low-degree) multivariate identity testing are\nweaker. To obtain our lower bound it would be sufficient to derandomize\nidentity testing for polynomials of a very specific norm: sums of products of\nsparse polynomials with sparse coefficients. This observation leads to new\nversions of the Shub-Smale tau-conjecture on integer roots of univariate\npolynomials. In particular, we show that a lower bound for the permanent would\nfollow if one could give a good enough bound on the number of real roots of\nsums of products of sparse polynomials (Descartes' rule of signs gives such a\nbound for sparse polynomials and products thereof).

Here, we\nfollow time courses of signaling in response to concentration step changes of\nattractant using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements.\nSpecifically, we use a condensed representation of adaptation time courses for\nefficient evaluation of different adaptation models. To quantitatively explain\nthe data, we finally develop a dynamic model for signaling and adaptation based\non the attractant flow in the experiment, signaling by cooperative receptor\ncomplexes, and multiple layers of feedback regulation for adaptation. We\nexperimentally confirm the predicted effects of changing the enzyme-expression\nlevel and bypassing the negative feedback for demethylation. Our data analysis\nsuggests significant imprecision in adaptation for large additions.\nFurthermore, our model predicts highly regulated, ultrafast adaptation in\nresponse to removal of attractant, which may be useful for fast reorientation\nof the cell and noise reduction in adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 10:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 10:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A suspension drop is modelled by a cloud\nof many non-touching particles, initially randomly distributed inside a\nspherical volume of a viscous fluid which is identical to the host fluid\noutside the drop. Evolution of particle positions and velocities is evaluated\nby the accurate multipole method corrected for lubrication, implemented in the\n{\\sc hydromultipole} numerical code. Deformation of the drop is shown to be\nsmaller for a larger volume fraction. At high concentrations, hydrodynamic\ninteractions between close particles significantly decrease elongation of the\nsuspension drop along the flow in comparison to the corresponding elongation of\nthe pure-fluid drop. Owing to hydrodynamic interactions, the particles inside a\ndense-suspension drop tend to stay for a long time together in the central part\nof the drop; later on, small clusters occasionally separate out from the drop,\nand are stabilized by quasi-periodic orbits of the constituent non-touching\nparticles. Both effects significantly reduces the drop spreading along the\nflow. At large volume fractions, suspension drops destabilize by fragmentation,\nand at low volume fractions, by dispersing into single particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 11:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The approach uses classical and quantum versions of normal form\ntheory and the perspective of dynamical systems theory. Over the past ten years\nthe classical normal form theory has provided a method for realizing the phase\nspace structures that are responsible for determining reactions in high\ndimensional Hamiltonian systems. This has led to the understanding that a new\n(to reaction dynamics) type of phase space structure, a {\\em normally\nhyperbolic invariant manifold} (or, NHIM) is the \"anchor\" on which the phase\nspace structures governing reaction dynamics are built. The quantum normal form\ntheory provides a method for quantizing these phase space structures through\nthe use of the Weyl quantization procedure. We show that this approach provides\na solution of the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation leading to a (local)\nS-matrix in a neighborhood of the saddle point governing the reaction. It\nfollows easily that the quantization of the directional flux through the\ndividing surface with the properties noted above is a flux operator that can be\nexpressed in a \"closed form\". Moreover, from the local S-matrix we easily\nobtain an expression for the cumulative reactio probability (CRP).\nSignificantly, the expression for the CRP can be evaluated without the need to\ncompute classical trajectories. The quantization of the NHIM is shown to lead\nto the activated complex, and the lifetimes of quantum states initialized on\nthe NHIM correspond to the Gamov-Siegert resonances. We apply these results to\nthe collinear nitrogen exchange reaction and a three degree-of-freedom system\ncorresponding to an Eckart barrier coupled to two Morse oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 12:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-15"}

CS combines the important task of compression\ndirectly with the measurement task. Since its introduction in 2004 there have\nbeen hundreds of manuscripts on CS, a large fraction of which develop\nalgorithms to recover a signal from its compressed measurements. Because of the\nparadoxical nature of CS -- exact reconstruction from seemingly undersampled\nmeasurements -- it is crucial for acceptance of an algorithm that rigorous\nanalyses verify the degree of undersampling the algorithm permits. The\nRestricted Isometry Property (RIP) has become the dominant tool used for the\nanalysis in such cases. We present here an asymmetric form of RIP which gives\ntighter bounds than the usual symmetric one. We give the best known bounds on\nthe RIP constants for matrices from the Gaussian ensemble. Our derivations\nillustrate the way in which the combinatorial nature of CS is controlled. Our\nquantitative bounds on the RIP allow precise statements as to how aggressively\na signal can be undersampled, the essential question for practitioners. We also\ndocument the extent to which RIP gives precise information about the true\nperformance limits of CS, by comparing with approaches from high-dimensional\ngeometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 13:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

The survey uses\ncollisionless tracers in the form of disk stars to measure the surface-density\nof spiral disks, to provide an absolute calibration of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, and to yield robust estimates of the dark-matter halo\ndensity profile in the inner regions of galaxies. We find a disk inclination\nrange of 25-35 degrees is optimal for our measurements, consistent with our\nsurvey design to select nearly face-on galaxies. Uncertainties in disk\nscale-heights are significant, but can be estimated from radial scale-lengths\nto 25% now, and more precisely in the future. We detail the spectroscopic\nanalysis used to derive line-of-sight velocity dispersions, precise at low\nsurface-brightness, and accurate in the presence of composite stellar\npopulations. Our methods take full advantage of large-grasp integral-field\nspectroscopy and an extensive library of observed stars. We show that the\nbaryon-to-total mass fraction (F_b) is not a well-defined observational\nquantity because it is coupled to the halo mass model. This remains true even\nwhen the disk mass is known and spatially-extended rotation curves are\navailable. In contrast, the fraction of the rotation speed supplied by the disk\nat 2.2 scale lengths (disk maximality) is a robust observational indicator of\nthe baryonic disk contribution to the potential. We construct the error-budget\nfor the key quantities: dynamical disk mass surface-density, disk stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, and disk maximality (V_disk / V_circular). Random and\nsystematic errors in these quantities for individual galaxies will be ~25%,\nwhile survey precision for sample quartiles are reduced to 10%, largely devoid\nof systematic errors outside of distance uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 14:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Massive stars have high-multiplicity fractions, and many of them\nhave still undetected components, thus hampering the study of their properties.\nAIMS. I study a sample of massive stars with high angular resolution to better\ncharacterize their multiplicity. METHODS. I observed 138 fields that include at\nleast one massive star with AstraLux, a lucky imaging camera at the 2.2 m Calar\nAlto telescope. I also used observations of 3 of those fields with ACS/HRC on\nHST to obtain complementary information and to calibrate the AstraLux data. The\nresults were compared with existing information from the Washington Double Star\nCatalog, Tycho-2, 2MASS, and other literature results. RESULTS. I discover 16\nnew optical companions of massive stars, the majority of which are likely to be\nphysically bound to their primaries. I also improve the accuracy for the\nseparation and magnitude difference of many previously known systems. In a few\ncases the orbital motion is detected when comparing the new data with existing\nones and constraints on the orbits are provided. CONCLUSIONS. The analysis\nindicate that the majority of the AstraLux detections are bound pairs. For a\nrange of separations of 0.1\"-14\" and magnitude differences lower than 8, I find\nthat the multiplicity fraction for massive stars is close to 50%.

Confinement is induced by two\nparallel planar hard walls (slit-pore geometry), with particle long axes\nperpendicular to the walls (perfect homeotropic anchoring). In bulk, a\ncontinuous nematic-to-smectic transition takes place, while shape anisotropy in\nthe (rectangular) particle cross section induces biaxial ordering. As a\nconsequence, four bulk phases, uniaxial and biaxial nematic and smectic phases,\ncan be stabilised as the cross-sectional aspect ratio is varied. On confining\nthe fluid, the nematic-to-smectic transition is suppressed, and either uniaxial\nor biaxial phases, separated by a continuous trasition, can be present. Smectic\nordering develops continuously from the walls for increasing particle\nconcentration (in agreement with the supression of nematic-smectic second order\ntransition at confinement), but first-order layering transitions, involving\nstructures with n and n+1 layers, arise in the confined fluid at high\nconcentration. Competition between layering and uniaxial-biaxial ordering leads\nto three different types of layering transitions, at which the two coexisting\nstructures can be both uniaxial, one uniaxial and another biaxial, or both\nbiaxial. Also, the interplay between molecular biaxiality and wall interactions\nis very subtle: while the hard wall disfavours the formation of the biaxial\nphase, biaxiality is against the layering transitions, as we have shown by\ncomparing the confined phase behaviour of cylinders and cuboids.

On the basis of this point, we calculate the invariant Lyapunov\nexponents (LEs) for one of the spinning compact binaries in the conservative\nsecond post-Newtonian (2PN) Lagrangian formulation without the dissipative\neffects of gravitational radiation, using the two-nearby-orbits method with\nprojection operations and with coordinate time as an independent variable. It\nis found that the actual source leading to zero LEs in one paper [J. D.\nSchnittman and F. A. Rasio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 121101 (2001)] but to positive\nLEs in the other [N. J. Cornish and J. Levin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 179001\n(2002)] does not mainly depend on rescaling, but is due to two slightly\ndifferent treatments of the LEs. It takes much more CPU time to obtain the\nstabilizing limit values as reliable values of LEs for the former than to get\nthe slopes (equal to LEs) of the fit lines for the latter. Due to coalescence\nof some of the black holes, the LEs from the former are not an adaptive\nindicator of chaos for comparable mass compact binaries. In this case, the\ninvariant fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) of two-nearby orbits, as a very\nsensitive tool to distinguish chaos from order, is worth recommending. As a\nresult, we do again find chaos in the 2PN approximation through different\nratios of FLIs varying with time. Chaos cannot indeed be ruled out in real\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 15:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

This morphology is\ninteresting because it is generally accepted that a typical ring forms when\nmaterial collects near a resonance, set up by the pattern speed of a bar or\nbar-like perturbation. Our goal in this paper is to examine whether the ring\nstar formation properties are related to the non-axisymmetric gravity potential\nin general. For this purpose, we obtained H{\\alpha} emission line images and\ncalculated the line fluxes and star formation rates (SFRs) for 16 nonbarred SA\ngalaxies and four weakly barred SAB galaxies with rings. For comparison, we\ncombine our observations with a re-analysis of previously published data on\nfive SA, seven SAB, and 15 SB galaxies with rings, three of which are\nduplicates from our sample. With these data, we examine what role a bar may\nplay in the star formation process in rings. Compared to barred ringed\ngalaxies, we find that the inner ring SFRs and H{\\alpha}+[N ii] equivalent\nwidths in nonbarred ringed galaxies show a similar range and trend with\nabsolute blue magnitude, revised Hubble type, and other parameters. On the\nwhole, the star formation properties of inner rings, excluding the distribution\nof H ii regions, are independent of the ring shapes and the bar strength in our\nsmall samples. We confirm that the deprojected axis ratios of inner rings\ncorrelate with maximum relative gravitational force Q_g; however, if we\nconsider all rings, a better correlation is found when local bar forcing at the\nradius of the ring, Q_r, is used. Individual cases are described and other\ncorrelations are discussed. By studying the physical properties of these\ngalaxies, we hope to gain a better understanding of their placement in the\nscheme of the Hubble sequence and how they formed rings without the driving\nforce of a bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 15:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We aim to analyse the star formation\nproperties in the bar region of NGC 2903 and study the links with the typical\nbar morphological features. A combination of space and ground-based data from\nthe far-ultraviolet to the sub-millimeter spectral ranges is used to create a\npanchromatic view of the NGC 2903 bar. We produce two catalogues: one for the\ncurrent star formation regions, as traced by the halpha compact emission, and a\nsecond one for the ultraviolet (UV) emitting knots, containing positions and\nluminosities. From them we have obtained ultraviolet colours, star formation\nrates, dust attenuation and halpha EWs, and their spatial distribution have\nbeen analysed. Stellar cluster ages have been estimated using stellar\npopulation synthesis models (Starburst99). NGC 2903 is a complex galaxy, with a\nvery different morphology on each spectral band. The CO(J=1-0) and the 3.6\nmicron emission trace each other in a clear barred structure, while the halpha\nleads both components and it has an s-shape distribution. The UV emission is\npatchy and does not resemble a bar. The UV emission is also characterised by a\nnumber of regions located symmetrically with respect to the galaxy center,\nalmost perpendicular to the bar, in a spiral shape covering the inner ~2.5 kpc.\nThese regions do not show a significant halpha nor 24 micron emission. We have\nestimated ages for these regions ranging from 150 to 320 Myr, being older than\nthe rest of the UV knots, which have ages lower than 10 Myr. The SFR calculated\nfrom the UV emission is ~0.4 M$_{\\odot}$/yr, compatible with the SFR as derived\nfrom halpha calibrations (M$_{\\odot}$/yr).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 15:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
