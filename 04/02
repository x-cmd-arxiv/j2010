However, they\nare known to overestimate charge transfer for widely separated atoms, leading\nto qualitative errors in the predicted charge distribution and exaggerated\nelectrostatic properties. We present the charge transfer with polarization\ncurrent equilibration (QTPIE) model, which solves this problem by introducing\ndistance-dependent electronegativities. A graph-theoretic analysis of the\ntopology of charge transfer allows us to relate the fundamental quantities of\ncharge transfer back to the more familiar variables that represent atomic\npartial charges. This allows us to formulate a unified theoretical framework\nfor fluctuating-charge models and topological charge descriptors. We also\ndemonstrate the important role of charge screening effects in obtaining correct\nsize extensivity in electrostatic properties. Analyzing the spatial symmetries\nof these properties allows us to shed light on the role of charge conservation\nin the electronegativity equalization process.

The existence of\ngalaxy clusters and super-clusters suggests that a natural scale for the matter\ndistribution may not exist. A point of controversy is whether the distribution\nis fractal and, if so, over what range of scales. One-dimensional models\ndemonstrate that the important dynamics for cluster formation occur in the\nposition-velocity plane. Here the development of scaling behavior and\nmultifractal geometry is investigated for a family of one-dimensional models\nfor three different, scale-free, initial conditions. The methodology employed\nincludes: 1) The derivation of explicit solutions for the gravitational\npotential and field for a one-dimensional system with periodic boundary\nconditions (Ewald sums for one dimension); 2) The development of a procedure\nfor obtaining scale-free initial conditions for the growing mode in phase space\nfor an arbitrary power-law index; 3) The evaluation of power spectra,\ncorrelation functions, and generalized fractal dimensions at different stages\nof the system evolution. It is shown that a simple analytic representation of\nthe power spectra captures the main features of the evolution, including the\ncorrect time dependence of the crossover from the linear to nonlinear regime\nand the transition from regular to fractal geometry. A possible physical\nmechanism for understanding the self-similar evolution is introduced. It is\nshown that hierarchical cluster formation depends both on the model and the\ninitial power spectrum. Under special circumstances a simple relation between\nthe power spectrum, correlation function, and correlation dimension in the\nhighly nonlinear regime is confirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 20:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 20:33:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 03:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For most objects, velocity dispersions were\nmeasured from high S/N ratio optical spectra centered on the Ca II triplet\nregion (~8500 A), obtained at the Keck, Palomar, and Lick Observatories. For\ntwo objects, in which the Ca II triplet region was contaminated by nuclear\nemission, the measurement was based on high-quality H-band spectra obtained\nwith the OSIRIS at the Keck-II Telescope. Combining our new measurements with\ndata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies with\nstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based MBH measurements in the\nrange of black hole mass 10^6<MBH/M_sun<10^9. We use this sample to obtain\nreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of the\nM-sigma relation of active galaxies. Assuming a constant virial coefficient f\nfor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60\nand the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log\n(MBH/M_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those found\nfor quiescent galaxies. We derive an updated value of the virial coefficient f\nby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreement\nwith the M-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent M-sigma\nrelation determined by Gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with an\nintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. The uncertainty of the virial coefficient\nremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole mass\ndeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epoch\nspectroscopic estimates of MBH in active galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 23:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 09:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Mitola's work in 1992, Software Defined Radios (SDRs) have been\nquite a hot topic in wireless systems research. Though many notable\nachievements were reported in the field, the scarcity of computational power on\ngeneral purpose CPUs has always constrained their wide adoption in production\nenvironments. If conveniently applied within an SDR context, classical concepts\nknown in computer science as space/time tradeoffs can be extremely helpful when\ntrying to mitigate this problem. Inspired by and building on those concepts,\nthis paper presents a novel SDR implementation technique which we call Memory\nAcceleration (MA) that makes extensive use of the memory resources available on\na general purpose computing system, in order to accelerate signal computation.\nMA can provide substantial acceleration factors when applied to conventional\nSDRs without reducing their peculiar flexibility. As a practical proof of this,\nan example of MA applied in the real world to the ETSI DVB-T Viterbi decoder is\nprovided. Actually MA is shown able to provide, when applied to such Viterbi\ndecoder, an acceleration factor of 10.4x, with no impact on error correction\nperformances of the decoder and by making no use of any other typical\nperformance enhancement techniques such as low level (Assembler) programming or\nparallel computation, which though remain compatible with MA. Opportunity for\nextending the MA approach to the entire radio system, thus implementing what we\ncall a Memory-Based Software Defined Radio (MB-SDR) is finally considered and\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 00:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

While previous work in this area has\nconcentrated on radio frequency (RF) channels, providing security guarantees\nfor RF channels is inherently difficult because they are prone to rapid\nvariations due small scale fading. Wireless optical communication, on the other\nhand, is inherently more secure than RF communication due to the intrinsic\naspects of the signal propagation in the optical and near-optical frequency\nrange. In this paper, secure communication over wireless optical links is\nexamined by studying the secrecy capacity of a direct detection system. For the\ndegraded Poisson wiretap channel, a closed-form expression of the secrecy\ncapacity is given. A complete characterization of the general rate-equivocation\nregion is also presented. For achievability, an optimal code is explicitly\nconstructed by using the structured code designed by Wyner for the Poisson\nchannel.

The\nprimitive meteorite record suggests that sizeable planetesimals formed in the\nasteroid belt over a period longer than a million years, each composed entirely\nof an unusual, but homogeneous, mixture of mm-size particles. We sketch a\nscenario in which primary accretion of 10-100km size planetesimals proceeds\ndirectly, if sporadically, from aerodynamically-sorted mm-size particles\n(generically \"chondrules\"). These planetesimal sizes are in general agreement\nwith the currently observed asteroid mass peak near 100km diameter, which has\nbeen identified as a \"fossil\" property of the pre-erosion, pre-depletion\npopulation. We extend our primary accretion theory to make predictions for\nouter solar system planetesimals, which may also have a preferred size in the\n100km diameter range. We estimate formation rates of planetesimals and assess\nthe conditions needed to match estimates of both asteroid and Kuiper Belt\nObject (KBO) formation rates. For nebula parameters that satisfy observed mass\naccretion rates of Myr-old protoplanetary nebulae, the scenario is roughly\nconsistent with not only the \"fossil\" sizes of the asteroids, and their\nestimated production rates, but also with the observed spread in formation ages\nof chondrules in a given chondrite, and with a tolerably small radial diffusive\nmixing during this time between formation and accretion (the model naturally\nhelps explain the peculiar size distribution of chondrules within such\nobjects). The scenario also produces 10-100km diameter primary KBOs.

We find that one\nneeds to stay away from the sample boundaries by more than 30$h^{-1}$Mpc to\nreduce the error within 20% of the root mean square values of the potential or\nthe shear tensor. The error due to the galaxy biasing can be significantly\nreduced by using the galaxy mass density field instead of the galaxy number\ndensity field. The error caused by the redshift space distortion can be\neffectively removed by correcting galaxy positions for the peculiar velocity\neffects. We inspect the dependence of dark matter halo properties on four\nenvironmental parameters; local density, gravitational potential, and the\nellipticity and prolateness of the shear tensor. We find the local density has\nthe strongest correlation with halo properties. This is evidence that the\ninternal physical properties of dark halos are mainly controlled by small-scale\nphysics. In high density regions dark halos are on average more massive and\nspherical, and have higher spin parameter and velocity dispersion. In high\ndensity regions dark halos are on average more massive and spherical, and have\nhigher spin parameter and velocity dispersion. We also study the relation\nbetween the environmental parameters and the subtypes of dark halos. The spin\nparameter of satellite halos depends only weakly on the local density for all\nmass ranges studied while that of isloated or central halos depends more\nsensitively on the local density.

We found (1) MgII BAL is more\nfrequently detected in quasars with narrower Hbeta emission-line, weaker [OIII]\nemission-line, stronger optical FeII multiplets and higher luminosity. In term\nof fundamental physical parameters of a black hole accretion system, loBAL\nfraction is significantly higher in quasars with a higher Eddington ratio than\nthose with a lower Eddington ratio. The fraction is not dependent on the black\nhole mass in the range concerned. The overall fraction distribution is broad,\nsuggesting a large range of covering factor of the absorption material. (2)\n[OIII]-weak loBAL quasars averagely show undetected [NeV] emission line and a\nvery small line ratio of [NeV] to [OIII]. However, the line ratio in non-BAL\nquasars, which is much larger than that in [OIII]-weak loBAL quasars, is\nindependent of the strength of the [OIII] line. (3) loBAL and non-loBAL quasars\nhave similar colors in near-infrared to optical band but different colors in\nultraviolet. (4) Quasars with MgII absorption lines of intermediate width are\nindistinguishable from the non-loBAL quasars in optical emission line\nproperties but their colors are similar to loBAL quasars, redder than non-BAL\nquasars. We also discuss the implication of these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 07:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Among them a special role is played by the\nmicroRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor\nregulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this\npaper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version\nof this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an\nefficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall\ngene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream\nregulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is\nthat the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression\nof the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected\nfine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the\nactual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their\ntargets. Finally we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the\ncross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the\nmicroRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a\nlarger network of regulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 13:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 14:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Two special instances of this network are orthogonal broadcast relay\nchannel and the orthogonal multiple access relay channel. The focus is on\ncomplexity constrained scenarios, e.g., for wireless sensor networks, where\nchannel coding is practically imperfect. Taking a source-channel and network\ncoding approach, we design the network code (mapping) at the relay such that\nthe average reconstruction distortion at the destinations is minimized. To this\nend, by decomposing the distortion into its components, an efficient design\nalgorithm is proposed. The resulting network code is nonlinear and\nsubstantially outperforms the best performing linear network code.
