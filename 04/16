The sample represents the low-redshift AGN population over a wide range\nof luminosities, from Seyfert 1 galaxies to luminous quasars. From the\ndistribution of black hole masses we derived the active black hole mass\nfunction (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) in the\nlocal universe, exploiting the fact that the HES has a well-defined selection\nfunction. While the directly determined ERDF turns over around L/L_Edd ~ 0.1,\nsimilar to what has been seen in previous analyses, we argue that this is an\nartefact of the sample selection. We employed a maximum likelihood approach to\nestimate the intrinsic distribution functions of black hole masses and\nEddington ratios simultaneously in an unbiased way, taking the sample selection\nfunction fully into account. The resulting ERDF is well described by a\nSchechter function, with evidence for a steady increase towards lower Eddington\nratios, qualitatively similar to what has been found for type~2 AGN from the\nSDSS. Comparing our best-fit active BHMF with the mass function of inactive\nblack holes we obtained an estimate of the fraction of active black holes, i.e.\nan estimate of the AGN duty cycle. The active fraction decreases strongly with\nincreasing black hole mass. A comparison with the BHMF at higher redshifts also\nindicates that, at the high mass end, black holes are now in a less active\nstage than at earlier cosmic epochs. Our results support the notion of\nanti-hierarchical growth of black holes, and are consistent with a picture\nwhere the most massive black holes grew at early cosmic times, whereas at\npresent mainly smaller mass black holes accrete at a significant rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 17:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Despite having trivial thermodynamic properties,\ntheir dynamics slows down dramatically at low temperatures while displaying\ndynamical heterogeneity as seen in glass forming supercooled liquids. This\ndynamics has its origin in an ergodic-nonergodic first-order phase transition\nbetween phases of distinct dynamical \"activity\". This is a \"space-time\"\ntransition as it corresponds to a singular change in ensembles of trajectories\nof the dynamics rather than ensembles of configurations. Here we extend these\nideas to driven glassy systems by considering KCMs driven into non-equilibrium\nsteady states through non-conservative forces. By classifying trajectories\nthrough their entropy production we prove that driven KCMs also display an\nanalogous first-order space-time transition between dynamical phases of finite\nand vanishing entropy production. We also discuss how trajectories with rare\nvalues of entropy production can be realized as typical trajectories of a\nmapped system with modified forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 19:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-01"}

Testing this idea, we\ntentatively detect the 13CO J=3-2 line at a level of 0.3 Jy km/s toward the\nCloverleaf Quasar at redshift 2.5. This is the first observational evidence for\n13CO at high redshift. The 12CO/13CO J=3-2 luminosity ratio is with at least 40\nmuch higher than ratios observed in molecular clouds of the Milky Way and in\nthe ultraluminous galaxy Arp 220, but may be similar to that observed toward\nNGC 6240. Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) models simulating seven 12CO\ntransitions and the 13CO line yield 12CO/13CO abundance ratios in excess of 100\nfor the Cloverleaf. It is possible that the measured ratio is affected by a\nstrong submillimeter radiation field, which reduces the contrast between the\n13CO line and the background. It is more likely, however, that the ratio is\ncaused by a real deficiency of 13CO. A potential conflict with optical data,\nindicating high abundances also for secondary nuclei in quasars of high\nredshift, may be settled if the bulk of the CO emission is originating\nsufficiently far from the active galactic nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 19:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Various\nmodels have been suggested for the formation of the B-stars closest to the MBH\n(<0.05 pc; the S-stars), typically involving the migration of these stars from\ntheir original birthplace to their currently observed position. Here we explore\nthe orbital phase space distribution of the B-stars throughout the central pc\nexpected from the various suggested models for the origin of the B-stars.

The dominant differences in galaxy merger rates owe to\nbaryonic physics. Hydrodynamic simulations without feedback and older models\nthat do not agree with the observed galaxy mass function propagate factor ~5\nbias in the resulting merger rates. However, if the model matches the galaxy\nmass function, properties of central galaxies are sufficiently converged to\ngive small differences in merger rates. But variations in baryonic physics of\nsatellites also have dramatic effects. The known problem of satellite\n'over-quenching' in most semi-analytic models (SAMs), whereby SAM satellites\nare too efficiently stripped of gas, could lead to order-of-magnitude\nunder-estimates of merger rates for low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. Fixing the\nsatellite properties to observations tends to predict higher merger rates, but\nwith factor ~2 empirical uncertainties. Choice of mass ratio definition\nmatters: at low masses, most true major mergers (in baryonic/dynamical galaxy\nmass) will appear to be minor mergers in their stellar or luminosity mass\nratio.

Combining our sample with a further 9 PDLAs from the\nliterature we compare the chemical properties of the proximate systems with a\ncontrol sample of intervening DLAs. Taken at face value, the sample of 16 PDLAs\nexhibits a wide range of metallicities, ranging from Z ~ 1/3 Z_sun down to Z ~\n1/1000 Z_sun, including the DLA with the lowest N(SiII)/N(HI) yet reported in\nthe literature. We find several pieces of evidence that indicate enhanced\nionization and the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum in PDLAs which lead to\nproperties that contrast with the intervening DLAs, particularly when the N(HI)\nis low. The abundances of Zn, Si and S in PDLAs with log N(HI) > 21, where\nionization corrections are minimized, are systematically higher than the\nintervening population by a factor of around 3. We also find possible evidence\nfor a higher fraction of NV absorbers amongst the PDLAs, although the\nstatistics are still modest. 6/7 of our echelle sample show high ionization\nspecies (SiIV, CIV, OVI or NV) offset by >100 km/s from the main low ion\nabsorption. We analyse fine-structure transitions of CII* and SiII* to\nconstrain the PDLA distance from the QSO. Lower limits range from tens of kpc\nup to >160 kpc for the most stringent limit. We conclude that (at least some)\nPDLAs do exhibit different characteristics relative to the intervening\npopulation out to 3000 km/s (and possibly beyond). Nonetheless, the PDLAs\nappear distinct from lower column density associated systems and the inferred\nQSO-absorber separations mean they are unlikely to be associated with the QSO\nhost. We speculate that the PDLAs preferentially sample more massive galaxies\nin more highly clustered regions of the high redshift universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 21:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Determination of post-Keplerian parameters of\ndouble neutron star binaries (especially of the double pulsar) provide clean\ntests of GTR and in the future may lead us to constrain the dense matter EoS.\nFor binary pulsars with MS or WD companions, knowledge about the values of the\norbital parameters as well as of the spin periods and the masses of the pulsars\nand the companions might be useful to understand the evolutionary history of\nthe systems. As accreting neutron star binaries lead to orbit circularization\ndue to the tidal coupling during accretion, their descendants i.e. binary MSPs\nare expected to be in circular orbits. On the other hand, dense stellar\nenvironments inside globular clusters (GCs) cause different types of\ninteractions of single stars with pulsar binaries. These interactions can\nimpart high eccentricities to the pulsar binaries. So it is quite common to get\neccentric millisecond pulsar binaries in GCs and we find that \"fly-by\" causes\nintermediate values of eccentricities while \"exchange\" or \"merger\" causes high\nvalues of eccentricities. We also show that \"ionization\" is not much effective\nin the present stage of GCs.

We find correlations of roughly 0.35 to\n0.5 between SAT scores and upper division, in-major GPA (henceforth, GPA).\nInterestingly, low SAT scores do not preclude high performance in most majors.\nThat is, the distribution of SAT scores after conditioning on high GPA (e.g.,\n3.5 or even 4.0) typically extends below 1000 (the average among test takers).\nWe hypothesize that \"overachievers\" overcome cognitive deficits through hard\nwork, and discuss to what extent they can be identified from high school\nrecords. Only a few majors seem to exhibit a \"cognitive threshold\" -- such that\nhigh GPA (mastery of the subject matter) is very unlikely below a certain SAT\nthreshold (i.e., no matter how dedicated or hard working the student). Our\nresults suggest that almost any student admitted to university can achieve\nacademic success, if they work hard enough. In addition to our primary result,\nwe find that the best predictor of GPA is a roughly equally weighted sum of SAT\nand high school GPA, measured in standard deviation units. Using a\nsub-population of honors college students, we can estimate how students at\nelite universities would fare at a typical state university, allowing us to\ncomment on issues such as grade inflation. Finally, we observe that 1) SAT\nscores fluctuate little on retest (very high reliability), 2) SAT and GRE\nscores (where available) correlate at roughly 0.75 (consistent with the notion\nthat both tests measure a stable general cognitive ability) and 3) the SAT\ndistribution of students that obtained a degree does not differ substantially\nfrom that of the entering class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 23:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-19"}

Although the scale of a\nSTR as a main dissipation region is only several hundreds of thousands km,\nseveral interesting structures are found relating to generation of a root of\nthe energetic particles. The nonlinear evolution of plasma instabilities lead\nto a dynamical change in the ion phase space distribution which associates with\nchange of the field properties. As a result, different types of large-amplitude\nfield structures appear. One is the leading wave packet and another is a series\nof magnetic solitary humps. Each field structure has a microscopic scale (~ the\nion inertia length). Through the multiple nonlinear scattering between these\nlarge-amplitude field structures, electrons are accelerated directly. Within a\nSTR, quick thermalization realizes energy equipartition between the ion and\nelectron, hot electrons play an important role in keeping these large-amplitude\nfield structures on the ion-acoustic mode.

The \"shock system\", where fresh incoming and reflected ions are\nsupplied constantly, play an essential role in our result.

The\nsame analysis also shows that the stellar content of clusters and groups\ndisplays an intrinsic spread at a given cluster mass, i.e. clusters are not\nsimilar each other in the amount of stars they contain, not even at a fixed\ncluster mass. The stellar mass fraction depends on halo mass with (logarithmic)\nslope -0.55+/-0.08 and with 0.15+/-0.02 dex of intrinsic scatter at a fixed\ncluster mass. The intrinsic scatter at a fixed cluster mass we determine for\ngas mass fractions is smaller, 0.06+/-0.01 dex.

Our main finding is: A leader\nneuron sends a signal to many excitatory neurons as well as to a few inhibitory\nneurons and a leader neuron receives only a few signals from other excitatory\nneurons. Our linear analysis exhibits five essential properties for leader\nneurons with relative importance. This means that considering a given neural\nnetwork with a fixed mean number of connections per neuron, our analysis gives\nus a way of predicting which neuron can be a good leader neuron and which\ncannot. Our prediction formula gives us a good statistical prediction even if,\nconsidering a single given neuron, the success rate does not reach hundred\npercent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 08:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-19"}

In this\npaper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN\nlightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an\nexpanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core\ncollapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more. This reaffirms previous comparisons between pre-SN shells and\nshells produced by giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs), although\nthe physical mechanism responsible for these outbursts remains uncertain. The\nlightcurve shape and observed shell velocity can help diagnose the approximate\nsize and density of the circumstellar shell, and it may be possible to\ndistinguish between spherical and bipolar shells with multi-wavelength\nlightcurves. These models are merely illustrative. One can, of course, achieve\neven higher luminosities and longer duration light curves from interaction by\nincreasing the explosion energy and shell mass beyond values adopted here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 09:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 07:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 20:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-13"}

We have constructed the Killing potential, extension of the\npotential in the SO(2N)/U(N) coset space to that in the SO(2N+2)/U(N+1) coset\nspace. It is equivalent to the generalized density matrix whose diagonal-block\npart is related to a reduced scalar potential with a Fayet-Ilipoulos term.

The weak giant pulses are shown to\nform a separate part of the intensity distribution. The large number of giant\npulses detected were used to analyse scattering and scintillation in giant\npulses. We report for the first time the detection of giant pulse emission at\nboth the main- and interpulse phases within a single rotation period.

However, as is well known, the background need not be Minkowskian\nin several cases of physical interest. Thus, we here investigate in more detail\nwhat happens if the background space-time has a non-vanishing Riemann\ncurvature. In the case in which the de Donder gauge is imposed, its\npreservation under infinitesimal space-time diffeomorphisms is guaranteed if\nand only if the associated covector is ruled by a second-order hyperbolic\noperator. Moreover, since in this case the Ricci term of the wave equation has\nopposite sign with respect to the wave equation of Maxwell theory in the Lorenz\ngauge, it is possible to relate the solutions of the two problems.

It is known that checking diagnosability (i.e.,\nwhether a given observer is capable of identifying faults) can be solved in\npolynomial time for static observers, and we show that the same is true for\ndynamic ones.

Circadian rhythms thus\ncannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate,\nand consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a\npurely post-translational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling\ntime drops below the 24 hour clock period. At higher growth rates, a\ntranscription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust\ncircadian rhythms. Interestingly, while a transcription-translation cycle is\nnecessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a\nphosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a\ntranscription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. Our\nanalysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust\ncircadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 11:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-16"}

In our first\npaper (Crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure\n(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. Here, we\nstudy the CO depletion and N2H+ deuteration. We observed the millimeter lines\nof C18O, C17O, N2H+ and N2D+ toward the protostars using the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. Based on these observations, we derived the C18O, N2H+ and N2D+\nradial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfer\ncode. In addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. All\nthe C18O 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the C18O abundance decreases\ninwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the CO\nevaporation temperature, 20-25K, where the CO is released back to the gas\nphase. The N2H+ deuterium fractionation in Class 0 IMs is\n[N2D+]/[N2H+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental\n[D/H] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than in\npre-stellar clumps. Chemical models account for the C18O and N2H+ observations\nif we assume the CO abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in the\ninner envelope. This could be the consequence of the CO being converted into\nCH3OH on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or the\nphotodissociation of CO by the stellar UV radiation. The deuterium\nfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. This discrepancy is very likely\ncaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry and\nneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and UV\nradiation from the star. More important, the deuterium fractionation is\ndependent on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio, which is not likely to reach the\nsteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 11:42:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 12:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 11:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

All these sources were additionally\nmonitored simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously by the Fermi satellite in\ngamma-rays and the Swift UVOT in the UV and optical bands, respectively. We\nconstructed their broad-band spectra covering the frequency range from 10^14 Hz\nup to 10^25 Hz, and those reveal the nature of high-energy emission of luminous\nblazars in their low-activity states. The analyzed X-ray spectra are well\nfitted by a power-law model with photoelectric absorption. In the case of\nPKS0208-512, PKS1127-145, and 3C 454.3, the X-ray continuum showed indication\nof hard-ening at low-energies. Moreover, when compared with the previous X-ray\nobservations, we see a significantly increasing contribution of low-energy\nphotons to the total X-ray fluxes when the sources are getting fainter. The\nsame behavior can be noted in the Suzaku data alone. A likely explanation\ninvolves a variable, flat-spectrum component produced via inverse-Compton (IC)\nemission, plus an additional, possibly steady soft X-ray component prominent\nwhen the source gets fainter. This soft X-ray excess is represented either by a\nsteep powerlaw (photon indices Gamma ~ 3 - 5) or a blackbody-type emission with\ntemperatures kT ~ 0.1-0.2 keV.

Integral field spectroscopy observations of\nthe sample galaxies were carried out with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture\nSpectrophotometer (PMAS) at the 3.5 m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory. An\narea 16 arcsec x 16 arcsec in size was mapped with a spatial sampling of 1\narcsec x 1 arcsec. We obtained data in the 3590-6996 Angstroms spectral range,\nwith a linear dispersion of 3.2 Angstroms per pixel. From these data we built\ntwo-dimensional maps of the flux of the most prominent emission lines, of two\ncontinuum bands, of the most relevant line ratios, and of the gas velocity\nfield. Integrated spectra of the most prominent star-forming regions and of\nwhole objects within the FOV were used to derive their physical parameters and\nthe gas metal abundances. Six galaxies display the same morphology both in\nemission line and in continuum maps; only in two objects, Mrk 32 and Tololo\n1434+032, the distributions of the ionized gas and of the stars differ\nconsiderably. In general the different excitation maps for a same object\ndisplay the same pattern and trace the star-forming regions, as expected for\nobjects ionized by hot stars; only the outer regions of Mrk 32, I Zw 123 and I\nZw 159 display higher [SII]/Halpha values, suggestive of shocks. Six galaxies\ndisplay an inhomogeneous dust distribution.

Numerous observations of Herbig\nAe/Be stars (HAeBes) have been performed, but only 2 detections of mid-IR H2\ntoward HD97048 and AB Aur have been reported. We aim at tracing the warm gas in\nthe disks of 5 HAeBes with gas-rich environments and physical characteristics\nclose to those of AB Aur and HD97048, to discuss whether the detections toward\nthese 2 objects are suggestive of peculiar conditions for the gas. We search\nfor the H2 S(1) emission line at 17.035 \\mu\\m with VISIR, and complemented by\nCH molecule observations with UVES. We gather the H2 measurements from the\nliterature to put the new results in context and search for a correlation with\nsome disk properties. None of the 5 VISIR targets shows evidence for H2\nemission. From the 3sigma upper limits on the integrated line fluxes we\nconstrain the amount of optically thin warm gas to be less than 1.4 M_Jup in\nthe disk surface layers. There are now 20 HAeBes observed with VISIR and TEXES\ninstruments to search for warm H2, but only two detections (HD97048 and AB Aur)\nwere made so far. We find that the two stars with detected warm H2 show at the\nsame time high 30/13 \\mu\\m flux ratios and large PAH line fluxes at 8.6 and\n11.3 \\mu\\m compared to the bulk of observed HAeBes and have emission CO lines\ndetected at 4.7 \\mu\\m.

The CH to H2 abundance ratios that this would\nimply if it were to arise from the same component as well as the radial\nvelocity of the CH lines both suggest that CH arises from a surrounding\nenvelope, while the detected H2 would reside in the disk. The two detections of\nthe S(1) line in the disks of HD97048 and AB Aur suggest either peculiar\nphysical conditions or a particular stage of evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 15:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
