In this model, multiple interfering clusters of\nusers communicate simultaneously, where the users within the same cluster wish\nto exchange messages among themselves. It is assumed that the users cannot\nreceive each other's signals directly, and hence the relay terminal in this\nmodel is the enabler of communication. In particular, restricted encoders,\nwhich ignore the received channel output and use only the corresponding\nmessages for generating the channel input, are considered. Achievable rate\nregions and an outer bound are characterized for the Gaussian mRC, and their\ncomparison is presented in terms of exchange rates in a symmetric Gaussian\nnetwork scenario. It is shown that the compress-and-forward (CF) protocol\nachieves exchange rates within a constant bit offset of the exchange capacity\nindependent of the power constraints of the terminals in the network. A finite\nbit gap between the exchange rates achieved by the CF and the\namplify-and-forward (AF) protocols is also shown. The two special cases of the\nmRC, the full data exchange model, in which every user wants to receive\nmessages of all other users, and the pairwise data exchange model which\nconsists of multiple two-way relay channels, are investigated in detail. In\nparticular for the pairwise data exchange model, in addition to the proposed\nrandom coding based achievable schemes, a nested lattice coding based scheme is\nalso presented and is shown to achieve exchange rates within a constant bit gap\nof the exchange capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 16:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 14:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

A prominent example is electromagnetically induced transparency\n(EIT) where the transmission of a probe beam through an optically dense medium\nis manipulated by means of a control beam. Scaling such experiments into the\nquantum domain with one, or just a few particles of both light and matter will\nallow for the implementation of quantum computing protocols with atoms and\nphotons or the realisation of strongly interacting photon gases exhibiting\nquantum phase transitions of light. Reaching these aims is challenging and\nrequires an enhanced matter-light interaction as provided by cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). Here we demonstrate EIT with a single atom\nquasi-permanently trapped inside a high-finesse optical cavity. The atom acts\nas a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control the\ntransmission of light through the cavity. We furthermore investigate the\nscaling of EIT when the atom number is increased one by one. The measured\nspectra are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model. Merging EIT with\ncavity QED and single quanta of matter is likely to become the cornerstone for\nnovel applications, e.g. the dynamic control of the photon statistics of\npropagating light fields or the engineering of Fock-state superpositions of\nflying light pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 16:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

Consequently, this source\nhas an extremely low bolometric luminosity (< 0.1 L_sun).

Results: This is the first work to report accurate\nmeasurements of the \"relative\" proper motions of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers. The\ndifferent spatial and 3-D velocity distribution clearly indicate that the 22\nGHz water and 6.7 GHz methanol masers are tracing different kinematic\nenvironments. The bipolar distribution of 6.7 GHz maser l.o.s. velocities and\nthe regular pattern of observed proper motions suggest that these masers are\ntracing rotation around a central mass of about 35 solar masses. The flattened\nspatial distribution of the 6.7 GHz masers, oriented NW-SE, suggests that they\ncan originate in a disk/toroid rotating around the massive YSO which drives the\n12CO(2-1) outflow, oriented NE-SW, observed on arcsec scale. The extended,\nradio continuum source observed close to the 6.7 GHz masers could be excited by\na wide-angle wind emitted from the YSO associated with the methanol masers, and\nsuch a wind is proven to be sufficiently energetic to drive the NE-SW 12CO(2-1)\noutflow.

Related to this, what is the effective theory that\ndescribes the universe on large scales? In this paper we make progress in\naddressing these questions. We show that the effective theory for the\nlong-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid coupled to gravity:\nintegrating out short-wavelength perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous\nbackground and introduces dissipative dynamics into the evolution of\nlong-wavelength perturbations. The effective fluid has small perturbations and\nis characterized by a few parameters like an equation of state, a sound speed\nand a viscosity parameter. These parameters can be matched to numerical\nsimulations or fitted from observations. We find that the backreaction of\nsmall-scale non-linearities is very small, being suppressed by the large\nhierarchy between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon scale. The\neffective pressure of the fluid is always positive and much too small to\nsignificantly affect the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that\nvirialized scales decouple completely from the large-scale dynamics, at all\norders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our effective theory be\nused to formulate a well-defined and controlled alternative to conventional\nperturbation theory, and we discuss possible observational applications.\nFinally, our way of reformulating results in second-order perturbation theory\nin terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid provides the opportunity to\nunderstand non-linear effects in a simple and physically intuitive way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The signals are typically characterized by a specific number of\nhard jets, leptons, or photons, while the backgrounds often have additional\njets. In such cases vetoing undesired additional jets is an effective way to\ndiscriminate signals and background. Given an inclusive event sample with N or\nmore jets, the veto to have only N energetic jets defines an \"exclusive\" N-jet\ncross section. This strongly restricts the phase space of the underlying\ninclusive N-jet cross section and causes large double logarithms in\nperturbation theory that must be summed to obtain theory predictions. Jet\nvetoes are typically implemented using jet algorithms. This yields complicated\nphase-space restrictions and one often relies on parton-shower Monte Carlos,\nwhich are limited to leading-logarithmic accuracy. We introduce a global event\nshape \"N-jettiness\", tau_N, which is defined for events with N signal jets and\nvanishes in the limit of exactly N infinitely narrow jets.

Unfortunately the large\nGunn-Peterson optical depth of the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium\n(IGM) is thought to render this line extremely difficult to detect prior to\nreionization. In this paper we demonstrate that the radiative transfer effects\nin the interstellar medium (ISM), which cause Lya flux to emerge from galaxies\nat frequencies where the Gunn-Peterson optical depth is reduced, can\nsubstantially enhance the prospects for detection of the Lya line at high\nredshift. In particular, scattering off outflows of interstellar HI gas can\nmodify the Lya spectral line shape such that >5% of the emitted Lya radiation\nis transmitted directly to the observer, even through a fully neutral IGM. It\nmay therefore be possible to directly observe `strong' Lya emission lines (EW >\n50 Angstrom rest frame) from the highest redshift galaxies that reside in the\nsmallest HII `bubbles' early in the reionization era with JWST. In addition, we\nshow that outflows can boost the fraction of Lya radiation that is transmitted\nthrough the IGM during the latter stages of reionization, and even\npost-reionization. Coupled with the fact that the first generation of galaxies\nare thought to have very large intrinsic equivalent Lya equivalent widths, our\nresults suggest that the search for galaxies in their redshifted Lya emission\nline can be competitive with the drop-out technique out to the highest\nredshifts that can be probed in the JWST era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Depending upon\nthe characteristic masses of the lenses, the observed ratio of the mean\ntangential shears may be consistent with an isotropic signal (despite the fact\nthat the lenses are non-spherical), or it may even be reversed from the\nexpected signal (i.e., the mean tangential shear for sources close to the\nobserved minor axes of the lenses may exceed the mean tangential shear for\nsources close to the observed major axes of the lenses). These effects are\ncaused primarily by the fact that the lens galaxies have, themselves, been\nlensed and therefore the observed symmetry axes of the lenses differ from their\nintrinsic symmetry axes. The effects of lensing of the foreground galaxies on\nthe observed function g+/g- cannot be eliminated by the rejection of foreground\ngalaxies with small image ellipticities, nor by focusing the analysis on\nsources that are located very close to the observed symmetry axes of the\nforeground galaxies.

The first light, typically a UV or X-ray flash, is\nfollowed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiation\nthat leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. Motivated by recent detection of\nemission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock\nbreakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying\nspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal\nequilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We\nfind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)\nand possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation\nis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,\nbefore the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical\nphase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal\nequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its\ntemporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light\ncurves. Some examples are: (i) Red supergiant SNe have an early bright peak in\noptical and UV flux, less than an hour after breakout. It is followed by a\nminimum at the end of the planar phase (about 10 hr), before it peaks again\nonce the temperature drops to the observed frequency range. In contrast WRs\nshow only the latter peak in optical and UV. (ii) Bright X-ray flares are\nexpected from all core-collapse SNe types.

Scheduling, however, consumes energy (e.g.,\nfor making users' channel state information available to the scheduler). This\nextra usage of energy, which could potentially be used for data transmission,\ncan be very wasteful, especially if the number of users is large. In this\npaper, we answer the question of how much MUDiv is required for energy limited\nMU systems. Focusing on uplink MU wireless systems, we develop MU scheduling\nalgorithms which aim at maximizing the MUDiv gain. Toward this end, we\nintroduce a new realistic energy model which accounts for scheduling energy and\ndescribes the distribution of the total energy between scheduling and data\ntransmission stages. Using the fact that such energy distribution can be\ncontrolled by varying the number of active users, we optimize this number by\neither (i) minimizing the overall system bit error rate (BER) for a fixed total\nenergy of all users in the system or (ii) minimizing the total energy of all\nusers for fixed BER requirements.

In ARQ, however, only a few\nerroneous bits in a packet will cause the entire packet to be discarded at the\nreceiver. In this case, it's wasteful to retransmit the correct bit in the\nreceived packet. The partial packet recovery only retransmits the unreliable\ndecoded bits in order to increase the throughput of network. In addition, the\ncooperative transmission based on Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA)\ncan obtain diversity gains with multiple relays with different locations for\nmultiple sources simultaneously. By exploring the diversity from the channel\nbetween relay and destination, we propose a relay-assisted partial packet\nrecovery in CDMA wireless network to improve the performance of throughput. In\nthe proposed scheme, asynchronous IDMA iterative chip-by-chip multiuser\ndetection is utilized as a method of multiple partial recovery, which can be a\ncomplementarity in a current CDMA network. The confidence values' concept is\napplied to detect unreliable decoded bits. According to the result of\nunreliable decoded bits' position, we use a recursive algorithm based on cost\nevaluation to decide a feedback strategy. Then the feedback request with\nminimum cost can be obtained. The simulation results show that the performance\nof throughput can be significantly improved with our scheme, compared with\ntraditional ARQ scheme. The upper bound with our scheme is provided in our\nsimulation. Moreover, we show how relays' location affects the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 03:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-16"}

We also\nfind that the synthetic CMD constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5\ndex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported by\nobservations. The above results are at odds with recent spectroscopic\ninvestigations suggesting that Carina stars cover a broad range in metallicity\n(Delta [Fe/H]~1--2 dex). We present a new method to estimate the metallicity of\ncomplex stellar systems using the difference in color between the red clump and\nthe middle of the RR Lyrae instability strip. The observed colors of Carina's\nevolved stars indicate a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.70+-0.19 dex, which agrees\nquite well with spectroscopic measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 06:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This single discontinuity introduced\nby the budget constraint fundamentally changes the properties of equilibria: in\nthe assignment model without budget constraints, a competitive equilibrium\nalways exists, and corresponds exactly to a stable matching. With budgets, a\ncompetitive equilibrium need not always exist. In addition, there are now two\ndistinct notions of stability, depending on whether both or only one of the\nbuyer and seller can strictly benefit in a blocking pair, that no longer\ncoincide due to the budget-induced discontinuity. We define weak and strong\nstability for the assignment model with transferable utilities, and show that\ncompetitive equilibria correspond exactly to strongly stable matchings.\n  We consider the algorithmic question of efficiently computing competitive\nequilibria in an extension of the assignment model with budgets, where each\nbuyer specifies his preferences over items using utility functions $u_{ij}$,\nwhere $u_{ij}(p_j)$ is the utility of buyer $i$ for item $j$ when its price is\n$p_j$.

The Weibel instability is driven by a temperature\nanisotropy which is commonly modeled by a bi-axis distribution function, such\nas a bi-Maxwellian or a generalized bi-Kappa. Previous studies have been\nlimited to a bi-Kappa distribution and found a suppression of this instability\nin the presence of suprathermal tails. In the present paper it is shown that\nthe Weibel growth rate is rather more sensitive to the shape of the anisotropic\ndistribution function. In order to illustrate the distinguishing properties of\nthis instability a \\emph{product-bi-Kappa distribution} is introduced, with the\nadvantage that this distribution function enables the use of different values\nof the spectral index in the two directions, $\\kappa_{\\parallel} \\ne\n\\kappa_{\\perp}$. The growth rates and the instability threshold are derived and\ncontrasted with those for a simple bi-Kappa and a bi-Maxwellian. Thus, while\nthe maximum growth rates reached at the saturation are found to be higher, the\nthreshold is drastically reduced making the anisotropic product-bi-Kappa (with\nsmall kappas) highly susceptible to the Weibel instability. This effect could\nalso rise questions on the temperature or the temperature anisotropy that seems\nto be not an exclusive source of free energy for this instability, and\ndefinition of these notions for such Kappa distributions must probably be\nreconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 13:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The third\nscenario, for which we demonstrate approximate optimality of source-channel\nseparation, generalizes the second scenario by allowing each source to be\nreconstructed at multiple destinations with different distortions.

The maser spots show a spheroidal distribution both at 1612 and 1667\nMHz, while at 1665 MHz emission from the blue-shifted maser peak is\nconcentrated on the stellar position, and the red-shifted peak emission\nexhibits a filamentary structure oriented on a SE-NW axis. The linear\npolarisation in both main lines is rather faint, ranging from 9 to 20% at 1665\nMHz and from 0 to 30% at 1667 MHz. At 1612 MHz most maser spots exhibit a\nsimilar range of linear polarisation although those in the outermost parts of\nthe envelope reach values as high as 66%. This is particularly apparent in the\nsouthern part of the shell. The detailed distribution of the polarisation\nvectors could only be obtained at 1612 MHz. The polarisation vectors show a\nhighly structured distribution indicative of a poloidal magnetic field inclined\nby 40-60$^\\circ$ to the line of sight. The velocity distribution of the maser\nspots with respect to the radial distance is well explained by an isotropic\noutflow at constant velocity in the case of a prolate shaped spheroid envelope,\nalso tilted about 45-65$^\\circ$ to the line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 15:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\n$k \\cdot p$ theory has fruitfully served this role for the long time since its\ncreation. During last two decades several problems have been detected in\nconnection with the application of the $k \\cdot p$ approach to such\nnanostructures. These problems are closely related to the violation of the\nellipticity conditions for the underlying system, the fact that until recently\nhas been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that in many cases the models\nderived by a formal application of the Luttinger-Kohn theory fail to satisfy\nthe ellipticity requirements. The detailed analysis, presented here on an\nexample of the $6 \\times 6$ Hamiltonians, shows that this failure has a strong\nimpact on the physically important properties conventionally studied with these\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 22:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-26"}
