The results\npresented here update our Virgo measurements and confirm our previous results\nshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the GCLF and the absolute\nmagnitude of the parent galaxy.

By changing the precollapse magnetic fields and initial angular\nmomentum distributions parametrically, we compute twelve models. As for the\nmicrophysics, a realistic equation of state is employed and the neutrino\ncooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme.\n  With these computations, we find that the total GW amplitudes show a\nmonotonic increase after bounce for models with a strong precollapse magnetic\nfield ($10^{12}$G) also with a rapid rotation imposed.\n  We show that this trend stems both from the kinetic contribution of MHD\noutflows with large radial velocities and also from the magnetic contribution\ndominated by the toroidal magnetic fields that predominantly trigger MHD\nexplosions. For models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the total GW\namplitudes after bounce stay almost zero, because the contribution from the\nmagnetic fields cancels with the one from the hydrodynamic counterpart.\n  These features can be clearly understood with a careful analysis on the\nexplosion dynamics.

With its wide spectral\nbandpass, extending to GeV energies, Fermi is sensitive to GRBs with very large\nisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). Although rare, these events are\nparticularly important for testing GRB central-engine models. When combined\nwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are able\nto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburst\nmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of the\noutflows. In agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativistic\nenergy budget of at least one of these events (GRB 090926A) exceeds the\ncanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude.

We present a general optimal\nestimator for the connected part of the trispectrum, for which we derive a\nquadratic term to incorporate the effects of inhomogeneous noise and masking.\nWe describe a general algorithm for creating simulated maps with given\narbitrary (and independent) power spectra, bispectra and trispectra. We propose\na universal definition of the trispectrum parameter $T_{NL}$, so that the\nintegrated bispectrum on the observational domain can be consistently compared\nbetween theoretical models. We define a shape function for the primordial\ntrispectrum, together with a shape correlator and a useful parametrisation for\nvisualizing the trispectrum. We derive separable analytic CMB solutions in the\nlarge-angle limit for constant and local models. We present separable mode\ndecompositions which can be used to describe any primordial or CMB bispectra on\ntheir respective wavenumber or multipole domains. By extracting coefficients of\nthese separable basis functions from an observational map, we are able to\npresent an efficient estimator for any given theoretical model with a\nnonseparable trispectrum. The estimator has two manifestations, comparing the\ntheoretical and observed coefficients at either primordial or late times. These\nmode decomposition methods are numerically tractable with order $l^5$\noperations for the CMB estimator and approximately order $l^6$ for the general\nprimordial estimator (reducing to order $l^3$ in both cases for a special class\nof models). We also demonstrate how the trispectrum can be reconstructed from\nobservational maps using these methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 19:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 18:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 19:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We argue\nthat online experiments can be just as valid---both internally and\nexternally---as laboratory and field experiments, while requiring far less\nmoney and time to design and to conduct. In this paper, we first describe the\nbenefits of conducting experiments in online labor markets; we then use one\nsuch market to replicate three classic experiments and confirm their results.\nWe confirm that subjects (1) reverse decisions in response to how a\ndecision-problem is framed, (2) have pro-social preferences (value payoffs to\nothers positively), and (3) respond to priming by altering their choices. We\nalso conduct a labor supply field experiment in which we confirm that workers\nhave upward sloping labor supply curves. In addition to reporting these\nresults, we discuss the unique threats to validity in an online setting and\npropose methods for coping with these threats. We also discuss the external\nvalidity of results from online domains and explain why online results can have\nexternal validity equal to or even better than that of traditional methods,\ndepending on the research question. We conclude with our views on the potential\nrole that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then\nrecommend software development priorities and best practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 22:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}

Ever since the\ngroundbreaking experiments of Galileo some three centuries ago, the great\nsuccesses of physicists were largely due to the fact that they were able to\ndecompose complex phenomena into simpler ones. Remember that the first\nobservation of the effects of an electrical current was made by Alessandro\nVolta (1745-1827) on the leg of a frog! Clearly, to make sense this observation\nhad to be broken down into several separate effects. Nowadays, with computers\nbeing able to handle huge amounts of data and to simulate any stochastic\nprocess no matter how complicated, there is no longer any real need for such a\nsearch for simplicity. Why should one spend time and effort trying to break up\ncomplicated phenomena when it is possible to handle them globally? On this new\nroad there are several stumbling blocks, however. Do such global mathematical\ndescriptions lead to a real understanding? Do they produce building blocks\nwhich can be used elsewhere and thus make our knowledge and comprehension to\ngrow in a cumulative way? Should econophysics also adopt the \"globalized\"\nperspective that has been endorsed, developed and spread by the numerous\n\"Complexity Departments\" which sprang up during the last decade?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2010 16:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}
