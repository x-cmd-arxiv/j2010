We\nlinearise the dynamical equations of a Newtonian two-fluid model for rapidly\nrotating backgrounds. In the axisymmetric equilibrium configurations, the two\nfluid components corotate and are in beta-equilibrium. We use analytical\nequations of state that generate stratified and non-stratified stellar models,\nwhich enable us to study the coupling between the dynamical degrees of freedom\nof the system. By means of time evolutions of the linearised dynamical\nequations, we determine the spectrum of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric\noscillation modes, accounting for the contribution of the gravitational\npotential perturbations, i.e. without adopting the Cowling approximation. We\nstudy the mutual friction damping of the superfluid oscillations and consider\nthe effects of the non-dissipative part of the mutual friction force on the\nmode frequencies. We also provide technical details and relevant tests for the\nhydrodynamical model of pulsar glitches discussed by Sidery, Passamonti and\nAndersson (2010). In particular, we describe the method used to generate the\ninitial data that mimic the pre-glitch state, and derive the equations that are\nused to extract the gravitational-wave signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 16:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

There are two technologies for AON:\nWavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) and Optical Time Division Multiplexed\n(OTDM). OTDM transmission systems are becoming increasingly important as one of\nthe key technologies satisfying the growing demand for large capacity optical\nnetworks. Although OTDM has several advantages in terms of operation system,\nsuch as natural accommodation of higher bit rate payloads, it introduces many\nsecurity vulnerabilities, which do not exist in traditional networks. One of\nthe serious problems with OTDM is the fact that optical crosstalk is additive,\nand thus the aggregate effect of crosstalk over a whole all-optical network\n(AON) may be more nefarious than a single point of crosstalk. This is because\ncrosstalk can spread rapidly through the network, causing additional awkward\nfailures and triggering multiple undesirable alarms. This results in the\ncontinuous monitoring and identification of the impairments becoming\nchallenging in the event of transmission failures.

In this paper,\nthis process is investigated for the case when a linear feedback scheme is\nimplemented as an inner code and, in particular, over an additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channel with noisy feedback. To begin, we look to derive\nthe optimal linear feedback scheme by optimizing over the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio. From this optimization, an asymptotically optimal linear\nfeedback scheme is produced and compared to other well-known schemes. Then, the\nlinear feedback scheme is implemented as an inner code to a concatenated code\nover the AWGN channel with noisy feedback. This code shows improvements not\nonly in error exponent bounds, but also in bit-error-rate and frame-error-rate.\nIt is also shown that the if the concatenated code has total blocklength L and\nthe inner code has blocklength, N, the inner code blocklength should scale as N\n= O(C/R), where C is the capacity of the channel and R is the rate of the outer\ncode.

These conditions enabled the isolation of\nforcing by geomagnetic activity on the preconditioned solar minimum state of\nthe upper atmosphere caused by Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs).\nThermosphere density observations around 400 km from the CHAMP satellite are\nused to study the thermosphere density response to solar wind high - speed\nstreams/CIRs. Superposed epoch results show that thermosphere density responds\nto high - speed streams globally, and the density at 400 km changes by 75% on\naverage. The relative changes of neutral density are comparable at different\nlatitudes, although its variability is largest at high latitudes. In addition,\nthe response of thermosphere density to high - speed streams is larger at night\nthan in daytime, indicating the preconditioning effect of the thermosphere\nresponse to storms.

Aims: We study the chemical composition of red giant stars in\nPal 4 - one of the most remote GCs in the Milky Way - and compare our abundance\nmeasurements to those for both low surface brightness dwarf galaxies, and GCs\nin the inner and the outer halo. Methods: By co-adding high-resolution, low-S/N\nKeck/HIRES spectra of 19 stars along the red giant branch, we estimate chemical\nabundance ratios of 20 alpha-, iron peak-, and neutron-capture elements. Our\nmethod gives total uncertainties on most element-to-iron ratios of typically\n0.2 dex. Results: We measure [Fe/H] = -1.41 +- 0.04 (statistical) +- 0.17\n(systematic) and an alpha-enhancement of [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +- 0.11 dex, which\nis consistent with the canonical value of +0.4 dex found for Galactic halo\nfield stars and most halo GCs at this metallicity. Although Pal 4 has higher\nenhancements in the heavier elements with respect to the halo, the majority of\nthe element ratios are, within the measurement errors, consistent with those\nfor local halo field stars. We find, however, evidence for a lower [Mg/Ca]\nratio than in other halo clusters. Conclusions: Based on the available\nevidence, we conclude that the material from which Pal 4 and the Galactic halo\nformed experienced similar enrichment processes, despite the apparently younger\nage of this cluster. Within the limitations of our methodology we find no\nsignificant indication of an iron spread, as is typical of genuine GCs of the\nMilky Way.

We report on a spectroscopic determination of the atmospheric\nparameters and chemical abundances of the parent stars in transiting planets\nCoRoT-2b and CoRoT-4b. Adding data for CoRoT-3 and CoRoT-5 from the literature,\nwe find a flat distribution of the relative abundances as a function of their\ncondensation temperatures.

We elucidate\nunder which conditions a quasiblack hole can form under the presence of matter\nwith nonzero pressure. It is supposed that in the outer region an extremal\nquasihorizon forms, whereas inside, the quasihorizon can be either nonextremal\nor extremal. It is shown that in both cases, nonextremal or extremal inside, a\nwell-defined quasiblack hole always admits a continuous pressure at its own\nquasihorizon. Both the nonextremal and extremal cases inside can be divided\ninto two situations, one in which there is no electromagnetic field, and the\nother in which there is an electromagnetic field. The situation with no\nelectromagnetic field requires a negative matter pressure (tension) on the\nboundary. On the other hand, the situation with an electromagnetic field\ndemands zero matter pressure on the boundary. So in this situation an\nelectrified quasiblack hole can be obtained by the gradual compactification of\na relativistic star with the usual zero pressure boundary condition. For the\nnonextremal case inside the density necessarily acquires a jump on the\nboundary, a fact with no harmful consequences whatsoever, whereas for the\nextremal case the density is continuous at the boundary.

We find that the\nnon-Markovian reservoir has dual effects on the system: dissipation and\nbackaction. The dissipation exhausts the coherence of the quantum system,\nwhereas the backaction revives it. Moreover, we design the control Hamiltonian\nwith the control laws attained by the stochastic optimal control and the\ncorresponding optimal principle. At last, we considered the exact decoherence\ndynamics of a qubit in a dissipative reservoir composed of harmonic\noscillators, and demonstrated the effectiveness of our optimal control\nstrategy. Simulation results showed that the coherence will completely lost in\nthe absence of control neither in non-Markovian nor Markovian system.

More specifically, we address the issue of how\ndecoherence impacts the verification using N = 2 qubits entangled as Bell\nstates, as compared to N > 2 qubits entangled as GHZ states. We study the\noriginal quantum location verification protocol, as well as a variant protocol,\nintroduced here, which utilizes teleportation. We find that the performance of\nquantum location verification is in fact similar for Bell states and some N > 2\nGHZ states, even though quantum decoherence degrades larger-qubit entanglements\nfaster. Our results are important for the design and implementation of\nlocation-dependent communications in emerging quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 01:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

Finally, we briefly discuss future applications of the\npresent prescription for theoretical research on heavy lanthanide compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 04:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}

We\nshow that the main features of the filler dependencies of the nanocomposite\nconductivity can be reproduced without introducing any \\textit{a priori}\nimposed cut-off in the inter-particle conductances, as usually done in the\npercolation-like interpretation of these systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat our numerical results are fully reproduced by the critical path method,\nwhich is generalized here in order to include the particle filler shapes. By\nexploiting this method, we provide simple analytical formulas for the composite\nconductivity valid for many regimes of interest. The validity of our\nformulation is assessed by reinterpreting existing experimental results on\nnanotube, nanofiber, nanosheet and nanosphere composites and by extracting the\ncharacteristic tunneling decay length, which is found to be within the expected\nrange of its values. These results are concluded then to be not only useful for\nthe understanding of the intermediate regime but also for tailoring the\nelectrical properties of nanocomposites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 07:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The feedback between massive stars and the interstellar medium is\none of the most important processes in the evolution of dwarf galaxies. This\ninteraction results in numerous neutral and ionised gas structures that have\nbeen found both in the disc and in the halo of these galaxies. However, their\norigin and fate are still poorly understood. We here present new HI and optical\ndata of two nearby irregular dwarf galaxies: IC 4662 and NGC 5408. The HI line\ndata were obtained with the ATCA and are part of the Local Volume HI Survey.\nThey are complemented by optical images and spectroscopic data obtained with\nthe ESO NTT and the ESO 3.6m telescope. Our main aim is to study the kinematics\nof the neutral and ionised gas components in order to search for outflowing gas\nstructures and to make predictions about their fate. We find the HI gas\nenvelopes of both galaxies to extend well beyond the optical discs. The optical\ndisc is embedded into the central HI maximum in both galaxies. However, higher\nresolution HI maps show that the HI intensity peaks are typically offset from\nthe prominent HII regions. While NGC 5408 shows a fairly regular HI velocity\nfield, which allows us to derive a rotation curve, IC 4662 reveals a rather\ntwisted HI velocity field, possibly caused by a recent merger event. We detect\noutflows with velocities between 20 and 60 km/s in our Halpha spectra of both\ngalaxies, sometimes with HI counterparts of similar velocity. We suggest the\nexistence of expanding superbubbles, especially in NGC 5408. This is also\nsupported by the detection of FWHMs as high as 70 km/s in Halpha. In case of\nNGC 5408, we compare our results with the escape velocity of the galaxy, which\nshows that the measured expansion velocities are in all cases too low to allow\nthe gas to escape from the gravitational potential of NGC 5408. This result is\nconsistent with studies of other dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 10:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

A promising indoor\npositioning technique is radio-based location fingerprinting, having the major\nadvantage of exploiting already existing radio infrastructures, like IEEE\n802.11, which avoids extra deployment costs and effort. The research goal of\nthis thesis is to address the limitations of current indoor location\nfingerprinting systems. In particular the aim is to advance location\nfingerprinting techniques for the challenges of handling heterogeneous clients,\nscalability to many clients, and interference between communication and\npositioning. The wireless clients used for location fingerprinting are\nheterogeneous even when only considering clients for the same technology.\nHeterogeneity is a challenge for location fingerprinting because it severely\ndecreases the precision of location fingerprinting. To support many clients\nlocation fingerprinting has to address how to scale estimate calculation,\nmeasurement distribution, and distribution of position estimates. This is a\nchallenge because of the number of calculations involved and the frequency of\nmeasurements and position updates. Positioning using location fingerprinting\nrequires the measurement of, for instance, signal strength for nearby base\nstations. However, many wireless communication technologies block communication\nwhile collecting such measurements. This interference is a challenge because it\nis not desirable that positioning disables communication. An additional goal is\nto improve the conceptual foundation of location fingerprinting. A better\nfoundation will aid researchers to better survey and design location\nfingerprinting systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 10:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

However, the\nlack of suitable sensitive instrumentation in the X-ray energy band has been\nthe limiting factor for its development in the last three decades. Up to now,\npolarization measurements have been made exclusively with Bragg diffraction at\n45 degrees or Compton scattering at 90 degrees and the only unambiguous\ndetection of X-ray polarization has been obtained for one of the brightest\nobject in the X-ray sky, the Crab Nebula. Only recently, with the development\nof a new class of high sensitivity imaging detectors, the possibility to\nexploit the photoemission process to measure the photon polarization has become\na reality. We will report on the performance of an imaging X-ray polarimeter\nbased on photoelectric effect. The device derives the polarization information\nfrom the track of the photoelectrons imaged by a finely subdivided Gas Pixel\nDetector. It has a great sensitivity even with telescopes of modest area and\ncan perform simultaneously good imaging, moderate spectroscopy and high rate\ntiming.

However, mapping a whole network to\nidentify central individuals whom to monitor is typically very difficult. We\npropose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global\nnetwork structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected\nindividuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether\nsuch a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu\noutbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided\nbetween a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the\nprogression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.\n11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a\nwhole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16\nof the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the\npopulation as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional\ntime to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.\nMoreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,\npsychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 13:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}

In this\napproach, an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. The market is assumed\nto have access to \"partial\" information about future cash flows. Each cash flow\nis determined by a collection of independent market factors called X-factors.\nThe market filtration is generated by a set of information processes, each of\nwhich carries information about one of the X-factors, and eventually reveals\nthe X-factor. Each information process has two terms, one of which contains a\n\"signal\" about the associated X-factor, and the other of which represents\n\"market noise\". The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the\ndiscounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the\ninformation provided by the market. When the market noise is modelled by a\nBrownian bridge one is able to construct explicit formulae for asset prices, as\nwell as semi-analytic expressions for the prices and greeks of options and\nderivatives. In particular, option price data can be used to determine the\ninformation flow-rate parameters implicit in the definitions of the information\nprocesses. One consequence of the modelling framework is a specific scheme of\nstochastic volatility and correlation processes. Instead of imposing a\nvolatility and correlation model upon the dynamics of a set of assets, one is\nable to deduce the dynamics of the volatilities and correlations of the asset\nprice movements from more primitive assumptions involving the associated cash\nflows. The paper concludes with an examination of situations involving\nasymmetric information. We present a simple model for informed traders and show\nhow this can be used as a basis for so-called statistical arbitrage.

Data obtained with future high-contrast imaging\ninstruments optimized for giant planets direct detection are strongly limited\nby the speckle noise. Specific observing strategies and data analysis methods,\nsuch as angular and spectral differential imaging, are required to attenuate\nthe noise level and possibly detect the faint planet flux. Even though these\nmethods are very efficient at suppressing the speckles, the photometry of the\nfaint planets is dominated by the speckle residuals. The determination of the\neffective temperature and surface gravity of the detected planets from\nphotometric measurements in different bands is then limited by the photometric\nerror on the planet flux. In this work we investigate this photometric error\nand the consequences on the determination of the physical parameters of the\ndetected planets. We perform detailed end-to-end simulation with the CAOS-based\nSoftware Package for SPHERE to obtain realistic data representing typical\nobserving sequences in Y, J, H and Ks bands with a high contrast imager.

To gain the\npromised benefit, however, huge feedback overhead is in demand to gather the\nchannel information. In this paper, we analyze the impact of channel asymmetry,\nwhich is inherent in CoMP systems, on downlink BS cooperative transmission with\nlimited feedback. We analyze the per-user rate loss of a multi-user CoMP system\nled by quantization. Per-cell quantization of multicell channels is considered,\nwhich quantizes the local channel and cross channel separately and is more\nfeasible in practice. From both the analytical and simulation results, we\nprovide a whole picture on various critical factors that lead to the\nperformance loss. Specifically, we show that the per user rate loss led by\nlimited feedback depends on the location of its paired users, except for\nrelying on its own signal to noise ratio and the quantization errors as in\nsingle cell multi-user multiple antenna systems. This implies that the\nquantization accuracy required for local and cross channel of each user depends\non the locations of its own as well as its paired users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 14:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

In these lecture notes I (i)\nintroduce basic notions of the physics of correlated electronic systems, (ii)\ndiscuss the construction of mean-field theories by taking the limit of high\nlattice dimensions, (iii) explain the simplifications of the many-body\nperturbation theory in this limit which provide the basis for the formulation\nof a comprehensive mean-field theory for correlated fermions, the dynamical\nmean-field theory (DMFT), (v) derive the DMFT self-consistency equations, and\n(vi) apply the DMFT to investigate electronic correlations in models and\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 15:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 12:43:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 16:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Think of this\nmessage being displayed on your computer screen while you were driving \"there's\na possibility of collision with a car in the next few minutes if you go on\ndriving with this speed and direction\". Our research is intended towards\ndeveloping collision avoidance architecture for the latest Intelligent\nTransport System. The exchange of safety messages among vehicles and with\ninfrastructure devices poses major challenges. Specially, safety messages have\nto be adaptively distributed within a certain range of a basically unbounded\nsystem. These messages are to be well coordinated and processed via different\nalgorithms. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the ITWS (intelligent\ntransportation warning system), we have discussed the Assisted Global\nPositioning System(AGPS) system providing additional positioning information at\nvariable conditions.

Embedded videos\napplications in new generations of telecommunication devices need a processing\ncapacity that can not be achieved by the conventional processor, to work around\nthis problem the use of programmable technology has a lot of interest. First,\nField Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) present many performance benefits for\nreal-time image processing applications. The FPGA structure is able to exploit\nspatial and temporal parallelism. In this paper, we present a new method for\nimplementation of the Color Structure Descriptor (CSD) using the FPGA circuit.\nIn fact the (CSD) provides satisfactory image indexing and retrieval results\namong all colorbased descriptors in MPEG-7. But the real time implementation of\nthis descriptor is still having problems. In this paper we propose a method for\nadapting this descriptor for possible implementation under the constraints of\nthe video processing in real time.

Turbo code also consists of interleaver unit and its BER\nperformance also depends on interleaver size.
