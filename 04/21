Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of large-scale\nstructure and cosmology.

The dominant lensing-only contribution beyond the zero-order\napproximation is the reduced shear, which takes into account not only\nlensing-induced distortions but also isotropic magnification of galaxy images.\nThis involves an integral over the matter bispectrum. We provide a fast and\ngeneral way to calculate this correction term.\n  Methods. Using a model for the matter bispectrum, we fit elementary functions\nto the reduced-shear contribution and its derivatives with respect to\ncosmological parameters.

Sources that give rise to detectable bursts include the\nformation or coalescence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the periapsis\npassage of compact objects in highly elliptic or unbound orbits about a SMBH,\nor cusps on cosmic strings.

The physical nature of the strong photometric variability of T Tau\nSa, the more massive member of the Southern \"infrared companion\" to T Tau, has\nlong been debated. Intrinsic luminosity variations due to variable accretion\nwere originally proposed but later challenged in favor of apparent fluctuations\ndue to time-variable foreground extinction. In this paper we use the timescale\nof the variability as a diagnostic for the underlying physical mechanism.\nBecause the IR emission emerging from Sa is dominantly thermal emission from\ncircumstellar dust at <=1500K, we can derive a minimum size of the region\nresponsible for the time-variable emission. In the context of the variable\nforeground extinction scenario, this region must be (un-) covered within the\nvariability timescale, which implies a minimum velocity for the obscuring\nforeground material. If this velocity supercedes the local Kepler velocity we\ncan reject foreground extinction as a valid variability mechanism. The variable\naccretion scenario allows for shorter variability timescales since the\nvariations in luminosity occur on much smaller scales, essentially at the\nsurface of the star, and the disk surface can react almost instantly on the\nchanging irradiation with a higher or lower dust temperature and according\nbrightness. We have detected substantial variations at long wavelengths in T\nTau S: +26% within four days at 12.8 micron. We show that this short-term\nvariability cannot be due to variable extinction and instead must be due to\nvariable accretion. Using a radiative transfer model of the Sa disk we show\nthat variable accretion can in principle also account for the much larger\n(several magnitude) variations observed on timescales of several years. For the\nlong-term variability, however, also variable foreground extinction is a viable\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 16:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The mixture is described by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for the bosons, coupled to an equation for the\norder parameter of the Fermi superfluid, which is derived from the respective\ndensity functional in the unitarity limit (a similar model applies to the BCS\nregime too). Straightforward SSB in the degenerate Fermi gas loaded into a DWP\nis impossible, as it requires an attractive self-interaction, while the\nintrinsic nonlinearity in the Fermi gas is repulsive. Nonetheless, we\ndemonstrate that the symmetry breaking is possible in the mixture with\nattraction between fermions and bosons, like 40K and 87Rb. Numerical results\nare represented by dependencies of asymmetry parameters for both components on\nparticle numbers of the mixture, N_F and N_B, and by phase diagrams in the\n(N_F,N_B) plane, which displays regions of symmetric and asymmetric ground\nstates. The dynamical picture of the SSB, induced by a gradual transformation\nof the single-well potential into the DWP, is reported too. An analytical\napproximation is proposed for the case when GPE for the boson wave function may\nbe treated by means of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. Under a special\nlinear relation between N_F and N_B, the TF approximation allows us to reduce\nthe model to a single equation for the fermionic function, which includes\ncompeting repulsive and attractive nonlinear terms. The latter one directly\ndisplays the mechanism of the generation of the effective attraction in the\nFermi superfluid, mediated by the bosonic component of the mixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 18:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

While different aspects of consensus\nalgorithms over random switching networks have been widely studied, a complete\ncharacterization of the distribution of the asymptotic value for general\n\\textit{asymmetric} random consensus algorithms remains an open problem. In\nthis paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and an upper bound\nfor the variance of the asymptotic consensus value, when the underlying network\nevolves according to an i.i.d. \\textit{directed} random graph process. We also\nprovide numerical simulations that illustrate our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 18:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-21"}

Results are presented on the phi invariant yield and the\nnuclear modification factor R_AA for Au+Au and Cu+Cu, and R_dA for d+Au\ncollisions, studied as a function of transverse momentum (1<p_T<7 GeV/c) and\ncentrality. In central and mid-central Au+Au collisions, the R_AA of phi\nexhibits a suppression relative to expectations from binary scaled p+p results.\nThe amount of suppression is smaller than that of the neutral pion and the eta\nmeson in the intermediate p_T range (2--5 GeV/c); whereas at higher p_T the\nphi, pi^0, and eta show similar suppression. The baryon (protons and\nanti-protons) excess observed in central Au+Au collisions at intermediate p_T\nis not observed for the phi meson despite the similar mass of the proton and\nthe phi. This suggests that the excess is linked to the number of constituent\nquarks rather than the hadron mass. The difference gradually disappears with\ndecreasing centrality and for peripheral collisions the R_AA values for both\nparticles are consistent with binary scaling.

Using N-body simulations we identify dark matter\nhalos over a broad mass range. We compute the power spectra and correlation\nfunctions for the halos and then examine how well the redshift distortion\nparameter beta=f/b can be reconstructed as a function of halo mass. We find\nthat beta measured for a fixed halo mass is generally a function of scale even\non large scales, in contrast with the common expectation that beta approaches a\nconstant described by Kaiser's formula on such scales. The scale dependence\ndepends on the halo mass, being stronger for smaller halos. It also cannot be\neasily explained with the well-known distribution function of the halo peculiar\nvelocities. We demonstrate that the biasing for smaller halos has larger\nnonlinearity and stochasticity, thus the linear bias assumption becomes worse\nfor smaller halos.

Luminous red galaxies\n(LRG), targeted by the SDSS-III's BOSS survey, tend to reside in very massive\nhalos.

We\ndiscuss the observational consequences of these axions on astrophysical black\nholes through the Penrose superradiance process. When an axion Compton\nwavelength is comparable to the size of a black hole, the axion binds to the\nblack hole \"nucleus\" forming a gravitational atom in the sky. The occupation\nnumber of superradiant atomic levels, fed by the energy and angular momentum of\nthe black hole, grows exponentially. The black hole spins down and an axion\nBose-Einstein condensate cloud forms around it. When the attractive axion\nself-interactions become stronger than the gravitational binding energy, the\naxion cloud collapses, a phenomenon known in condensed matter physics as\n\"Bosenova\". The existence of axions is first diagnosed by gaps in the mass vs\nspin plot of astrophysical black holes. For young black holes the allowed\nvalues of spin are quantized, giving rise to \"Regge trajectories\" inside the\ngap region. The axion cloud can also be observed directly either through\nprecision mapping of the near horizon geometry or through gravitational waves\ncoming from the Bosenova explosion, as well as axion transitions and\nannihilations in the gravitational atom. Our estimates suggest that these\nsignals are detectable in upcoming experiments, such as Advanced LIGO, AGIS,\nand LISA.

Lensing introduces magnification with a probability\ndistribution function (PDF) whose shape is highly skewed and depends on\ncosmological parameters. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to generate mock\nsamples of standard sirens, including a small intrinsic scatter, as well as the\nadditional, larger scatter from lensing, in their inferred distances. We derive\nconstraints on cosmological parameters, by simultaneously fitting the mean and\nthe distribution of the residuals on the distance vs redshift (d_L - z) Hubble\ndiagram. We find that for standard sirens at redshift z ~ 1, the sensitivity to\na single cosmological parameter, such as the matter density Omega_m, or the\ndark energy equation of state w, is ~ 50%-80% tighter when the skewed lensing\nPDF is used, compared to the sensitivity derived from a Gaussian PDF with the\nsame variance. When these two parameters are constrained simultaneously, the\nskewness yields a further enhanced improvement (by ~ 120%), owing to the\ncorrelation between the parameters. The sensitivity to the amplitude of the\nmatter power spectrum, sigma_8 from the cosmological dependence of the PDF\nalone, however, is ~ 20% worse than that from the Gaussian PDF. At higher\nredshifts, the PDF resembles a Gaussian more closely, and the effects of the\nskewness become less prominent.

This physical\nmechanism naturally leads to a nonlinear formulation, reproducing the observed\nlight curves of many pulsating white dwarfs. This numerical model can also\nprovide information on the average depth of a star's convection zone and the\ninclination angle of its pulsation axis. In this paper, we give two sets of\nresults of nonlinear light curve fits to data on the DBV GD 358. Our first fit\nis based on data gathered in 2006 by the Whole Earth Telescope (WET); this data\nset was multiperiodic, containing at least 12 individual modes. Our second fit\nutilizes data obtained in 1996, when GD 358 underwent a dramatic change in\nexcited frequencies accompanied by a rapid increase in fractional amplitude;\nduring this event it was essentially monoperiodic. We argue that GD 358's\nconvection zone was much thinner in 1996 than in 2006, and we interpret this as\na result of a short-lived increase in its surface temperature. In addition, we\nfind strong evidence of oblique pulsation using two sets of evenly split\ntriplets in the 2006 data. This marks the first time that oblique pulsation has\nbeen identified in a variable white dwarf star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 21:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This double-rendezvous\nmission is enabled by the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion. Dawn\nwill arrive at Vesta in 2011 and will operate in its vicinity for approximately\none year. Vesta's mass and non-spherical shape, coupled with its rotational\nperiod, presents very interesting challenges to a spacecraft that depends\nprincipally upon low-thrust propulsion for trajectory-changing maneuvers. The\ndetails of Vesta's high-order gravitational terms will not be determined until\nafter Dawn's arrival at Vesta, but it is clear that their effect on Dawn\noperations creates the most complex operational environment for a NASA mission\nto date. Gravitational perturbations give rise to oscillations in Dawn's\norbital radius, and it is found that trapping of the spacecraft is possible\nnear the 1:1 resonance between Dawn's orbital period and Vesta's rotational\nperiod, located approximately between 520 and 580 km orbital radius.This\nresonant trapping can be escaped by thrusting at the appropriate orbital phase.\nHaving passed through the 1:1 resonance, gravitational perturbations ultimately\nlimit the minimum radius for low-altitude operations to about 400 km,in order\nto safely prevent surface impact. The lowest practical orbit is desirable in\norder to maximize signal-to-noise and spatial resolution of the Gamma-Ray and\nNeutron Detector and to provide the highest spatial resolution observations by\nDawn's Framing Camera and Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer. Dawn dynamical\nbehavior is modeled in the context of a wide range of Vesta gravity models.\nMany of these models are distinguishable during Dawn's High Altitude Mapping\nOrbit and the remainder are resolved during Dawn's Low Altitude Mapping Orbit,\nproviding insight into Vesta's interior structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 02:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 20:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 May 2012 08:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A valuable clue may\nthe recent revelation that nuclear star clusters and massive black holes\nfrequently co-exist in intermediate mass bulges and elliptical galaxies. In an\neffort to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the disappearance\nof nuclear star clusters, we have numerically investigated the evolution of\nmerging star clusters with seed black holes. Using black holes that are 1-5% of\ntheir host nuclear cluster mass, we reveal how their binary coalescence during\na merger dynamically heats the newly wed star cluster, expanding it,\nsignificantly lowering its central stellar density, and thus making it\nsusceptible to tidal destruction during galaxy merging.

We show that\nthe opposite is true: creating a randomized truthful mechanism is essentially\nas easy as a single call to a monotone allocation rule. Our main result is a\ngeneral procedure to take a monotone allocation rule for a single-parameter\ndomain and transform it (via a black-box reduction) into a randomized mechanism\nthat is truthful in expectation and individually rational for every\nrealization. The mechanism implements the same outcome as the original\nallocation rule with probability arbitrarily close to 1, and requires\nevaluating that allocation rule only once. We also provide an extension of this\nresult to multi-parameter domains and cycle-monotone allocation rules, under\nmild star-convexity and non-negativity hypotheses on the type space and\nallocation rule, respectively.\n  Because our reduction is simple, versatile, and general, it has many\napplications to mechanism design problems in which re-evaluating the allocation\nrule is either burdensome or informationally impossible. Applying our result to\nthe multi-armed bandit problem, we obtain truthful randomized mechanisms whose\nregret matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors,\neven though prior work showed this is impossible for truthful deterministic\nmechanisms. We also present applications to offline mechanism design, showing\nthat randomization can circumvent a communication complexity lower bound for\ndeterministic payments computation, and that it can also be used to create\ntruthful shortest path auctions that approximate the welfare of the VCG\nallocation arbitrarily well, while having the same running time complexity as\nDijkstra's algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 06:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 23:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 21:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 18:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 19:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

The main property we analyze is the\ntime-dependent density. We also study is the exchange-correlation potential of\nTDDFT, obtained via reverse engineering from the time-dependent density. Our\nsystems consist of small, strongly correlated clusters, described by a Hubbard\nHamiltonian within the Hartree-Fock, second Born, GW and T-matrix\napproximations. We compare the results from the KBE dynamics to those from\nexact numerical solutions. The outcome of our comparisons is that, among the\nmany-body schemes considered, the T-matrix approximation is overall superior at\nall electron densities. Such comparisons permit a general assessment of the\nwhole idea of applying MBPT, in the KBE sense, to finite systems. A striking\noutcome of our analysis is that when the system evolves under a strong external\nfield, the KBE develop a steady-state solution as a consequence of a\ncorrelation-induced damping. This damping is present both in isolated (finite)\nsystems, where it is purely artificial, as well as in clusters contacted to\n(infinite) macroscopic leads. To illustrate this point we present selected\nresults for a system coupled to contacts within the T-matrix and second Born\napproximation. The extensive characterization we performed indicates that this\nbehavior is present whenever approximate self energies, based upon infinite\npartial summations, are used. A second important result is that, for isolated\nclusters, the steady state reached is not unique but depends on how one\nswitches on the external field. This may also true for clusters connected to\nleads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 09:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

Substantial observational efforts have been\ndevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. the\ninitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.\nIn spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are still\nseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, their\nenergetics and the environment. Aim: Independently of specific gamma-ray burst\ntheoretical recipes, spectra in the GeV/TeV range are predicted to be\nremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and therefore\noffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background light\ndistribution. Furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-high\nenergies, i.e. at $\\sim 100$\\,GeV, would solve the ambiguity about the\nimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barely\ndistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. Methods: We used the results of\nthe MAGIC telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\\sim0.76$)\n\\object{GRB\\,080430} at energies above about 80\\,GeV, to evaluate the\nperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based GeV/TeV\ntelescopes.

Nonetheless, our observations show that Cherenkov\ntelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the GeV/TeV\nemission of GRBs at moderate redshift ($z \\lesssim 0.8$), provided the\nobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of their\nafterglow phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 10:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 14:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

The\nrelationship between path statistics and Quantum Mechanics (QM) leads to two\ncanonical ways of defining random walk on a graph, which have different\nstatistics and hence different entropies. Generic random walk (GRW) is in\ncorrespondence with the field-theoretical formalism, whereas maximal entropy\nrandom walk (MERW), introduced by us in a recent work, is motivated by the\nFeynman path-integral formulation of QM. GRW maximizes entropy locally\n(neighbors are chosen with equal probabilities), in contrast to MERW which does\nso globally (all paths of given length and endpoints are equally probable). The\nstationary distribution for MERW is given by the ground state of a\nquantum-mechanical problem where nodes whose degree is smaller than average act\nas repulsive impurities. We investigate static and dynamical properties GRW and\nMERW in a variety of examples in one and two dimensions. The most spectacular\ndifference arises in the case of weakly diluted lattices, where a particle\nperforming MERW gets eventually trapped in the largest nearly spherical region\nwhich is free of impurities. We put forward a quantitative explanation of this\nlocalization effect in terms of a classical Lifshitz phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 10:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-04"}

The\nphenomenological distinction between Class I and II methanol masers is based on\ntheir spatial association with objects such as jets, cores, and ultracompact\nHII regions, but is also believed to correspond to different pumping\nmechanisms: radiation for Class II masers, collisions for Class I masers. In\nthis work, we have surveyed a large sample of massive star forming regions -\n296 objects divided into two groups named 'High' and 'Low' according to their\n[25-12] and [60-12] IRAS colours - in Class I and II methanol masers. Previous\nstudies indicate that the High sources are likely more evolved. Therefore, the\nsample can be used to assess the existence of a sequence for the occurrence of\nClass I and II methanol masers during the evolution of a massive star forming\nregion. We observed the 6 GHz (Class II) CH3OH maser with the Effelsberg 100-m\ntelescope, and the 44 GHz and 95 GHz (Class I) CH3OH masers with the Nobeyama\n45-m telescope. We have detected: 55 sources in the Class II line (12 new\ndetections); 27 sources in the 44 GHz Class I line (17 new detections); 11\nsources in the 95 GHz Class I line (all except one are new detections). Our\nstatistical analysis shows that the ratio between the detection rates of Class\nII and Class I methanol masers is basically the same in High and Low sources.\nTherefore, both masers are equally associated with each evolutionary phase. In\ncontrast, all maser species have about 3 times higher detection rates in High\nthan in Low sources. This might indicate that the phenomena that originate all\nmasers become progressively more active with time, during the earliest\nevolutionary phases of a high-mass star forming region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 12:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This is in turn used to provide an upper bound on the number\nof successful transmissions that can occur per unit area, which is known as the\ntransmission capacity. The upper bound results from assuming independence among\nthe potential paths, and can be viewed as the maximum diversity case. A useful\naspect of the upper bound is its simple form for an arbitrary-sized network,\nwhich allows insights into how the number of hops and other network parameters\naffect spatial throughput in the non-asymptotic regime. The outage probability\nanalysis is then extended to account for retransmissions with a maximum number\nof allowed attempts.
