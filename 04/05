However, a separate HMM is necessary for each\nsingle AU and each AU combination. Since combinations of AU numbering in\nthousands, a more efficient method will be needed. In this paper an accurate\nreal-time sequence-based system for representation and recognition of facial\nAUs is presented.

In specific, the proposed model\nimplements the Physical Random Access Channel used in 3GPP network standards.\nFurthermore, the proposed model allows the differentiation of users based on\ntheir priorities. The quantitative results illustrate that, for example,\ncellular network operators can control the manner in which traffic is offloaded\nbetween neighboring cells by simply adjusting the length of the random access\nphase. Our analysis also allows for the quantitative determination of the\nblocking probability individual users will experience given a specific length\nof random access phase. Furthermore, we observe that the improvement in\nblocking probability per shared channel for load balanced users using DR$_{K}$\nis maximized at an intermediate number of shared channels, as opposed to the\nmaximum number of these shared resources. This occurs because a balance is\nachieved between the number of users requesting connections and those that are\nalready admitted to the network.

Herein, control strategies which enable the\nsuperposition in time and frequency of primary and secondary user transmissions\nare explored in contrast to more traditional sensing approaches which only\nallow the secondary user to transmit when the primary user is idle. In this\nwork, the optimal transmission policy for the secondary user when the primary\nuser adopts a retransmission based error control scheme is investigated. The\npolicy aims to maximize the secondary users' throughput, with a constraint on\nthe throughput loss and failure probability of the primary user. Due to the\nconstraint, the optimal policy is randomized, and determines how often the\nsecondary user transmits according to the retransmission state of the packet\nbeing served by the primary user. The resulting optimal strategy of the\nsecondary user is proven to have a unique structure. In particular, the optimal\nthroughput is achieved by the secondary user by concentrating its transmission,\nand thus its interference to the primary user, in the first transmissions of a\nprimary user packet. The rather simple framework considered in this paper\nhighlights two fundamental aspects of cognitive networks that have not been\ncovered so far: (i) the networking mechanisms implemented by the primary users\n(error control by means of retransmissions in the considered model) react to\nsecondary users' activity; (ii) if networking mechanisms are considered, then\ntheir state must be taken into account when optimizing secondary users'\nstrategy, i.e., a strategy based on a binary active/idle perception of the\nprimary users' state is suboptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2010 23:43:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2011 21:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2011 23:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

The extra-terms in the gravitational field equations with\ngeometry-matter coupling modify the equations of motion of test particles, and\ninduce a supplementary gravitational interaction. Starting from the variational\nprinciple describing the particle motion in the presence of the non-minimal\ncoupling, the expression of the tangential velocity of a test particle, moving\nin the vacuum on a stable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric geometry,\nis derived. The tangential velocity depends on the metric tensor components, as\nwell as of the coupling function between matter and geometry. The Doppler\nvelocity shifts are also obtained in terms of the coupling function. If the\ntangential velocity profile is known, the coupling term between matter and\ngeometry can be obtained explicitly in an analytical form. The functional form\nof this function is obtained in two cases, for a constant tangential velocity,\nand for an empirical velocity profile obtained from astronomical observations,\nrespectively. Therefore, these results open the possibility of directly testing\nthe modified gravity models with non-minimal coupling between matter and\ngeometry by using direct astronomical and astrophysical observations at the\ngalactic or extra-galactic scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 07:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

The present value of the cosmological constant is very small\ncompared to the Planck scale, because the present Universe is very old and thus\nis close to equilibrium. Momentum space topology determines the universality\nclasses of fermionic vacua. The Standard Model vacuum both in its massless and\nmassive states is topological medium. The vacuum in its massless state shares\nthe properties of superfluid 3He-A, which is topological superfluid. It belongs\nto the Fermi-point universality class, which has topologically protected\nfermionic quasiparticles. At low energy they behave as relativistic massless\nWeyl fermions. Gauge fields and gravity emerge together with Weyl fermions at\nlow energy. This allows us to treat the hierarchy problem in Standard Model:\nthe masses of elementary particles are very small compared to the Planck scale\nbecause the natural value of the quark and lepton masses is zero. The small\nnonzero masses appear in the infrared region, where the quantum vacuum acquires\nthe properties of another topological superfluid, 3He-B, and 3+1 topological\ninsulators.

Contrary to this, it was found a few years ago that\nopaque metal films perforated with a periodic array of sub wavelength holes\nexhibit large transmission at certain wavelengths.

Our sample is the largest\nsingle-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collection\nof core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosity\nrange (down to M_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (>20%) of\ndwarf (M_r >= -18 mag) hosts. We find more core-collapse SNe in dwarf galaxies\nthan expected and several interesting trends emerge. We use detailed\nsubclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe and find that all\nType I core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either SNe Ib or\nbroad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL), while \"normal\" SNe Ic dominate in giant\ngalaxies.

We\nhypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss is\nreduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as \"normal\" SNe Ic in\nmetal-rich galaxies to retain some He and H, exploding as Ib/IIb events.

Another way to exert\nresonant control is with a set of rf-coupled bound states, linked to the\ncolliding pair through the molecular interactions that give rise to\nmagnetically tunable Feshbach resonances.

By analyzing the\nrelative arrival times of radio pulses at several radio antennas in an air\nshower array, this relation may be employed to estimate the depth of maximum of\nan extensive air shower if its impact position is known, allowing an estimate\nfor the primary particle's species. Vice versa, the relation provides an\nestimate for the impact position of the shower's core if an external estimate\nof the depth of maximum is available. In realistic circumstances, the method\ndelivers reconstruction uncertainties down to 30 g/cm^2 when the distance to\nthe shower core does not exceed 7 km. The method requires that the arrival\ndirection is known with high precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 15:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We study a new class\nof models consisting of $U(1)^n$ hidden sector extensions of the MSSM that\nincludes several stable particles, both fermionic and bosonic, which can be\ninterpreted as constituents of dark matter. In one such class of models, dark\nmatter is made up of both a Majorana dark matter particle, i.e., a neutralino,\nand a Dirac fermion with the current relic density of dark matter as given by\nWMAP being composed of the relic density of the two species. These models can\nexplain the PAMELA positron data and are consistent with the anti-proton flux\ndata, as well as the photon data from FERMI-LAT. Further, it is shown that such\nmodels can also simultaneously produce spin independent cross sections which\ncan be probed in CDMS-II, XENON-100 and other ongoing dark matter experiments.\nThe implications of the models at the LHC and at the NLC are also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 15:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 04:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
