The role of such an environment can be taken by electromagnetic\nfluctuations or dipole excitations (electron-hole pairs). The environment, in\nits turn, relaxes the energy to the thermostat by means of phonon irradiation.\nWe derive the current-voltage characteristics for the arrays and demonstrate\nthat opening the energy gap in the spectrum of the environmental excitations\ncompletely suppresses the tunneling current.

The\nGinsburg Landau approach to inflation allows to take high benefit of the CMB\ndata. The fourth degree double well inflaton potential gives an excellent fit\nto the current CMB+LSS data. We evaluate the Planck precision to the recovery\nof cosmological parameters within a reasonable toy model for residuals of\nsystematic effects of instrumental and astrophysical origin based on publicly\navailable information.We use and test two relevant models: the LambdaCDMr\nmodel, i.e. the standard LambdaCDM model augmented by r, and the LambdaCDMrT\nmodel, where the scalar spectral index, n_s, and r are related through the\ntheoretical `banana-shaped' curve r = r(n_s) coming from the double-well\ninflaton potential. In the latter case, r = r(n_s) is imposed as a hard\nconstraint in the MCMC data analysis. We take into account the white noise\nsensitivity of Planck in the 70, 100 and 143 GHz channels as well as the\nresiduals from systematics errors and foregrounds. Foreground residuals turn to\naffect only the cosmological parameters sensitive to the B modes. The best\nvalue for r in the presence of residuals turns to be about r simeq 0.04 for\nboth the LambdaCDMr and the LambdaCDMrT models.

The large\ndynamic range of our calculations is necessary to resolve the neutral patches\nleft at the end of reionization within a representative volume; we find that\nsimulation volumes exceeding several hundred Mpc on a side are necessary in\norder to properly model reionization when the neutral fraction is ~0.01-0.3.\nOur results indicate a strong dependence of percolation morphology on a large\nand uncertain region of model parameter space.

Our results show that both the\natomic-to-molecular transition on small, ~10 pc scales and the\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation on ~kpc scales are sensititive to the\ndust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a\nfunction of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather\nsharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or\nincreasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas\nsurface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the\nKS relation at a given gas surface density, in less dusty and/or higher FUV\nflux environments. These trends should have a particularly strong effect on the\nevolution of low-mass, low surface brightness galaxies which typically have low\ndust content and anemic star formation, but are also likely to be important for\nevolution of the Milky Way-sized systems.

Methods: Given a set of volumetric images\nof a patient at N breathing phases as the training data, we perform deformable\nimage registration between a reference phase and the other N-1 phases,\nresulting in N-1 deformation vector fields (DVFs). These DVFs can be\nrepresented efficiently by a few eigenvectors and coefficients obtained from\nprincipal component analysis (PCA). By varying the PCA coefficients, we can\ngenerate new DVFs, which, when applied on the reference image, lead to new\nvolumetric images. We then can reconstruct a volumetric image from a single\nprojection image by optimizing the PCA coefficients such that its computed\nprojection matches the measured one. The 3D location of the tumor can be\nderived by applying the inverted DVF on its position in the reference image.\nOur algorithm was implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to achieve\nreal-time efficiency. We generated the training data using a realistic and\ndynamic mathematical phantom with 10 breathing phases.

We present an analysis of 55 new rotation\nperiods,using light curves derived from differential photometry, for solar type\nstars in M 34.

We describe a methodology for establishing the gyrochronology age for\nan ensemble of solar-type stars. Empirical relations between rotation period,\nphotometric colour and stellar age (gyrochronology) are used to determine the\nage of M 34. Based on its position in a colour-period diagram, each M 34 member\nis designated as being either a solid-body rotator (interface or I-star), a\ndifferentially rotating star (convective or C-star) or an object which is in\nsome transitory state in between the two (gap or g-star).

For each\ncluster member identified as an I-sequence object in the colour-period diagram,\nwe derive its individual gyrochronology age, where the mean gyro age of M 34 is\nfound to be 193 +/- 9 Myr, formally consistent (within the errors) with that\nderived using several distance-dependent, photometric isochrone methods (250\n+/- 67 Myr).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 03:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The derived typical CO2/H2O ice ratio of our samples (~0.36 +-\n0.09) is greater than that of Galactic massive YSOs (~0.17 +- 0.03), while the\nCO/H2O ice ratio is comparable. It is shown that the CO2 ice abundance does not\ncorrelate with the observed characteristics of YSOs; the strength of hydrogen\nrecombination line and the total luminosity. Likewise, clear no correlation is\nseen between the CO ice abundance and YSO characteristics, but it is suggested\nthat the CO ice abundance of luminous samples is significantly lower than in\nother samples.The systematic difference in the CO2 ice abundance around the\nLMC's massive YSOs, which was suggested by previous studies, is confirmed with\nthe new near-infrared data. We suggest that the strong ultraviolet radiation\nfield and/or the high dust temperature in the LMC are responsible for the\nobserved high abundance of the CO2 ice.

Such a black hole magnetosphere may be considered as a\nmodel for the central engine of active galactic nuclei, some compact X-ray\nsources and gamma-ray bursts. The energy sources of the emission from the\nmagnetosphere are the gravitational and electromagnetic energies of magnetized\naccreting matters and the rotational energy of a rotating black hole.

We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic\nhalo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of\nmodels, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both\nthe stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in\nthe earliest phases (Z <10^-8), stars with masses above 40 Msun only enrich the\ninterstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. We\npredict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when\nallowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical\nenrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the\nstochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can\nexplain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal\nvery-metal-poor stars. For chemical elements with stellar yields that depend\nstrongly on initial mass (and rotation) such as C, N, and neutron capture\nelements, within the range of massive stars, a large scatter is expected once\nthe stochastic enrichment of the early interstellar medium is taken into\naccount. We also find that stellar winds of fast rotators mixed with\ninterstellar medium gas are not enough to explain the large CNO enhancements\nfound in most of the carbon-enhanced very-metal-poor stars. In particular, this\nis the case of the most metal-poor star known to date, HE 1327-2326, for which\nour models predict lower N enhancements than observed when assuming a mixture\nof stellar winds and interstellar medium. We suggest that these carbon-enhanced\nvery metal-poor stars were formed from almost pure stellar wind material,\nwithout dilution with the pristine interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 09:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Channel flows correspond\nto certain axisymmetric linear MRI modes, and their preponderance follows from\nthe remarkable fact that they are approximate nonlinear solutions of the MHD\nequations in the limit of weak magnetic fields. We show in this paper,\nanalytically and with one-dimensional numerical simulations, that this property\nis also shared by certain axisymmetric MRI modes in vertically-stratified\nshearing boxes. These channel flows rapidly capture significant amounts of\nmagnetic and kinetic energy, and thus are vulnerable to secondary shear\ninstabilities. We examine these parasites in the vertically stratified context,\nand estimate the maximum amplitudes that channels attain before they are\ndestroyed. These estimates suggest that a dominant channel flow will usually\ndrive the disk's magnetic field to thermal strengths. The prominence of these\nflows and their destruction place enormous demands on simulations, but channels\nin their initial stages also offer a useful check on numerical codes. These\nbenchmarks are especially valuable given the increasing interest in the\nsaturation of the stratified MRI. Lastly we speculate on the potential\nconnection between 'run-away' channel flows and outburst behaviour in\nprotostellar and dwarf nova disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 11:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The scaling\nfunction of the critical Casimir force is calculated within mean field theory.\nWithin our approach, the scaling functions of the critical Casimir force and of\nthe order parameter profile for finite surface fields can be mapped by\nrescaling, except for a narrow crossover regime, onto the corresponding scaling\nfunction of the so-called normal fixed point of strong surface fields.

This shows that\nthe turbulent properties differ between clouds depending on their environment.\nHowever, no significant influence on the predominant mode of star formation\n(clustered or isolated) could be found. Furthermore, the fraction of the cloud\nactively involved in star formation is only governed by gravity, with the\ncolumn density and mass distributions not significantly altered by local\nfeedback processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 12:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

But both experiments are limited by source\nconfusion in the submillimeter. The high confusion noise in particular\nrestricts the study of the clustering properties of the sources that dominate\nthe cosmic infrared background. At these wavelengths, it is more appropriate to\nconsider the statistics of the unresolved component. In particular, high\nclustering will contribute in excess of Poisson noise in the power spectra of\nCIB anisotropies. These power spectra contain contributions from sources at all\nredshift. We show how the stacking technique can be used to separate the\ndifferent redshift contributions to the power spectra. We use simulations of\nCIB representative of realistic Spitzer, Herschel, Planck, and SCUBA-2\nobservations. We stack the 24um sources in longer wavelengths maps to measure\nmean colors per redshift and flux bins. The information retrieved on the mean\nspectral energy distribution obtained with the stacking technique is then used\nto clean the maps, in particular to remove the contribution of low-redshift\nundetected sources to the anisotropies. Using the stacking, we measure the mean\nflux of populations 4 to 6 times fainter than the total noise at 350um at\nredshifts z=1 and z=2, respectively, and as faint as 6 to 10 times fainter than\nthe total noise at 850um at the same redshifts. In the deep Spitzer fields, the\ndetected 24um sources up to z~2 contribute significantly to the submillimeter\nanisotropies. We show that the method provides excellent (using COSMOS 24um\ndata) to good (using SWIRE 24um data) removal of the z<2 (COSMOS) and z<1\n(SWIRE) anisotropies. Using this cleaning method, we then hope to have a set of\nlarge maps dominated by high redshift galaxies for galaxy evolution study\n(e.g., clustering, luminosity density).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 12:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Conformal maps of simply connected\ndomains naturally have the structure of an infinite-dimensional groupoid, which\ngeneralizes the finite-dimensional group of self-maps. We put a topological\nstructure on the space of conformal maps on simply connected domains, which\nmakes it into a topological groupoid. Further, we (almost) extend this to a\nlocal manifold structure based on the infinite-dimensional Frechet topological\nvector space of holomorphic functions on a given domain A. From this, we\ndevelop the notion of conformal A-differentiability at the identity. Our main\nconclusion is that quadratic differentials characterizing cotangent elements on\nthe local manifold enjoy properties similar to those of the holomorphic\nstress-energy tensor of CFT; these properties underpin the local symmetries of\nCFT. Applying the general formalism to CFT correlation functions, we show that\nthe stress-energy tensor is exactly such a quadratic differential.

The grains in the disc are\noriginally of the same size as interstellar dust. Models predict that these\ngrains will grow in size through coagulation. Observations of the silicate\nfeatures at micron wavelengths are consistent with growth to micron sizes\nwhereas the slope of the SED at longer wavelengths traces growth up to mm\nsizes. We here look for a correlation between these two grain growth\nindicators. A large sample of T-Tauri and Herbig-Ae/Be stars was observed with\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope at 5-13 micron; a subsample was observed at mm\nwavelengths. We complement this subsample with data from the literature to\nmaximise the overlap between micron and mm observations and search for\ncorrelations. Synthetic spectra are produced to determine which processes may\nproduce the dust evolution. Dust disc masses in the range <1 to 7 x 10^-4 MSun\nare obtained. Most sources have a mm spectral slope consistent with grain\ngrowth. There is a tentative correlation between the 10-micron silicate feature\nand the mm slope of the SED. The observed sources seem to be grouped per\nstar-forming region in the micron-vs-mm diagram. The modelling results show\nthat the 10-micron feature becomes flatter and subsequently the mm slope\nbecomes shallower. Grain size distributions shallower than that of the ISM\nand/or bright central stars are required to explain specific features. Settling\nof larger grains towards the disc midplane affects the 10-micron feature, but\nhardly the mm slope. The tentative correlation between the strength of the\n10-micron feature and the mm slope suggests that the inner and outer disc\nevolve simultaneously. Dust with a mass dominated by mm-sized grains is\nrequired to explain the shallowest mm slopes. Other processes besides grain\ngrowth may also be responsible for the removal of small grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 15:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
