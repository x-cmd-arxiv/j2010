There are simple solutions for\nthis (e.g. Halevi and Krawczyk (ACM TISSEC 1999) and its improvement by\nBoyarsky (CCS 1999)). In this paper, we consider a new threat to this type of\nprotocol: if a server's high entropic secret gets compromised (e.g., due to\ncryptanalysis, virus attack or a poor management), the adversary might {\\em\nquickly} break lots of passwords and cause uncountable damage. In this case,\none should not expect the protocol to be secure against an off-line dictionary\nattack since, otherwise, the protocol is in fact a secure password-only key\nexchange where the server also only has a password (by making the server high\nentropic secret public). Of course a password-only key exchange does not suffer\nfrom this threat as the server does not have a high entropic secret at all.\nHowever, known password-only key exchange are not very efficient (note: we only\nconsider protocols without random oracles). This motivates us to study\nefficient and secure asymmetric password key exchange that avoids the new\nthreat. In this paper, we first provide a formal model for the new threat,\nwhere essentially we require that the active adversary can break $\\ell$\npasswords in $\\alpha\\ell |{\\cal D}|$ steps (for $\\alpha<1/2$) only with a\nprobability negligibly close to $\\exp(-\\beta\\ell)$ for some $\\beta>0$.

For a given\nassignment of edge weights (the tolls), the highway owner collects from each\ndriver the weight of the associated path, when it does not exceed the budget of\nthe driver, and zero otherwise. The goal is choosing weights so as to maximize\nthe profit.\n  A lot of research has been devoted to this apparently simple problem. The\nhighway problem was shown to be strongly NP-hard only recently\n[Elbassioni,Raman,Ray-'09]. The best-known approximation is O(\\log n/\\log\\log\nn) [Gamzu,Segev-'10], which improves on the previous-best O(\\log n)\napproximation [Balcan,Blum-'06].\n  In this paper we present a PTAS for the highway problem, hence closing the\ncomplexity status of the problem. Our result is based on a novel randomized\ndissection approach, which has some points in common with Arora's quadtree\ndissection for Euclidean network design [Arora-'98]. The basic idea is\nenclosing the highway in a bounding path, such that both the size of the\nbounding path and the position of the highway in it are random variables. Then\nwe consider a recursive O(1)-ary dissection of the bounding path, in subpaths\nof uniform optimal weight. Since the optimal weights are unknown, we construct\nthe dissection in a bottom-up fashion via dynamic programming, while computing\nthe approximate solution at the same time. Our algorithm can be easily\nderandomized. We demonstrate the versatility of our technique by presenting\nPTASs for two variants of the highway problem: the tollbooth problem with a\nconstant number of leaves and the maximum-feasibility subsystem problem on\ninterval matrices.

The model is calibrated by fitting the\ncalculated spectrum to the observations of the Crab Nebula at an age of a\nthousand years. The spectral evolution of the Crab Nebula in our model shows\nthat the flux ratio of TeV gamma-rays to X-rays increases with time, which\nimplies that old PWNe are faint in X-rays, but not in TeV gamma-rays. The\nincrease of this ratio is because the magnetic field decreases with time and is\nnot because the X-ray emitting particles are cooled more rapidly than the TeV\ngamma-ray emitting particles. Our spectral evolution model matches the observed\nrate of the radio flux decrease of the Crab Nebula. This result implies that\nour magnetic field evolution model is close to the reality.

We investigate the ground\nstate phase diagram of superfluidity for such mixtures in the BCS-BEC\nevolution, and find normal, gapped superfluid, gapless superfluid, and phase\nseparated regions. In particular, we find a stable gapless superfluid phase\nwhere the unpaired $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ fermions coexist with the paired\n(or superfluid) ones in different momentum space regions. This phase is in some\nways similar to the Sarma state found in mixtures with unequal densities, but\nin our case, the gapless superfluid phase is unpolarized and most importantly\nit is stable against phase separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 07:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 05:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 13:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Here, we are interested in\nproving confluence for polygraphs presenting 2-categories, which can be seen as\na generalization of term rewriting systems. For this purpose, we propose an\nadaptation of the usual algorithm for computing critical pairs.

Here we investigate\nthe hierarchical modular (or \"modules-within-modules\") decomposition of human\nbrain functional networks, measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) in 18 healthy volunteers under no-task or resting conditions. We used a\ncustomized template to extract networks with more than 1800 regional nodes, and\nwe applied a fast algorithm to identify nested modular structure at several\nhierarchical levels. We used mutual information, 0 < I < 1, to estimate the\nsimilarity of community structure of networks in different subjects, and to\nidentify the individual network that is most representative of the group.\nResults show that human brain functional networks have a hierarchical modular\norganization with a fair degree of similarity between subjects, I=0.63. The\nlargest 5 modules at the highest level of the hierarchy were medial occipital,\nlateral occipital, central, parieto-frontal and fronto-temporal systems;\noccipital modules demonstrated less sub-modular organization than modules\ncomprising regions of multimodal association cortex. Connector nodes and hubs,\nwith a key role in inter-modular connectivity, were also concentrated in\nassociation cortical areas. We conclude that methods are available for\nhierarchical modular decomposition of large numbers of high resolution brain\nfunctional networks using computationally expedient algorithms. This could\nenable future investigations of Simon's original hypothesis that hierarchy or\nnear-decomposability of physical symbol systems is a critical design feature\nfor their fast adaptivity to changing environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 10:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}

Quantum fluctuations, deeply rooted in Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple, and not thermal fluctuations, drive the system from one phase to\nanother. Typically, the relative strength of two competing terms in the\nsystem's Hamiltonian is changed across a finite critical value. A well-known\nexample is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an\ninsulating phase, which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic\ngases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to\nlower-dimensional geometry a novel type of quantum phase transition may be\ninduced for which an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian is\nsufficient to drive the transition. Here, for a one-dimensional (1D) quantum\ngas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions, we observe the\ncommensurate-incommensurate quantum phase transition from a superfluid\nLuttinger liquid to a Mott-insulator. For sufficiently strong interactions, the\ntransition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice\ncommensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of\nthe atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the\nstrongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based\non the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model. We trace the phase boundary all the\nway to the weakly interacting regime where we find good agreement with the\npredictions of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model.

The nonclassicality criteria are based on Vogel's criterion\ncorresponding to analyzing the positivity of multimode P functions or,\nequivalently, the positivity of matrices of expectation values of, e.g.,\ncreation and annihilation operators. We analyze not only monomials, but also\npolynomial functions of such moments, which can sometimes enable simpler\nderivations of physically relevant inequalities. As an example, we derive\nvarious classical inequalities which can be violated only by nonclassical\nfields. In particular, we show how the criteria introduced here easily reduce\nto the well-known inequalities describing: (a) multimode quadrature squeezing\nand its generalizations including sum, difference and principal squeezing, (b)\ntwo-mode one-time photon-number correlations including sub-Poisson\nphoton-number correlations and effects corresponding to violations of the\nCauchy-Schwarz and Muirhead inequalities, (c) two-time single-mode\nphoton-number correlations including photon antibunching and hyperbunching, and\n(d) two- and three-mode quantum entanglement. Other simple inequalities for\ntesting nonclassicality are also proposed. We have found some general relations\nbetween the nonclassicality and entanglement criteria, in particular, those\nresulting from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It is shown that some known\nentanglement inequalities can be derived as nonclassicality inequalities within\nour formalism, while some other known entanglement inequalities can be seen as\nsums of more than one inequality derived from the nonclassicality criterion.\nThis approach enables a deeper analysis of the entanglement for a given\nnonclassicality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 13:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 09:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-23"}

The hierarchy of the\nanomalies is the same as for water. We study the effect on the anomalies of\nvarying the softness of the potential. We find that, making the soft-core\nsteeper, the regions of density and diffusion anomalies contract in the T -\n{\\rho} plane, while the region of structural anomaly is weakly affected.\nTherefore, a liquid can have anomalous structural behavior without density or\ndiffusion anomalies. We show that, by considering as effective distances those\ncorresponding to the maxima of the first two peaks of the radial distribution\nfunction g(r) in the high-density liquid, we can generalize to continuous\ntwo-scales potentials a criterion for the occurrence of the anomalies of\ndensity and diffusion, originally proposed for discontinuous potentials.

The oscillator position is a stochastic process due to\nthe oscillator-spin interaction which produces drastic changes in the\nequilibrium behaviour and the dynamics of the oscillator.

This transition appears because the\noscillator moves in an effective potential equal to the harmonic term plus the\nfree energy of the spin system at fixed oscillator position. Secondly, assuming\nfast spin relaxation (compared to the oscillator natural period), the\noscillator dynamical behaviour is described by an effective equation containing\na nonlinear friction term that drives the oscillator towards the stable\nequilibrium state of the effective potential.

In a recent\npaper, Bousquet-M\\'elou et al.\\cite{BCDK} found, using so called ascent\nsequences, the generating function for the number of (2+2)-free posets of size\n$n$: $P(t)=\\sum_{n \\geq 0} p_n t^n = \\sum_{n\\geq 0} \\prod_{i=1}^{n}\n(1-(1-t)^i)$. We extend this result in two ways. First, we find the generating\nfunction for (2+2)-free posets when four statistics are taken into account, one\nof which is the number of minimal elements in a poset. Second, we show that if\n$p_{n,k}$ equals the number of (2+2)-free posets of size $n$ with $k$ minimal\nelements, then $P(t,z)=\\sum_{n,k \\geq 0} p_{n,k} t^n z^k = 1+ \\sum_{n \\geq 0}\n\\frac{zt}{(1-zt)^{n+1}} \\prod_{i=1}^n (1-(1-t)^i)$.

Moreover, we conjecture a simpler form of\nwriting $P(t,z)$. Our enumeration results are extended to certain restricted\npermutations and to regular linearized chord diagrams through bijections in\n\\cite{BCDK,cdk}.

To achieve this result we extend our previous work [C.Conti,\nL.Gemignani, L.Romani, Linear Algebra Appl. 431 (2009), no. 10, 1971-1987] to\nfull generality by removing additional assumptions on the input symbols. For\nthe so obtained interpolatory schemes we prove that they are capable of\nreproducing the same exponential polynomial space as the one generated by the\noriginal approximating scheme. Moreover, we specialize the computational\nmethods for the case of symbols obtained by shifted non-stationary affine\ncombinations of exponential B-splines, that are at the basis of most\nnon-stationary subdivision schemes. In this case we find that the associated\nfamily of interpolatory symbols can be determined to satisfy a suitable set of\ngeneralized interpolating conditions at the set of the zeros (with reversed\nsigns) of the input symbol. Finally, we discuss some computational examples by\nshowing that the proposed approach can yield novel smooth non-stationary\ninterpolatory subdivision schemes possessing very interesting reproduction\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 15:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}
