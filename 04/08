The classical $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the two dimensional (2D)\nhoneycomb lattice has N\\'eel order for $J_2 < J_1/6$. For $J_2 > J_1/6$, it\nexhibits a one-parameter family of degenerate incommensurate spin spiral ground\nstates where the spiral wave vector can point in any direction. Spin wave\nfluctuations at leading order lift this accidental degeneracy in favor of\nspecific wave vectors, leading to spiral order by disorder. For spin $S=1/2$,\nquantum fluctuations are, however, likely to be strong enough to melt the\nspiral order parameter over a wide range of $J_2/J_1$. Over a part of this\nrange, we argue that the resulting state is a valence bond solid (VBS) with\nstaggered dimer order - this VBS is a nematic which breaks lattice rotational\nsymmetry. Our arguments are supported by comparing the spin wave energy with\nthe energy of the dimer solid obtained using a bond operator formalism. Turning\nto the effect of thermal fluctuations on the spiral ordered state, any nonzero\ntemperature destroys the magnetic order, but the discrete rotational symmetry\nof the lattice remains broken resulting in a thermal analogue of the nematic\nVBS. We present arguments, supported by classical Monte Carlo simulations, that\nthis nematic transforms into the high temperature symmetric paramagnet via a\nthermal phase transition which is in the universality class of the classical\n3-state Potts (clock) model in 2D. We discuss the possible relevance of our\nresults for honeycomb magnets, such as Bi$_3$M$_4$O$_{12}$(NO$_3$) (with\nM=Mn,V,Cr), and bilayer triangular lattice magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 16:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 17:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

While many theoretical models consider magnetic\nreconnection as a possible way of generating energetic electrons, the precise\nroles of magnetic reconnection during acceleration and heating of electrons\nstill remain unclear. Here we show from 2D particle-in-cell simulations that\ncoalescence of magnetic islands that naturally form as a consequence of tearing\nmode instability and associated magnetic reconnection leads to efficient\nenergization of electrons.

In low mass haloes, or at\nhigh redshift, however, the gas cooling rate is sufficiently rapid that an\naccretion shock is unlikely to form. Instead, gas can accrete directly into the\ncentre of the halo in a `cold mode' of accretion. Although semi-analytic models\nhave always made a clear distinction between hydrostatic and rapid cooling they\nhave not made a distinction between whether or not an accretion shock forms.\nStarting from the well-established Galform code, we investigate the effect of\nexplicitly accounting for cold mode accretion using the shock stability model\nof Birnboim & Dekel. When we modify the code so that there is no effective\nfeedback from galaxy formation, we find that cold mode accretion is the\ndominant channel for feeding gas into the galaxies at high redshifts. However,\nthis does not translate into a significant difference in the star formation\nhistory of the universe compared to the previous code. When effective feedback\nis included in the model, we find that the the cold mode is much less apparent\nbecause of the presence of gas ejected from the galaxy. Thus the inclusion of\nthe additional cold mode physics makes little difference to basic results from\nearlier semi-analytic models which used a simpler treatment of gas accretion.\nFor more sophisticated predictions of its consequences, we require a better\nunderstanding of how the cold mode delivers angular momentum to galaxies and\nhow it interacts with outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 19:34:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 16:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-09"}

The lensing signal can be extracted by correlating quasar magnitudes\nwith the flux power spectrum and with the flux decrement.

The failure to identify the\ntypes of binaries which produce SNeIa is the \"progenitor problem\". Its solution\nis required if we are to utilize the full potential of SNeIa to elucidate basic\ncosmological and physical principles. In single-degenerate models, a WD\naccretes and burns matter at high rates. Nuclear-burning WDs (NBWDs) with mass\nclose to M_C are hot and luminous, potentially detectable as supersoft x-ray\nsources (SSSs). In previous work we showed that > 90-99% of the required number\nof progenitors do not appear as SSSs during most of the crucial phase of mass\nincrease. The obvious implication is that double-degenerate (DD) binaries form\nthe main class of progenitors. We show in this paper, however, that many\nbinaries that later become DDs must pass through a long-lived NBWD phase during\nwhich they are potentially detectable as SSSs. The paucity of SSSs is therefore\nnot a strong argument in favor of DD models. Those NBWDs that are the\nprogenitors of DD binaries are likely to appear as symbiotic binaries for\nintervals > 10^6 years. In fact, symbiotic pre-DDs should be common, whether or\nnot the WDs eventually produce SNeIa. The key to solving the progenitor problem\nlies in understanding the appearance of NBWDs. Most do not appear as SSSs most\nof the time. We therefore consider the evolution of NBWDs to address the\nquestion of what their appearance may be and how we can hope to detect them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 21:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\nstandard dynamic programming solution for this problem computes the\nedit-distance between a pair of strings of total length O(N) in O(N^2) time. To\nthis date, this quadratic upper-bound has never been substantially improved for\ngeneral strings. However, there are known techniques for breaking this bound in\ncase the strings are known to compress well under a particular compression\nscheme. The basic idea is to first compress the strings, and then to compute\nthe edit distance between the compressed strings. As it turns out, practically\nall known o(N^2) edit-distance algorithms work, in some sense, under the same\nparadigm described above. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a\nsingle edit-distance algorithm that works for strings which are compressed\nunder any compression scheme. A rephrasing of this question is to ask whether a\nsingle algorithm can exploit the compressibility properties of strings under\nany compression method, even if each string is compressed using a different\ncompression. In this paper we set out to answer this question by using straight\nline programs. These provide a generic platform for representing many popular\ncompression schemes including the LZ-family, Run-Length Encoding, Byte-Pair\nEncoding, and dictionary methods. For two strings of total length N having\nstraight-line program representations of total size n, we present an algorithm\nrunning in O(nN log(N/n)) time for computing the edit-distance of these two\nstrings under any rational scoring function, and an O(n^{2/3}N^{4/3}) time\nalgorithm for arbitrary scoring functions. Our new result, while providing a\nsigni cant speed up for highly compressible strings, does not surpass the\nquadratic time bound even in the worst case scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 21:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

The roles of temperature, adhesive interactions\nand atomic structure are studied for simple geometries. An elastic, crystalline\nsubstrate contacts a rigid, atomically flat surface or a spherical tip. The\nrigid surface is formed from a commensurate or incommensurate crystal or an\namorphous solid. Spherical tips are made by bending crystalline planes or\nremoving material outside a sphere. In continuum theory the fraction of\natomically flat surfaces that is in contact rises sharply from zero to unity\nwhen a load is applied. This simple behavior is surprisingly difficult to\nreproduce with atomic scale definitions of contact. Due to thermal\nfluctuations, the number of atoms making contact at any instant rises linearly\nwith load over a wide range of loads. Pressures comparable to the ideal\nhardness are needed to achieve full contact at typical temperatures. A simple\nharmonic mean-field theory provides a quantitative description of this behavior\nand explains why the instantaneous forces on atoms have a universal exponential\nform. Contact areas are also obtained by counting the number of atoms with a\ntime-averaged repulsive force. For adhesive interactions, the resulting area is\nnearly independent of temperature and averaging interval, but usually rises\nfrom zero to unity over a range of pressures that is comparable to the ideal\nhardness. The only exception is the case of two identical commensurate\nsurfaces. For nonadhesive surfaces, the mean pressure is repulsive if there is\nany contact during the averaging interval $\\Delta t$. The associated area is\nvery sensitive to $\\Delta t$ and grows monotonically. Similar complications are\nencountered in defining contact areas for spherical tips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 22:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

Optical V band photometry reveals a very steep brightness\ndecline between the plateau and nebular phases of ~4.5 mag, likely due to SN\n2007od containing a low mass of 56Ni. The optical spectra show an evolution\nfrom normal Type IIP with broad Halpha emission, to a complex, four component\nHalpha emission profile exhibiting asymmetries caused by dust extinction after\nday 232. This is similar to the spectral evolution of the Type IIn SN 1998S,\nalthough no early-time narrow (~200 km s-1) Halpha component was present in SN\n2007od. In both SNe, the intermediate-width Halpha emission components are\nthought to arise in the interaction between the ejecta and its circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). SN 2007od also shows a mid-IR excess due to new dust. The\nevolution of the Halpha profile and the presence of the mid-IR excess provide\nstrong evidence that SN 2007od formed new dust before day 232. Late-time\nobservations reveal a flattening of the visible lightcurve. This flattening is\na strong indication of the presence of a light echo, which likely accounts for\nmuch of the broad, underlying Halpha component seen at late-times. We believe\nthe multi-peaked Halpha emission is consistent with the interaction of the\nejecta with a circumstellar ring or torus (for the inner components at \\pm1500\nkm s-1), and a single blob or cloud of circumstellar material out of the plane\nof the CSM ring (for the outer component at -5000 km s-1). The most probable\nlocation for the formation of new dust is in the cool dense shell created by\nthe interaction between the expanding ejecta and its CSM. Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer modeling of the dust emission from SN 2007od implies that up to 4x\n10-4Msun of new dust has formed. This is similar to the amounts of dust formed\nin other CCSNe such as SNe 1999em, 2004et, and 2006jc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 23:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A specific solution to the problem of image\nrestoration is generally determined by the nature of degradation phenomenon as\nwell as by the statistical properties of measurement noises. The present study\nis concerned with the case in which the images of interest are corrupted by\nconvolutional blurs and Poisson noises. To deal with such problems, there\nexists a range of solution methods which are based on the principles\noriginating from the fixed-point algorithm of Richardson and Lucy (RL). In this\npaper, we provide conceptual and experimental proof that such methods tend to\nconverge to sparse solutions, which makes them applicable only to those images\nwhich can be represented by a relatively small number of non-zero samples in\nthe spatial domain. Unfortunately, the set of such images is relatively small,\nwhich restricts the applicability of RL-type methods. On the other hand,\nvirtually all practical images admit sparse representations in the domain of a\nproperly designed linear transform. To take advantage of this fact, it is\ntherefore tempting to modify the RL algorithm so as to make it recover\nrepresentation coefficients, rather than the values of their associated image.\nSuch modification is introduced in this paper. Apart from the generality of its\nassumptions, the proposed method is also superior to many established\nreconstruction approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and computational\ncomplexity. This and other conclusions of this study are validated through a\nseries of numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 01:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-09"}

FATT\nindexing technique, features of the image is extracted using 2-dimensional\ndiscrete wavelet transform (2DDWT) and index code is generated from the\ndeterminant value of the features. Multiresolution analysis technique using\n2D-DWT can decompose the image into components at different scales, so that the\ncoarest scale components carry the global approximation information while the\nfiner scale components contain the detailed information.

We propose a set of\nexperiments to clarify the distinction between the large-sample limit when bulk\ndisorder defines the IQHE plateau width and the small-sample limit smaller than\nthe disorder correlation length, when self-consistent edge electrostatics\ndefine the IQHE plateau width. The large-sample or bulk QH regime is described\nby the usual localization picture, whereas the small-sample or edge regime is\ndiscussed within the compressible/incompressible strips picture, known as the\nscreening theory of QH edges. Utilizing the unusually sharp edge profiles of\nthe CEO samples, a Hall bar design is proposed to manipulate the edge potential\nprofile from smooth to extremely sharp. By making use of a side-gate\nperpendicular to the two dimensional electron system, it is shown that the\nplateau widths can be changed or even eliminated altogether. Hence, the\nvisibility of IQHE is strongly influenced when adjusting the edge potential\nprofile and/or changing the dc current direction under high currents in the\nnon-linear transport regime. As a second investigation, we consider two\ndifferent types of ohmic contacts, namely highly transmitting (ideal) and\nhighly reflecting (non-ideal) contacts. We show that if the injection contacts\nare non-ideal, however still ohmic, it is possible to measure directly the\nnon-quantized transport taking place at the bulk of the CEO samples.

Luminosities are calculated for all age-dated clusters.\nAges of 324 and 1193 populous star clusters in the Small and the Large\nMagellanic Cloud have been determined fitting Padova and Geneva isochrone\nmodels to their resolved color-magnitude diagrams. The clusters cover an age\nrange between 10Myr and 1Gyr in each galaxy. For the SMC a constant distance\nmodulus of $(m-M)_0$ = 18.90 and a metallicity of Z = 0.004 were adopted. For\nthe LMC, we used a constant distance modulus of $(m-M)_0$ = 18.50 and a\nmetallicity of Z = 0.008. For both galaxies, we used a variable color excess to\nderive the cluster ages. We find two periods of enhanced cluster formation in\nboth galaxies at 160Myr and 630Myr (SMC) and at 125Myr and 800Myr (LMC). We\npresent the spatially resolved recent star formation history of both Clouds\nbased on young star clusters. The first peak may have been triggered by a close\nencounter between the SMC and the LMC. In both galaxies the youngest clusters\nreside in the supergiant shells, giant shells, the inter-shell regions, and\ntoward regions with a high H$\\alpha$ content, suggesting that their formation\nis related to expansion and shell-shell interaction. Most of the clusters are\nolder than the dynamical age of the supergiant shells. No evidence for cluster\ndissolution was found.

The radio halo spectrum of Coma is well fitted only\nin the $b{\\bar b}$ or light and intermediate mass DM models. The heating\nproduced by DM annihilation in the center of Coma is always larger than the\nintracluster gas cooling rate for an NFW DM density profile and it is\nsubstantially smaller than the cooling rate only for a cored DM density profile\nin DM model with 9 GeV. We conclude that the possibility of interpreting the\norigin of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters with DM annihilation models\nrequires a low neutralino mass and a cored DM density profile. If we then\nconsider the multimessenger constraints to the neutralino annihilation\ncross-section, it turns out that such scenario would also be excluded unless we\nintroduce a substantial boost factor due to the presence of DM substructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 09:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

They contain an exposition of the representation\ntheory of the Lie algebras of compact matrix groups, affine Kac-Moody algebras\nand the Virasoro algebra from a unitary point of view. The treatment uses many\nof the methods of conformal field theory, in particular the Goddard-Kent-Olive\nconstruction and the Kazami-Suzuki supercharge operator, a generalisation of\nthe Dirac operator. The proof of the Weyl character formula is taken from\nunpublished notes of Peter Goddard. The supersymmetric proof of the Kac\ncharacter formula for affine Kac-Moody algebras was also found independently at\nroughly the same time by Greg Landweber in his Harvard Ph.D. dissertation. One\nof the main novelties of this approach is a very rapid proof of the\nFeigin-Fuchs character formula for the discrete series representations of the\nVirasoro algebra. It relies only on the first part of the Friedan-Qiu-Shenker\nunitarity theorem placing restrictions on the parameter h. Their result, which\nonly uses elementary properties of plane curves, is presented in detail in\nthese notes along with the somewhat harder result for c. A substantially\nshorter treatment is possible if the final goal is just the Feigin-Fuchs\nformula, since in that case only the representation theory of affine sl(2) is\nneeded (cf the MSRI summer course given in 2000,\nhttp://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/opal/wassermann/).

One of its main limitations is the lack of\na computationally fast method to determine the two parameters fuzzifier and\ncluster number. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of\npurely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data.\nThe optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not\nyield any results for a purely random data set but which detects cluster\nformation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness. Estimation of the\noptimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the\nclustering procedure applied to randomized data sets. In this case, the optimal\nvalue of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main\nproperties of the data set. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of\nobjects as input values instead of evaluating the entire data set allows us to\npropose a functional relationship determining its value directly. This result\nspeaks strongly against setting the fuzzifier equal to 2 as typically done in\nmany previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation\nof the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance\nbetween the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better\nthan those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 10:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-09"}

Beyond the standard\nsolution, also pore-fluid segregation, which is typically associated with\nfluidization of the granular material, can arise. Pore-fluid segregation has\nbeen recognized as a phenomenon typical of the short time behavior of a\nsaturated porous slab or a saturated porous sphere, during consolidation. In\nboth circumstances Biot's three dimensional model provides time increasing\nvalues of the water pressure (and fluid mass density) at the center of the slab\n(or of the sphere), at early times, if the Lam\\'{e} constant $\\mu$ of the\nskeleton is different from zero. This localized pore-fluid segregation is known\nin the literature as Mandel--Cryer effect. In this paper a non linear\nporomechanical model is formulated. The model is able to describe the\noccurrence of two states of equilibrium and the switching from one to the other\nby considering a kind of \\textit{phase transition}. Extending classical Biot's\ntheory a more than quadratic strain energy potential is postulated, depending\non the strain of the porous material and the variation of the fluid mass\ndensity (measured with respect to the skeleton reference volume). When the\nconsolidating pressure is strong enough the existence of two distinct minima is\nproven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 11:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Connecting a\nsuperconductor to such a cavity leads to notable proximity effects,\nparticularly the appearance, predicted by random matrix theory, of a hard gap\nin the excitation spectrum of quantum chaotic systems. Andreev billiards are\ninteresting examples of such structures built with superconductors connected to\na ballistic normal metal billiard since each time an electron hits the\nsuperconducting part it is retroreflected as a hole (and vice-versa). Using a\nsemiclassical framework for systems with chaotic dynamics, we show how this\nreflection, along with the interference due to subtle correlations between the\nclassical paths of electrons and holes inside the system, are ultimately\nresponsible for the gap formation. The treatment can be extended to include the\neffects of a symmetry breaking magnetic field in the normal part of the\nbilliard or an Andreev billiard connected to two phase shifted superconductors.\nTherefore we are able to see how these effects can remold and eventually\nsuppress the gap. Furthermore the semiclassical framework is able to cover the\neffect of a finite Ehrenfest time which also causes the gap to shrink. However\nfor intermediate values this leads to the appearance of a second hard gap - a\nclear signature of the Ehrenfest time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 13:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2011 09:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-06"}

In this paper we investigate the\nspatial variations of the mid-IR emission which includes: fine structure lines,\nmolecular hydrogen lines, polycyclic aromatic features (PAHs), continuum\nemission and the 9.7um silicate feature. We also compare the nuclear and\nintegrated spectra. We find that the star formation takes place in extended\nregions (several kpc) as probed by the PAH emission as well as the [NeII] and\n[NeIII] emissions. The behavior of the integrated PAH emission and 9.7um\nsilicate feature is similar to that of local starburst galaxies. We also find\nthat the minima of the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio tends to be located at the nuclei\nand its value is lower than that of HII regions in our LIRGs and nearby\ngalaxies. It is likely that increased densities in the nuclei of LIRGs are\nresponsible for the smaller nuclear [NeIII]/[NeII] ratios. This includes the\npossibility that some of the most massive stars in the nuclei are still\nembedded in ultracompact HII regions. In a large fraction of our sample the\n11.3um PAH emission appears more extended than the dust 5.5um continuum\nemission. We find a dependency of the 11.3um PAH/7.7 um PAH and [NeII]/11.3um\nPAH ratios with the age of the stellar populations. Smaller and larger ratios\nrespectively indicate recent star formation. The estimated warm (300 K < T <\n1000 K) molecular hydrogen masses are of the order of 10^8 M_Sun, which are\nsimilar to those found in ULIRGs, local starbursts and Seyfert galaxies.\nFinally we find that the [NeII] velocity fields for most of the LIRGs in our\nsample are compatible with a rotating disk at ~kpc scales, and they are in a\ngood agreement with H-alpha velocity fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 15:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Our current understanding of this motion\nis based on a number of detailed computational models. Although these models\nrealize possible mechanisms for force transduction, they can be extended by\nvariation of any of a large number of poorly measured parameters and there is\nno clear strategy for determining how they might be distinguished\nexperimentally. Here we seek to identify and analyze two distinct mechanisms\npresent in the computational models. In the first the splayed protofilaments at\nthe end of the depolymerizing MT physically prevent the Dam1 ring from falling\noff the end, in the other an attractive binding secures the ring to the\nmicrotubule. Based on this analysis, we discuss how to distinguish between\ncompeting models that seek to explain how the Dam1 ring stays on the MT. We\npropose novel experimental approaches that could resolve these models for the\nfirst time, either by changing the diffusion constant of the Dam1 ring (e.g.,\nby tethering a long polymer to it) or by using a time varying load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 15:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}
