The minimal sampling rate for these\nparametric signals is referred to as the rate of innovation and is equal to the\nnumber of degrees of freedom per unit time. Although sampling of infinite pulse\nstreams was treated in previous works, either the rate of innovation was not\nachieved, or the pulse shape was limited to Diracs. In this paper we propose a\nmultichannel architecture for sampling pulse streams with arbitrary shape,\noperating at the rate of innovation. Our approach is based on modulating the\ninput signal with a set of properly chosen waveforms, followed by a bank of\nintegrators. This architecture is motivated by recent work on sub-Nyquist\nsampling of multiband signals. We show that the pulse stream can be recovered\nfrom the proposed minimal-rate samples using standard tools taken from spectral\nestimation in a stable way even at high rates of innovation. In addition, we\naddress practical implementation issues, such as reduction of hardware\ncomplexity and immunity to failure in the sampling channels. The resulting\nscheme is flexible and exhibits better noise robustness than previous\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 16:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 06:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 19:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2010 09:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 07:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Together with the stronger no-cloning theorem they\nprovide permanence to quantum information, thus, suggesting that in the quantum\nworld information can neither be created nor be destroyed. In this sense\nquantum information is robust, but at the same time it is also fragile because\nany interaction with the environment may lead to loss of information. Recently,\nanother fundamental theorem was proved, namely, the no-hiding theorem that\naddresses precisely the issue of information loss. It says that if any physical\nprocess leads to bleaching of quantum information from the original system,\nthen it must reside in the rest of the universe with no information being\nhidden in the correlation between these two subsystems. This has applications\nin quantum teleportation, state randomization, private quantum channels,\nthermalization and black hole evaporation. Here, we report experimental test of\nthe no-hiding theorem with the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\nWe use the quantum state randomization of a qubit as one example of the\nbleaching process and show that the missing information can be fully recovered\nup to local unitary transformations in the ancilla qubits.

The time-dependent diagrammatic\ntheory in terms of the Cu-O hopping t_pd starts from the locally gauge\ninvariant state with vanishing occupation of the Cu state and builds a finite\nn_d in higher orders. This theory is locally gauge invariant asymptotically,\nbut replaces the d-p anticommutation between the Cu and O sites by the\ncommutation and is antisymmetrized a posteriori. Rather than t_pd, the small\nparameter of the theory is n_d less or equal to 1/2. The leading many body\neffect is band narrowing, different from the mean-field one. It is accompanied\nby the d10-d9 intracell charge transfer disorder, which breaks the Luttinger\nsum rule for the conduction band. The corresponding damping of the single\nparticle propagation is situated well below the Fermi level. The effective\nlocal repulsions between the hybridized pdp propagators show up beyond the\nthird order. The a posteriori antisymmetrization removes the triplet repulsion\nbetween the pdp particles but keeps the singlet repulsion which favors\nincommensurate SDW correlations at low energy.

In addition, most methods have\ndifficulty assigning correct statistical significance to terms with few\nentities. Implementing the well-known Lugananni-Rice formula, we have developed\na novel approach, called SaddleSum, that is free from all the aforementioned\nconstraints and evaluated it against several existing methods. With entity\nweights properly taken into account, SaddleSum is internally consistent and\nstable with respect to the choice of number of most significant entities\nselected. Making few assumptions on the input data, the proposed method is\nuniversal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis of microarrays.\nEmploying asymptotic approximation, SaddleSum provides a term-size dependent\nscore distribution function that gives rise to accurate statistical\nsignificance even for terms with few entities. As a consequence, SaddleSum\nenables researchers to place confidence in its significance assignments to\nsmall terms that are often biologically most specific.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 17:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 21:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-25"}

The theory resolves the famous I-J\nparadox of the 1980s, based on co-selection involving helper T cells with some\naffinity for MHC class II and suppressor T cells that are anti-anti-MHC class\nII. The theory leads to an experimentally testable prediction concerning I-J. A\nmathematical model that simulates IgM killing and inhibition of IgM killing by\nT cells is surprisingly the same as one that models a neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 18:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

This delay makes\nit possible to use short gamma-ray burst alerts to promptly monitor specific\nregions on the sky by low-frequency radio facilities, especially by LOFAR. To\nestimate the strength of the radio signal, we assume a power-law dependence of\nthe radio luminosity on the total energy release in a magnetically dominated\noutflow, as found in millisecond pulsars.

We\ninvestigate the LINER-Seyfert connection by studying the unabsorbed, AGN\npowered, LINER galaxy NGC 4278. We analyzed one XMM-Newton and seven Chandra\nX-ray observations of NGC 4278 spread over a three year period. We detected a\nflux increase by a factor of ~3 on a ~3 months time-scale and by a factor of 5\nbetween the faintest and the brightest observation separated by ~3 years.\nDuring only the XMM-Newton observation, where the highest flux level is\ndetected, we found a 10% flux increase on a ~1 hour time-scale. A combination\nof an absorbed power law (N(H)~10^20 cm^-2, Gamma~2.2) plus a thermal component\n(kT~0.6 keV) were able to fit the Chandra spectra. The XMM-Newton spectra,\nwhere the highest X-ray flux is detected, are well fitted with a single\nabsorbed power-law. No Fe K(alpha) emission line is detected at 6.4 keV. We\nconstructed SEDs based on simultaneous or quasi simultaneous observations and\ncompared them to LINER, radio-loud, and radio-quiet quasar SEDs.

Although we\ndetect trace amounts of star formation at times more recent than 10 Gyr for all\nfields, the proportion of red giant stars to asymptotic giants and main\nsequence stars suggests that the disk is dominated by an ancient (>10 Gyr)\npopulation. Detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagram suggests that ~70%\nof the stellar mass in the NGC 404 disk formed by z~2 (10 Gyr ago) and at least\n~90% formed prior to z~1 (8 Gyr ago). These results indicate that the stellar\npopulations of the NGC 404 disk are on average significantly older than those\nof other nearby disk galaxies, suggesting that early and late type disks may\nhave different long-term evolutionary histories, not simply differences in\ntheir recent star formation rates. Comparisons of the spatial distribution of\nthe young stellar mass and FUV emission in GALEX images show that the brightest\nFUV regions contain the youngest stars, but that some young stars (<160 Myr)\nlie outside of these regions. FUV luminosity appears to be strongly affected by\nboth age and stellar mass within individual regions. Finally, we use our\nmeasurements to infer the relationship between the star formation rate and the\ngas density of the disk at previous epochs. We find that most of the history of\nthe NGC 404 disk is consistent with star formation that has decreased with the\ngas density according to the Schmidt law. However, 0.5-1 Gyr ago, the star\nformation rate was unusually low for the inferred gas density, consistent with\nthe possibility that there was a gas accretion event that reignited star\nformation ~0.5 Gyr ago.

The addition of the new WFC3 on the\nHST has made it possible to uniformly select LBGs from z~1 to z~9, and\nsignificantly enhance our understanding of these galaxies using HST sensitivity\nand resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 20:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 19:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The mobile ions\nare assumed to be insoluble in the B layers and hence confined to the A layers.\nWe find that the ions reduce the needed voltage most strongly when they are\nconstrained such that each A lamella is electrically neutral. In this case, a\nmacroscopic separation of charge and its concomitant lowering of free energy,\nis attained only in the perpendicular orientation. When the ions are free to\nmove between different A layers, such that charge neutrality is only required\nglobally, their effect is smaller and depends upon the preferred surface\ninteraction of the two materials. Under some conditions, the addition of ions\ncan actually stabilize the parallel configuration. Our predictions are relevant\nto recent experiments conducted on lamellar phases of diblock copolymer films\nwith ionic selective impurities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 22:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

In the case that each transmit\nantenna has its own power amplifier which has individual power limit, it has\nbeen known that only phase steering information is necessary to form the\noptimal transmit beamforming vector. Since temporal correlation exists for\nwireless fading channels, one can utilize the previous reported feedback\nmessages as prior information to efficiently encode the current feedback\nmessage. Thus, phase tracking information, difference between two phase\nsteering information in adjacent feedback slots, is sufficient as a feedback\nmessage. We show that while the entropy of the phase steering information is a\nconstant, the entropy of the phase tracking information is a function of the\ntemporal correlation parameter. For the phase tracking information, upperbounds\non the entropy are presented in the Gaussian entropy and the von-Mises entropy\nby using the theory on the maximum entropy distributions. Derived results can\nquantify the amount of reduction in feedback overhead of the phase tracking\ninformation over the phase steering information.

Recent work indicates that rotation curves due to\ndark matter (DM) halos at intermediate radii in spiral galaxies are remarkably\nsimilar, with a mean rotation curve given by\n$\\log_{10}[V_{c,\\mathrm{DM}}/(\\mathrm{km\ns^{-1}})]=1.47_{-0.19}^{+0.15}+0.5\\log_{10}[r/\\mathrm{kpc}]$. Independent\nstudies show that while estimates of the dark mass of a given dwarf spheroidal\n(dSph) galaxy are robust only near the half-light radius, data from the Milky\nWay's (MW's) dSph satellites are consistent with a narrow range of mass\nprofiles. Here we combine published constraints on the dark halo masses of\nspirals and dSphs and include available measurements of low surface brightness\ngalaxies for additional comparison. We find that most measured MW dSphs lie on\nthe extrapolation of the mean rotation curve due to DM in spirals. The union of\nMW-dSph and spiral data appears to follow a mass-radius relation of the form\n$M_{\\mathrm{DM}}(r)/M_{\\odot}=200_{-120}^{+200}(r/\\mathrm{pc})^2$, or\nequivalently a constant acceleration $g_{\\mathrm{DM}}=3_{-2}^{+3}\\times\n10^{-9}\\mathrm{cm s^{-2}}$, spanning $0.02\\la r \\la 75$ kpc. Evaluation at\nspecific radii immediately generates two results from the recent literature: a\ncommon mass for MW dSphs at fixed radius and a constant DM central surface\ndensity for galaxies ranging from MW dSphs to spirals. However, recent\nkinematic measurements indicate that M31's dSph satellites are systematically\nless massive than MW dSphs of similar size.

We consider the magnetic\nfield due to magnetopause currents in the dynamo region. Since the external\nfield of magnetospheric origin is antiparallel to the dipole component of the\ndynamo field, a negative feedback results. For an alpha-omega-dynamo two\nstationary solutions of such a feedback dynamo emerge, one with a weak and the\nother with a strong magnetic field.

To address this problem, we discuss various\nscenarios for a simple dynamo model and the conditions under which a steady\nweak magnetic field can be reached.

We\nshow that this is not the only rational strategy profile (the only subgame\nperfect equilibrium). Indeed if an agent stops and will stop at every step, we\nclaim that he is rational as well, if one admits that his opponent will never\nstop, because this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium. Amazingly, in\nthe infinite dollar auction game, the behavior in which both agents stop at\neach step is not a Nash equilibrium, hence is not a subgame perfect\nequilibrium, hence is not rational.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 12:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-30"}

The particle shapes are rounded-cap rectangles characterized by their\nelongation. The macroscopic and microstructural properties of several packings\nsubjected to biaxial compression are analyzed as a function of particle\nelongation. We find that the shear strength is an increasing linear function of\nelongation. Performing an additive decomposition of the stress tensor based on\na harmonic approximation of the angular dependence of branch vectors, contact\nnormals and forces, we show that the increasing mobilization of friction force\nand the associated anisotropy are key effects of particle elongation. These\neffects are correlated with partial nematic ordering of the particles which\ntend to be oriented perpendicular to the major principal stress direction and\nform side-to-side contacts. However, the force transmission is found to be\nmainly guided by cap-to-side contacts, which represent the largest fraction of\ncontacts for the most elongated particles. Another interesting finding is that,\nin contrast to shear strength, the solid fraction first increases with particle\nelongation, but declines as the particles become more elongated. It is also\nremarkable that the coordination number does not follow this trend so that the\npackings of more elongated particles are looser but more strongly connected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 14:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-12"}

More specifically, assuming that the\nultimate source of flare energy is mechanical energy in the convection zone,\nhow is this translated into energy dissipated or stored in the corona? This\nquestion appears to have been given relatively little thought, as attention has\nbeen focussed predominantly on mechanisms for the rapid dissipation of coronal\nmagnetic energy by way of MHD instabilities and plasma micro instabilities. We\nconsider three types of flare theory: the steady state \"photospheric dynamo\"\nmodel in which flare power represents coronal dissipation of currents generated\nsimultaneously by sub-photospheric flows; the \"magnetic energy storage\" model\nwhere sub-photospheric flows again induce coronal currents but which in this\ncase are built up over a longer period before being released suddenly; and\n\"emerging flux\" models, in which new magnetic flux rising to the photosphere\nalready contains free energy, and does not require subsequent stressing by\nphotospheric motions. We conclude that photospheric dynamos can power only very\nminor flares; that coronal energy storage can in principle meet the\nrequirements of a major flare, although perhaps not the very largest flares,\nbut that difficulties in coupling efficiently to the energy source may limit\nthis mechanism to moderate sized flares; and that emerging magnetic flux tubes,\ngenerated in the solar interior, can carry sufficient free energy to power even\nthe largest flares ever observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Inequivalent quantizations lead to\ndifferent physics. Recently, however, some uniqueness results have been\nobtained for fields in non-stationary settings. In particular, for vacua that\nare invariant under the background symmetries, a unitary implementation of the\nclassical evolution suffices to pick up a unique Fock quantization in the case\nof Klein-Gordon fields with time-dependent mass, propagating in a static\nspacetime whose spatial sections are three-spheres. In fact, the field equation\ncan be reinterpreted as describing the propagation in a\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime after a suitable scaling of the field by a\nfunction of time. For this class of fields, we prove here an even stronger\nresult about the Fock quantization: the uniqueness persists when one allows for\nlinear time-dependent transformations of the field in order to account for a\nscaling by background functions. In total, paying attention to the dynamics,\nthere exists a preferred choice of quantum field, and only one\n$SO(4)$-invariant Fock representation for it that respects the standard\nprobabilistic interpretation along the evolution.
