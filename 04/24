The memory\ngrows significantly during the late inspiral and merger, modifying the signal\nby an almost step-function profile, and making it difficult to model by\napproximate methods. We use numerical evolutions of binary black holes to\nevaluate the nonlinear memory during late-inspiral, merger and ringdown. We\nidentify two main components of the signal: the monotonically growing portion\ncorresponding to the memory, and an oscillatory part which sets in roughly at\nthe time of merger and is due to the black hole ringdown. Counter-intuitively,\nthe ringdown is most prominent for models with the lowest total spin. Thus, the\ncase of maximally spinning black holes anti-aligned to the orbital angular\nmomentum exhibits the highest signal-to-noise (SNR) for interferometric\ndetectors. The largest memory offset, however, occurs for highly spinning black\nholes, with an estimated value of h^tot_20 \\approx 0.24 in the maximally\nspinning case. These results are central to determining the detectability of\nnonlinear memory through pulsar timing array measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 19:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 07:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In extreme cases this interaction\nmay power the most luminous, optically-energetic SNe yet discovered.\nInterpretations for the origin of the CSM have thus far centered on explosive\neruptions from the star just ~ years to decades prior to the core collapse.\nHere we consider an alternative possibility that the inferred CSM is a relic\ndisk left over from stellar birth.

As simple consequences of our learning algorithm,\nwe can perform near-optimal clustering of the sample points and density\nestimation for mixtures of k Gaussians, efficiently. The building blocks of our\nalgorithm are based on the work Kalai et al.

A non-supersymmetric state with robust\nstability is constructed, and its exact stability is proven in a large region\nof moduli space of T^4 against all the possible decay mechanisms allowed by\ncharge conservation. Using string-string duality, the results are interpreted\nin terms of Dirichlet-branes in type IIA string theory compactified on an\norbifold limit of a K3 surface.

For this\npurpose, one has to sample the solution space with uniform weight. It is shown\nhere that standard stochastic local-search (SLS) algorithms like \"ASAT\" and\n\"MCMCMC\" (also known as \"parallel tempering\") exhibit a sampling bias.\nNevertheless, unbiased samples of solutions can be obtained using the\n\"ballistic-networking approach\", which is introduced here. It is a\ngeneralization of \"ballistic search\" methods and yields also a cluster\nstructure of the solution space. As application, solutions of 3-SAT instances\nare generated using ASAT plus ballistic networking. The numerical results are\ncompatible with a previous analytic prediction of a simple solution-space\nstructure for small values of alpha and a transition to a clustered phase at\nalpha_c ~ 3.86, where the solution space breaks up into several non-negligible\nclusters. Furthermore, in the thermodynamic limit there are, for values of\nalpha close to the SATUNSAT transition alpha_s ~ 4.267, always clusters without\nany frozen variables. This may explain why some SLS algorithms are able to\nsolve very large 3-SAT instances close to the SAT-UNSAT transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 21:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Harvesting acts as a (stochastic) control on the size of the\npopulation. The objective is to find a harvesting strategy which maximizes the\nexpected total discounted income from harvesting {\\em up to the time of\nextinction} of the species; the income rate is allowed to be state- and\nenvironment-dependent. This is a singular stochastic control problem with both\nthe extinction time and the optimal harvesting policy depending on the initial\ncondition. One aspect of receiving payments up to the random time of extinction\nis that small changes in the initial population size may significantly alter\nthe extinction time when using the same harvesting policy. Consequently, one no\nlonger obtains continuity of the value function using standard arguments for\neither regular or singular control problems having a fixed time horizon. This\npaper introduces a new sufficient condition under which the continuity of the\nvalue function for the regime-switching model is established. Further, it is\nshown that the value function is a viscosity solution of a coupled system of\nquasi-variational inequalities. The paper also establishes a verification\ntheorem and, based on this theorem, an $\\varepsilon$-optimal harvesting\nstrategy is constructed under certain conditions on the model.

At the\navailable 2 minute cadence, the G-band and hard X-ray intensities are\nfurthermore well correlated in time. Assuming that the G-band enhancements are\ncontinuum emission from a blackbody, we derived the total radiative losses of\nthe white-light flare (white-light power).

We compare the white-light power with the power in hard X-ray\nproducing electrons using the thick target assumption. Independent of the\ncutoff energy of the accelerated electron spectrum, the white-light power and\nthe power of accelerated electrons are roughly proportional. Using the observed\nupper limit of ~30 keV for the cutoff energy, the hard X-ray producing\nelectrons provide at least a factor of 2 more power than needed to produce the\nwhite-light emission. For electrons above 40 keV, the powers roughly match for\nall four of the time intervals available during the impulsive phase. Hence, the\nflare-accelerated electrons contain enough energy to produce the white-light\nflare emissions. The observed correlation in time, space, and power strongly\nsuggests that electron acceleration and white-light production in solar flares\nare closely related.

In this two-part paper, we consider SDL constructions of optical queues\nwith a limited number of recirculations through the optical switches and the\nfiber delay lines. Such a problem arises from practical feasibility\nconsiderations. In Part I, we have proposed a class of greedy constructions for\ncertain types of optical queues, including linear compressors, linear\ndecompressors, and 2-to-1 FIFO multiplexers, and have shown that every optimal\nconstruction among our previous constructions of these types of optical queues\nunder the constraint of a limited number of recirculations must be a greedy\nconstruction.

The result of\nthe reduction process is a discrete dynamical system that we call the discrete\nreduced system. We illustrate the techniques by analyzing two types of discrete\nsymmetric systems where it is possible to go further and obtain (forced)\ndiscrete mechanical systems that determine the dynamics of the discrete reduced\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2010 15:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}

The\nground state of Fe@C20 is found to be a septet state, and the magnetic moment\nof Fe@C20 is estimated to be 8 Bohr magnetons. Characteristics of an (8,8)\ncarbon nanotube with a single Fe@C20 inside are studied in the framework of the\nsemiempirical approach. The scheme of a magnetic nanorelay based on\ncantilevered nanotubes filled with magnetic endofullerenes is elaborated. The\nproposed nanorelay is turned on as a result of bending of nanotubes by a\nmagnetic force. Operational characteristics of such a nanorelay based on (8,8)\nand (21,21) nanotubes fully filled with Fe@C20 are estimated and compared to\nthe ones of a nanorelay made of a (21,21) nanotube fully filled with\nexperimentally observed (Ho3N)@C80 with the magnetic moment of 21 Bohr\nmagnetons.

Central to the methodology is a novel two-scale evolution\nequation. The rescaled solution of this equation is shown to provide a strong\napproximation to the actual deformation inside the peridynamic material. The\ntwo scale evolution can be split into a microscopic component tracking the\ndynamics at the length scale of the heterogeneities and a macroscopic component\ntracking the volume averaged (homogenized) dynamics. The interplay between the\nmicroscopic and macroscopic dynamics is given by a coupled system of evolution\nequations. The equations show that the forces generated by the homogenized\ndeformation inside the medium are related to the homogenized deformation\nthrough a history dependent constitutive relation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 16:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}
