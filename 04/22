The averaged field then obeys a\nLangevin-type equation into which short-scale fluctuations enter as a noise\nterm. We solve the Langevin equation for a inflaton field with Dirac Born\nInfeld (DBI) kinetic term perturbatively in the noise and use the result to\ndetermine the field value's Probability Density Function (PDF). In this\ncalculation, both the shape of the potential and the warp factor are arbitrary\nfunctions, and the PDF is obtained with and without volume effects due to the\nfinite size of the averaging domain. DBI kinetic terms typically arise in\nstring-inspired inflationary scenarios in which the scalar field is associated\nwith some distance within the (compact) extra dimensions. The inflaton's\naccessible range of field values therefore is limited because of the extra\ndimensions' finite size. We argue that in a consistent stochastic approach the\ndistance-inflaton's PDF must vanish for geometrically forbidden field values.\nWe propose to implement these extra-dimensional spatial restrictions into the\nPDF by installing absorbing (or reflecting) walls at the respective boundaries\nin field space. As a toy model, we consider a DBI inflaton between two\nabsorbing walls and use the method of images to determine its most general PDF.\nThe resulting PDF is studied in detail for the example of a quartic warp factor\nand a chaotic inflaton potential. The presence of the walls is shown to affect\nthe inflaton trajectory for a given set of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 16:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

For the purpose\nof our investigation we present models of colliding flow with plane-parallel\nand cylindrical divergence. Numerical conduction causes erroneous heating of\ngas across the contact discontinuity which has implications for the rate at\nwhich the gas cools. We find that the dynamics of the shocked gas and the\nresulting X-ray emission are strongly dependent on the contrast in the density\nand temperature either side of the contact discontinuity, these effects being\nstrongest where the postshock gas of one flow behaves quasi-adiabatically while\nthe postshock gas of the other flow is strongly radiative. Introducing\nadditional numerical viscosity into the simulations has the effect of damping\nthe growth of instabilities, which in some cases act to increase the volume of\nshocked gas and can re-heat gas via sub-shocks as it flows downstream. The\nresulting reduction in the surface area between adjacent flows, and therefore\nof the amount of numerical conduction, leads to a commensurate reduction in\nspurious X-ray emission, though the dynamics of the collision are compromised.\nThe simulation resolution also affects the degree of numerical conduction. A\nfiner resolution better resolves the interfaces of high density and temperature\ncontrast and although numerical conduction still exists the volume of affected\ngas is considerably reduced. However, since it is not always practical to\nincrease the resolution, it is imperative that the degree of numerical\nconduction is understood so that inaccurate interpretations can be avoided.\nThis work has implications for the dynamics and emission from astrophysical\nphenomena which involve high Mach number shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 17:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\nstochastic recovery specification only models the first two moments of the spot\nrecovery rate as its higher moments have almost no contribution to the loss\ndistribution and CDO tranche pricing. Observing that only the joint\ndistribution of default indicators is needed to build the portfolio loss\ndistribution, we propose a generic class of default indicator copulas to model\nCDO tranches, which can be easily calibrated to index tranche prices across\nmultiple maturities. This correlation modelling framework has the unique\nadvantage that the joint distribution of default time and other dynamic\nproperties of the model can be changed separately from the loss distribution\nand tranche prices. After calibrating the model to index tranche prices,\nexisting top-down methods can be applied to the common factor process to\nconstruct very flexible systemic dynamics without changing the already\ncalibrated tranche prices. This modelling framework therefore combines the best\nfeatures of the bottom-up and top-down models: it is fully consistent with all\nthe single name market information and it admits very rich and flexible spread\ndynamics. Numerical results from a non-parametric implementation of this\nmodelling framework are also presented. The non-parametric implementation\nachieved fast and accurate calibration to the index tranches across multiple\nmaturities even under extreme market conditions. A conditional Markov chain\nmethod is also proposed to construct the systemic dynamics, which supports an\nefficient lattice pricing method for dynamic spread instruments. We also showed\nhow to price tranche options as an example of this fast lattice method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 17:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

We also\nfind that the presence of stellar irradiation generally acts to inhibit\nfragmentation (since the discs can only cool to the temperature defined by\nstellar irradiation). However, fragmentation may occur if the irradiation is\nsufficiently weak that it allows the disc to attain a low Toomre stability\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 18:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

As single particle measurements are relatively\neasy to implement, the preparation of the resource state becomes a crucial\ntask. An appealing approach is simply to cool a strongly correlated quantum\nmany-body system to its ground state. In addition to requiring the ground state\nof the system to be universal for one-way quantum computing, we also want the\nHamiltonian to have non-degenerate ground state protected by a fixed energy\ngap, to involve only two-body interactions, and to be frustration-free so that\nmeasurements in the course of the computation leave the remaining particles in\nthe ground space. Recently, significant efforts have been made to the search of\nresource states that appear naturally as ground states in spin lattice systems.\nThe approach is proved to be successful in spin-5/2 and spin-3/2 systems. Yet,\nit remains an open question whether there could be such a natural resource\nstate in a spin-1/2, i.e., qubit system. Here, we give a negative answer to\nthis question by proving that it is impossible for a genuinely entangled qubit\nstates to be a non-degenerate ground state of any two-body frustration-free\nHamiltonian. What is more, we prove that every spin-1/2 frustration-free\nHamiltonian with two-body interaction always has a ground state that is a\nproduct of single- or two-qubit states, a stronger result that is interesting\nindependent of the context of one-way quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The inflaton then receives an anomalous dimension in the conformal\nfield theory, which leads to sequestering of all dangerous high-energy\ncorrections. We analyze a number of models where the mechanism can be seen in\naction. In our most detailed example we compute the exact anomalous dimensions\nvia a-maximization and show that the eta problem can be solved using only\nweakly-coupled physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 20:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In this paper we consider the case of the strongly\ncoupled N=4 plasma whose microscopic description, applicable for scales smaller\nthan the inverse temperature, is given in terms of gravity in an asymptotically\n$AdS_5$ space. In the gravity approximation, weak and strong shocks should be\ndescribed by smooth metrics with no discontinuities. For weak shocks we find\nthe dual metric in a derivative expansion and for strong shocks we use\nlinearized gravity to find the exponential tail that determines the width of\nthe shock. In particular we find that, when the velocity of the fluid relative\nto the shock approaches the speed of light $v\\to 1$ the penetration depth\n$\\ell$ scales as $\\ell\\sim (1-v^2)^{1/4}$.

Developing the adaptive\nMCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of\nposterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than\npreviously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional\nCVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension $3n^2 + n$, with\nsignificant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables.\nWe also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint\ninference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian\nposterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model\nparameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank.\nPractically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated\nBayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering\ninstruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets. Previously the\nliterature on financial applications of CVAR trading models typically only\nconsiders pairs trading (n=2) due to the computational cost of the griddy\nGibbs.

Large photometric and spectroscopic\ndatabases allow a re-examination of this issue. We derive median and extreme\n(90% of the distribution) colours and magnitudes of stars along the HB for\nabout a hundred GCs. We transform these into median and extreme masses of stars\non the HB taking into account evolutionary effects, and compare these masses\nwith those expected at the tip of the Red Giant Branch to derive the total mass\nlost by the stars. A simple linear dependence on metallicity of this total mass\nlost explains well the median colours of HB stars. Adopting this mass loss law\nas universal, we find that age is the main second parameter. However, at least\na third parameter is clearly required. The most likely candidate is the He\nabundance, which might be different in GCs stars belonging to the different\nstellar generations whose presence was previously derived from the Na-O and\nMg-Al anticorrelations. Variations in the median He abundance allow explaining\nthe extremely blue HB of some GCs; such variations are correlated with the\nR-parameter. Suitable He abundances allow deriving ages from the HB which are\nconsistent with those obtained from the Main Sequence. Small corrections to\nthese latter ages are then proposed, producing a tight age-metallicity relation\nfor disk and bulge GCs. Star-to-star variations in the He content explain the\nextension of the HB. There is a strong correlation between this extension and\nthe interquartile of the Na-O anticorrelation. The main driver for the\nvariations in the He-content within GCs seems the total cluster mass. 47 Tuc\nand M3 exhibit exceptional behaviours; however, they can be accommodated in a\nscenario for the formation of GCs that relates their origin to cooling flows\ngenerated after very large episodes of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 08:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 10:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

Studies of their 2D physical properties are still lacking. We aim to\nunderstand the nature and origin of the ionization mechanisms operating in the\nextranuclear regions of LIRGs as a function of the interaction phase and L_IR\nby using IFS data obtained with VIMOS. Our analysis is based on over 25300\nspectra of 32 LIRGs covering all types of morphologies and the entire\n10^11-10^12 L_sun range. We found strong evidence for shock ionization, with a\nclear trend with the dynamical status of the system. Specifically, we\nquantified the variation with interaction phase of several line ratios\nindicative of the excitation degree. While the [NII]/Ha ratio does not show any\nsignificant change, the [SII]/Ha and [OI]/Ha ratios are higher for more\nadvanced interaction stages. We constrained the main mechanisms causing the\nionization in the extra-nuclear regions using diagnostic diagrams. Isolated\nsystems are mainly consistent with ionization caused by young stars. Large\nfractions of the extra-nuclear regions in interacting pairs and more advanced\nmergers are consistent with ionization caused by shocks. This is supported by\nthe relation between the excitation degree and the velocity dispersion of the\nionized gas, which we interpret as evidence for shock ionization in interacting\ngalaxies and advanced mergers but not in isolated galaxies. This relation does\nnot show any dependence with L_IR. All this indicates that tidal forces play a\nkey role in the origin of the ionizing shocks in the extra-nuclear regions. We\nalso showed what appears to be a common [OI]/Ha-sigma relation for the\nextranuclear ionized gas in interacting (U)LIRGs. This needs to be investigated\nfurther with a larger sample of ULIRGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 14:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In addition to\ncurrent species-specific analyses, allometry facilitates understanding of limit\ncycles amongst different species. So far, body-size regressions have been\nderived for the oscillation period of the population densities of warm-blooded\nspecies, in particular herbivores. Here, we extend the allometric analysis to\nother clades, allowing for a comparison between the obtained slopes and\nintercepts. The oscillation periods were derived from databases and original\nstudies to cover a broad range of conditions and species. Then, values were\nrelated to specific body size by regression analysis. For different groups of\nherbivorous species, the oscillation period increased as a function of\nindividual mass as a power law with exponents of 0.11-0.27. The intercepts of\nthe resulting linear regressions indicated that cycle times for equally-sized\nspecies increased from homeotherms up to invertebrates. Overall, cycle times\nfor predators did not scale to body size. Implications for these differences\nwere addressed in the light of intra- and interspecific delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 15:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-23"}
