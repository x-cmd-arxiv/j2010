Here we examine and advance a theory as to how condensation\ninfluences atmospheric pressure through the mass removal of water from the gas\nphase with a simultaneous account of the latent heat release. Building from the\nfundamental physical principles we show that condensation is associated with a\ndecline in air pressure in the lower atmosphere. This decline occurs up to a\ncertain height, which ranges from 3 to 4 km for surface temperatures from 10 to\n30 deg C. We then estimate the horizontal pressure differences associated with\nwater vapor condensation and find that these are comparable in magnitude with\nthe pressure differences driving observed circulation patterns. The water vapor\ndelivered to the atmosphere via evaporation represents a store of potential\nenergy available to accelerate air and thus drive winds. Our estimates suggest\nthat the global mean power at which this potential energy is released by\ncondensation is around one per cent of the global solar power -- this is\nsimilar to the known stationary dissipative power of general atmospheric\ncirculation. We conclude that condensation and evaporation merit attention as\nmajor, if previously overlooked, factors in driving atmospheric dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 16:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Cepheid models indicate that the slope of the Period-Luminosity\n(P-L) relation covering the entire period range (0.40<= logP <=2.0) becomes\nsteeper when moving from optical to NIR bands, and that the metallicity\ndependence of the slope decreases from the B- to the K-band. We estimated V-\nand I-band slopes for 87 Cepheid data sets belonging to 48 external galaxies\nwith nebular oxygen abundance 7.5<= 12+log (O/H) <=8.9. By using Cepheid\nsamples including more than 20 Cepheids, the chi^2 test indicates that the\nhypothesis of a steepening of the P-L_{V,I} relations with increased\nmetallicity can be discarded at the 99% level. On the contrary, the observed\nslopes agree with the metallicity trend predicted by pulsation models, i.e. the\nslope is roughly constant for galaxies with 12+log (O/H) < 8.17 and becomes\nshallower in the metal-rich regime, with a confidence level of 62% and 92%,\nrespectively. The chi^2 test concerning the hypothesis that the slope does not\ndepend on metallicity gives confidence levels either similar (P-L_V, 62%) or\nsmaller (P-L_I, 67%). We found that the slopes of optical and NIR\nPeriod-Wesenheit (P-W) relations in external galaxies are similar to the slopes\nof LMC. On this ground, the P-W relations provide robust distances relative to\nthe LMC, but theory and observations indicate that the metallicity dependence\nof the zero-point in the different passbands has to be taken into account. We\ncompared the galaxy distances provided by Rizzi et al. (2007) using the TRGB\nwith our set of Cepheid distances based on the P-W relations. We found that the\nmetallicity correction on distances based on the P-WBV relation is\ngamma_(B,V)=-0.52 mag dex^-1, whereas it is vanishing for the distances based\non the P-WVI and on the P-WJK relations.

Each vertex of the network of interactions\nis characterized by a set of $F$ cultural features, each of which can assume\n$q$ states. Pairs of adjacent vertices interact at a rate proportional to the\nnumber of features they share, which results in the interacting pair having one\nmore cultural feature in common. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied\nduring the past ten years, based on numerical simulations and simple mean-field\ntreatments, while there is a total lack of analytical results for the spatial\nmodel itself. Simulation results for the one-dimensional system led physicists\nto formulate the following conjectures. When the number of features $F$ and the\nnumber of states $q$ both equal two, or when the number of features exceeds the\nnumber of states, the system converges to a monocultural equilibrium in the\nsense that the number of cultural domains rescaled by the population size\nconverges to zero as the population goes to infinity. In contrast, when the\nnumber of states exceeds the number of features, the system freezes in a highly\nfragmented configuration in which the ultimate number of cultural domains\nscales like the population size. In this article, we prove analytically for the\none-dimensional system convergence to a monocultural equilibrium in terms of\nclustering when $F=q=2$, as well as fixation to a highly fragmented\nconfiguration when the number of states is sufficiently larger than the number\nof features.

The gravity\ndual at zero temperature captures the logarithmic runnings of the coupling\nconstants at far IR and the almost conformal, albeit strongly coupled, behavior\nat the UV. The full UV completion of gauge theory is accomplished in the\ngravity side by attaching an AdS cap to the IR geometry described in our\nprevious work. Attaching such an AdS cap is highly non-trivial because it\namounts to finding the right interpolating geometry and sources that take us\nfrom a gravity solution with non-zero three-form fluxes to another one that has\nalmost vanishing three-form fluxes. In this paper we give a concrete\nrealisation of such a scenario, completing the program advocated in our earlier\npaper. One of the main advantage of having such a background, in addition to\nproviding a dual description of the required gauge theory, is the absence of\nLandau poles and consequently the UV divergences of the Wilson loops. The\npotential for the heaviest fundamental quark anti-quark pairs, which are like\nthe heavy quarkonium states in realistic QCD, can be computed and their linear\nbehavior at large separations and zero temperature could be demonstrated. At\nsmall separations the expected Coulombic behavior appears to dominate.

We\nfind the four knots cospatial with the dusty disk to be young, of order 10^7 yr\nold. The FUV emission in the nucleus is likely due to an episode of star\nformation triggered ~10^9 yr ago. We argue that the young 10^7 yr old knots\nstem from an episode of star formation that was roughly coeval with the event\nresulting in reignition of radio activity, creating the CSS source. The 10^9 yr\nold stars in the nucleus may be associated with the previous epoch of activity\nthat generated the 4 Mpc relic source, before it was cut off by exhaustion or\ninterruption. The ages of the knots, considered in context with the disturbed\nmorphology of the nuclear dust and the double-double morphology of the \"old\"\nand \"young\" radio sources, present evidence for an episodic AGN/starburst\nconnection. We suggest that the AGN fuel supply was interrupted for ~10^7 yr\ndue to a minor merger event and has now been restored, and the resultant\nnon-steady flow of gas toward the nucleus is likely responsible for both the\nnew episode of infall-induced star formation and also the multiple epochs of\nradio activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 20:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

If the correlation of two variables\nis weak (Pearson's correlation coefficient $|\\rho| <1/3 $), the\nFarlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula provides an intuitive and natural way\nfor constructing such a bivariate DF. When the linear correlation is stronger,\nthe FGM copula cannot work anymore.

Using the copulas, we\nconstructed the BLFs and discuss its statistical properties. Especially, we\nfocused on the FUV--FIR BLF, since these two luminosities are related to the\nstar formation (SF) activity.

In the letter we\npresented an analytical conclusion that the competition ability was linearly\ndependent on the uniqueness in the trivial cases, where both the \"input\nquality\" and \"competition gain\" obey normal distributions. The competition\nbetween Chinese regional universities was taken as examples. In this article we\ndiscuss the abnormal cases where competition gains show the distributions near\nto power laws. In addition, we extend the study onto all the\ncooperation-competition bipartite networks and therefore redefine the\ncompetition ability. The empirical investigation of the competition ability\ndependence on the uniqueness in 15 real world collaboration-competition systems\nis presented, 14 of which belong to the general nontrivial cases. We find that\nthe dependence generally follows the so-called \"shifted power law (SPL)\", but\nvery near to power laws. The empirically obtained heterogeneity indexes of the\ndistributions of competition ability and uniqueness are also presented. These\nempirical investigations will be used as a supplementary of a future paper,\nwhich will present the comparison and further discussions about the competition\nability dependence on the uniqueness in the abnormal collaboration-competition\nsystems and the relationship between the dependence and the competition ability\nand uniqueness heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2010 15:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 03:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-07"}

A special role is played by a particular\nunitary extension, called the central or universal unitary extension. The\ncoefficient matrix for the Redheffer linear-fractional map has a simple\nexpression in terms of the universal unitary extension. The universal unitary\nextension can be seen as a unitary coupling of four unitary operators (two\nbilateral shift operators together with two unitary operators coming from the\nproblem data) which has special geometric structure. We use this special\ngeometric structure to obtain an inverse theorem (Theorem 8.4 as well as\nTheorem 9.3) which characterizes the coefficient matrices for a Redheffer\nlinear-fractional map arising in this way from a lifting problem. When\nexpressed in terms of Hellinger-space functional models (Theorem 10.3), these\nresults lead to generalizations of classical results of Arov and to\ncharacterizations of the coefficient matrix-measures of the lifting problem in\nterms of the density properties of the corresponding model spaces. The main\ntool is the formalism of unitary scattering systems developed in [18], [45].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2010 15:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
