Our approach\nrelies on the use of topological string theory techniques.

To\nconstrain the physical conditions in the circumstellar envelope, multiple\nrotational CO emission lines were modeled using a non local thermodynamic\nequilibrium radiative transfer code.

The interaction of\nvery-high-energy (VHE: E>100 GeV) gamma-rays, emitted by sources located at\ncosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron\npair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE\nflux. This introduces a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of measured\nVHE gamma-ray spectra: neither the intrinsic spectrum, nor the EBL, are\nseparately known -- only their combination is. In this paper we propose a\nmethod to measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using\nsimultaneous observations of BL Lac objects in the optical, X-ray, high-energy\n(HE: E>100 MeV) gamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from\nCherenkov telescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the\nlatter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a\nSynchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model. We extrapolate such best-fitting models\ninto the VHE regime, and assume they represent the BL Lacs' intrinsic emission.\nContrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the\nphoton-photon opacity to VHE photons. Using, for each given source, different\nstates of emission will only improve the accuracy of the proposed method.

SDSS spectra probably miss\nthese features due to small fiber size. UV-excess early-type galaxies have on\naverage less dust and larger UV sizes (D>40 kpc) than other green-valley\ngalaxies, which argues for an external origin for the gas that is driving the\nSF. Thus, most of these galaxies appear `rejuvenated' (e.g., through minor\ngas-rich mergers or IGM accretion). For a smaller subset of the sample, the\ndeclining SF (from the original internal gas) cannot be ruled out. SF is rare\nin very massive early-types (M_* > 10^11 M_sun), a possible consequence of AGN\nfeedback.

However, radio waves with kHz, Hz, and even\nlower frequencies may propagate through the intergalactic medium (IGM). I argue\nthat the presence of these waves can be inferred by using the Universe as our\ndetector. I discuss possible sub-MHz sources and set new non-trivial upper\nlimits on the energy density of sub-MHz radio waves in galaxy clusters and the\naverage cosmic background. Limits based on five effects are considered: (1)\nchanges in the expansion of the Universe from the radiation energy density (2)\nheating of the IGM by free-free absorption; (3) radiation pressure squeezing of\nIGM clouds by external radio waves; (4) synchrotron heating of electrons in\nclusters; and (5) Inverse Compton upscattering of sub-MHz radio photons. Any\nsub-MHz background must have an energy density much smaller than the CMB at\nfrequencies below 1 MHz. The free-free absorption bounds from the Lyman-alpha\nforest are potentially the strongest, but are highly dependent on the\nproperties of sub-MHz radio scattering in the IGM. I estimate an upper limit of\n6 * 10^4 L_sun Mpc^-3 for the emissivity within Lyman-alpha forest clouds in\nthe frequency range 5 - 200 Hz. The sub-MHz energy density in the Coma cluster\nis constrained to be less than ~10^-15 erg cm^-3.

In this paper\nwe estimate the effect of gravitational lensing by galaxies and their\nsurrounding mass distributions on the statistics of Mg-II absorption. We find\nthat the multi-band magnification bias could be very strong in the\nspectroscopic GRB afterglow population and that gravitational lensing can\nexplain the discrepancy in density of absorbers, for plausibly steep luminosity\nfunctions. The model makes the prediction that approximately 20%-60% of the\nspectroscopic afterglow sample (i.e. ~ 5-15 of 26 sources) would have been\nmultiply imaged, and hence result in repeating bursts. We show that despite\nthis large lensing fraction it is likely that none would yet have been\nidentified by chance owing to the finite sky coverage of GRB searches. We\npredict that continued optical monitoring of the bright GRB afterglow locations\nin the months and years following the initial decay would lead to\nidentification of lensed GRB afterglows.

It is known that the coupling of the magnetic\nfield between hemispheres due to turbulent diffusivity is an important factor\nfor the solar parity issue, but the detailed criterion for the generation of\nthe dipole field has not been investigated. Our conclusions are as follows. (1)\nThe stronger diffusivity near the surface is more likely to cause the magnetic\nfield to be a dipole. (2) The thinner layer of the strong diffusivity near the\nsurface is also more apt to generate a dipolar magnetic field. (3) The faster\nmeridional flow is more prone to cause the magnetic field to be a quadrupole,\ni.e., symmetric about the equator.

METHODS: Very High Energy\n(VHE; E > 100 GeV) observations of H 2356-309 were performed with the High\nEnergy Stereoscopic System (HESS) from 2004 through 2007. Simultaneous\noptical/UV and X-ray observations were made with the XMM-Newton satellite on\nJune 12/13 and June 14/15, 2005. NRT radio observations were also\ncontemporaneously performed in 2005. ATOM optical monitoring observations were\nalso made in 2007. RESULTS: A strong VHE signal, ~13 sigma total, was detected\nby HESS after the four years HESS observations (116.8 hrs live time). The\nintegral flux above 240 GeV is I(>240 GeV) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61\n{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observed\nfrom the Crab Nebula. A time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 GeV\nto 2 TeV and is characterized by a power law (photon index of Gamma = 3.06 +-\n0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). Significant small-amplitude variations in the VHE\nflux from H 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not on\nshorter time scales. No evidence for any variations in the VHE spectral slope\nare found within these data. The XMM-Newton X-ray measurements show a\nhistorically low X-ray state, characterized by a hard, broken-power-law\nspectrum on both nights. CONCLUSIONS: The broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the blazar can be adequately fit using a simple one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. In the SSC scenario, higher VHE fluxes\ncould be expected in the future since the observed X-ray flux is at a\nhistorically low level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 01:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 23:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\nobserved clouds exhibit scaling relations that are similar to those determined\nfor Galactic GMCs, although LMC clouds have narrower linewidths and lower CO\nluminosities than Galactic clouds of a similar size.

We compare the properties of GMCs with\nestimates for local interstellar conditions: specifically, we investigate the\nHI column density, radiation field, stellar mass surface density and the\nexternal pressure. Very few cloud properties demonstrate a clear dependence on\nthe environment; the exceptions are significant positive correlations between\ni) the HI column density and the GMC velocity dispersion, ii) the stellar mass\nsurface density and the average peak CO brightness, and iii) the stellar mass\nsurface density and the CO surface brightness. The molecular mass surface\ndensity of GMCs without signs of massive star formation shows no dependence on\nthe local radiation field, which is inconsistent with the\nphotoionization-regulated star formation theory proposed by McKee (1989). We\nfind some evidence that the mass surface density of the MAGMA clouds increases\nwith the interstellar pressure, as proposed by Elmegreen (1989), but the\ndetailed predictions of this model are not fulfilled once estimates for the\nlocal radiation field, metallicity and GMC envelope mass are taken into\naccount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 02:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

These findings are based on a deep\noptical rest-frame spectrum obtained with the Multi-Object InfraRed Camera and\nSpectrograph (MOIRCS) on the Subaru telescope of a high-z passive galaxy\ncandidate (pBzK) from the COSMOS field, for which we accurately measure its\nredshift of z=1.8230 and obtain an upper limit on its velocity dispersion\nsigma_star<326 km/s. By detailed stellar population modeling of both the galaxy\nbroad-band SED and the rest-frame optical spectrum we derive a\nstar-formation-weighted age and formation redshift of t_sf~1-2 Gyr and\nz_form~2.5-4, and a stellar mass of M_star~(3-4)x10^{11} M_sun. This is in\nagreement with a virial mass limit of M_vir<7x10^{11}M_sun, derived from the\nmeasured sigma_star value and stellar half-light radius, as well as with the\ndynamical mass limit based on the Jeans equations. In contrast with previously\nreported super-dense passive galaxies at z~2, the present galaxy at z=1.82\nappears to have both size and velocity dispersion similar to early-type\ngalaxies in the local Universe with similar stellar mass. This suggests that\nz~2 massive and passive galaxies may exhibit a wide range of properties, then\npossibly following quite different evolutionary histories from z~2 to z=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 08:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlated\nwith non-thermal X-rays. Because the thickness of the VHE-shell is compatible\nwith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likely\nto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal.

Such single trajectory ensemble (STE) is a counterpart to a multiple\ntrajectory ensemble (MTE) used whenever independent measurements or\nrealizations of a stochastic process are available. The equivalence of STE and\nMTE for stationary systems was postulated by Wang and Uhlenbeck in their\nclassic paper on Brownian motion (Rev. Mod. Phys. 17, 323 (1945)) but\nsurprisingly has not yet been proved. Using the stationary and ergodic paradigm\nof statistical physics -- the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Langevin equation, we\nrevisit Wang and Uhlenbeck's postulate. In particular, we find that the\nvariance of the solution of this equation is different for these two ensembles.\nWhile the variance calculated using the MTE quantifies the spreading of\nindependent trajectories originating from the same initial point, the variance\nfor STE measures the spreading of two correlated random walkers.

From the point of\nview of the narrow emission line spectrum, the source locates close to\nlow-excitation radio galaxies.

Difference imaging methods, originally\npioneered towards M31, have evolved into sophisticated methods, such as the\nOptimal Image Subtraction (OIS) method of Alard & Lupton (1998), that today are\nmost widely used to survey variable stars, transients and microlensing events\nin our own Galaxy. We show that modern difference image (DIA) algorithms such\nas OIS, whilst spectacularly successful towards the Milky Way bulge, may\nperform badly towards high surface brightness targets such as the M31 bulge.\nPoor results can occur in the presence of common systematics which add spurious\nflux contributions to images, such as internal reflections, scattered light or\nfringing. Using data from the Angstrom Project microlensing survey of the M31\nbulge, we show that very good results are usually obtainable by first\nperforming careful photometric alignment prior to using OIS to perform\npoint-spread function (PSF) matching. This separation of background matching\nand PSF matching, a common feature of earlier M31 photometry techniques, allows\nus to take full advantage of the powerful PSF matching flexibility offered by\nOIS towards high surface brightness targets. We find that difference images\nproduced this way have noise distributions close to Gaussian, showing\nsignificant improvement upon results achieved using OIS alone. We show that\nwith this correction light-curves of variable stars and transients can be\nrecovered to within ~10 arcseconds of the M31 nucleus.

However, while the square lattice process maps to the collapse\ntransition of the canonical interacting self-avoiding trail model (ISAT) on\nthat lattice, the process on the triangular lattice model does not map to the\ncanonical equilibrium model. On the other hand, we show that the collapse\ntransition of the canonical ISAT model on the triangular lattice behaves in a\nway reminiscent of the $\\theta$-point of the interacting self-avoiding walk\nmodel (ISAW), which is the standard model of polymer collapse. This implies an\nunusual lattice dependency of the ISAT collapse transition in two dimensions.\n  By studying an extended ISAT model, we demonstrate that the growth process\nmaps to a multi-critical point in a larger parameter space. In this extended\nparameter space the collapse phase transition may be either $\\theta$-point-like\n(second-order) or first-order, and these two are separated by a multi-critical\npoint. It is this multi-critical point to which the growth process maps.\nFurthermore, we provide evidence that in addition to the high-temperature\ngas-like swollen polymer phase (coil) and the low-temperature liquid drop-like\ncollapse phase (globule) there is also a maximally dense crystal-like phase\n(crystal) at low temperatures dependent on the parameter values.

We group the strongest Fe II multiplets into three groups according to\nthe lower term of the transition (b $^4$F, a $^6$S and a $^4$G terms). These\ncorrespond approximately to the blue, central, and red part respectively of the\n\"iron shelf\" around Hb. We calculate an Fe II template which takes into account\ntransitions into these three terms and an additional group of lines, based on a\nreconstruction of the spectrum of I Zw 1. This Fe II template gives a more\nprecise fit of the Fe II lines in broad-line AGNs than other templates. We\nextract Fe II, Ha, Hb, [O III] and [N II] emission parameters and investigate\ncorrelations between them. We find that Fe II lines probably originate in an\nIntermediate Line Region. We notice that the blue, red, and central parts of\nthe iron shelf have different relative intensities in different objects. Their\nratios depend on continuum luminosity, FWHM Hb, the velocity shift of Fe II,\nand the Ha/Hb flux ratio. We examine the dependence of the well-known\nanti-correlation between the equivalent widths of Fe II and [O III] on\ncontinuum luminosity. We find that there is a Baldwin effect for [O III] but an\ninverse Baldwin effect for the Fe II emission. The [O III]/Fe II ratio thus\ndecreases with L\\lambda5100. Since the ratio is a major component of the\nBoroson and Green eigenvector 1, this implies a connection between the Baldwin\neffect and eigenvector 1, and could be connected with AGN evolution. We find\nthat spectra are different for Hb FWHMs greater and less than ~3000 km/s, and\nthat there are different correlation coefficients between the parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 15:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 15:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Emission is extended over each\nsource, following the column density of H2 but showing up also particularly\nstrongly around outflows. The rotational temperature is low, 15-20 K, and does\nnot vary with position within each source. The abundance is typically 10^-9 -\n10^-8 with respect to H2 in the outer envelope, whereas \"jumps\" by factors of\nup to 10^2 -10^3 inside the region where the dust temperature exceeds 100 K are\nnot excluded. A factor of up to ~ 10^3 enhancement is seen in outflow gas. In\none object, SMM4, the ice abundance has been measured to be ~ 3x10^-5 with\nrespect to H2 in the outer envelope, i.e., a factor of 10^3 larger than the\ngas-phase abundance. Comparison with C18O J=3-2 emission shows that strong CO\ndepletion leads to a high gas-phase abundance of CH3OH not just for the Serpens\nsources, but for a larger sample of protostars. The observations illustrate the\nlarge-scale, low-level desorption of CH3OH from dust grains, extending out to\nand beyond 7500 AU from each source, a scenario which is consistent with\nnon-thermal (photo-)desorption from the ice. The observations also illustrate\nthe usefulness of CH3OH as a tracer of energetic input in the form of outflows,\nwhere methanol is sputtered from the grain surfaces. Finally, the observations\nprovide further evidence of CH3OH formation through CO hydrogenation proceeding\non grain surfaces in low-mass envelopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 15:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
