The magnitude of this ISOC is about $0.46meV$, 100 times\nlarger than that of the monolayer graphene. The Hamiltonians including this\nISOC in both momentum and real spaces are derived.

For the first time the analysis is performed in 4 different\nX-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flare\ntemporal properties with energy. We find that flares are narrower at higher\nenergies: their width follows a power-law relation w~E^{-0.5} reminiscent of\nthe prompt emission. Flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time which\nis twice the rise time on average. Both time scales linearly evolve with time,\ngiving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both time\nscales are stretched by the same factor. As a consequence, the flare width\nlinearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearly\ndistinguishes the flare from the GRB prompt emission. The flare 0.3-10 keV peak\nluminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with large\nscatter: L_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. When multiple flares are present, a global\nsoftening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than the\nprevious one. The 0.3-10 keV isotropic energy distribution is a log-normal\npeaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. The flare\naverage spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to be a power-law with\nspectral energy index beta~1.1. These results confirmed that the flares are\ntightly linked to the prompt emission. However, after considering various\nmodels we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entire\nset of observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 17:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Using the standard approach to incorporate electron\nscreening through the one-loop polarization function, we show that the magnetic\nfield produces important corrections both at short and long distances. In\nextreme fields, realized in highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars,\nelectrons occupy only the lowest Landau levels in the relatively low density\nregion of the crust. Here our results show that the screening length for\nCoulomb interactions between ions can be smaller than the inter-ion spacing.\nMore interestingly, we find that the screening is anisotropic and the screened\npotential between two static charges exhibits long range Friedel oscillations\nparallel to the magnetic field. This long-range oscillatory behavior is likely\nto affect the lattice structure of ions, and can possibly create rod-like\nstructures in the magnetar crusts. We also calculate the imaginary part of the\nelectron polarization function which determines the spectrum of electron-hole\nexcitations and plays a role in damping lattice phonon excitations. We\ndemonstrate that even for modest magnetic fields this damping is highly\nanisotropic and will likely lead to anisotropic phonon heat transport in the\nouter neutron star crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 18:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

The mid-IR spectrum is dominated by\nemission from ~180 K silicate dust, collisionally-heated by the hot X-ray\nemitting gas with a temperature and density of ~5x10^6 K and 3x10^4 cm-3,\nrespectively.

We first computed ${\\lambda_2}$ for\nseveral one and two dimensional Ising models, which have a discrete phase\nspace, and compared the relative efficiencies of the Metropolis and heat-bath\nalgorithms as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Next, we\ncomputed $\\lambda_2$ for a model of an interacting gas trapped by a harmonic\npotential, which has a mutidimensional continuous phase space, and studied the\nefficiency of the Metropolis algorithm as a function of temperature and the\nmaximum allowable step size $\\Delta$. Based on the $\\lambda_2$ criterion, we\nfound for the Ising models that small lattices appear to give an adequate\npicture of comparative efficiency and that the heat-bath algorithm is more\nefficient than the Metropolis algorithm only at low temperatures where both\nalgorithms are inefficient. For the harmonic trap problem, we found that the\ntraditional rule-of-thumb of adjusting $\\Delta$ so the Metropolis acceptance\nrate is around 50% range is often sub-optimal. In general, as a function of\ntemperature or $\\Delta$, $\\lambda_2$ for this model displayed trends defining\noptimal efficiency that the acceptance ratio does not. The cases studied also\nsuggested that Monte Carlo simulations for a continuum model are likely more\nefficient than those for a discretized version of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 19:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

It is natural for the heavier states to be\ncosmologically long-lived and to make up an O(1) fraction of the dark matter.\nDirect detection rates are dominated by the exothermic reactions in which an\nexcited dark matter state down-scatters off of a nucleus, becoming a lower\nenergy state.

The RFI can then be canceled from the\nastronomy signal paths. However, astronomers typically only require signal\nstatistics. If the RFI statistics are changing slowly, the cancellation can be\napplied to the signal correlations at a much lower rate than is required for\nstandard adaptive filters. In this paper we describe five canceler setups;\nprecorrelation and postcorrelation cancelers that use one or two reference\nsignals in different ways. The theoretical residual RFI and added noise levels\nare examined and are demonstrated using microwave television RFI at the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array. The RFI is attenuated to below the system\nnoise, a reduction of at least 20 dB. While dual-reference cancelers add more\nreference noise than single-reference cancelers, this noise is zero-mean and\nonly adds to the system noise, decreasing the sensitivity. The residual RFI\nthat remains in the output of single-reference cancelers (but not\ndual-reference cancelers) sets a nonzero noise floor that does not act like\nrandom system noise and may limit the achievable sensitivity. Thus,\ndual-reference cancelers often result in superior cancellation. Dual-reference\nprecorrelation cancelers require a double-canceler setup to be useful and to\ngive equivalent results to dual-reference postcorrelation cancelers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 19:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The photometric catalog consists of stars\nwith infrared counterparts in the Spitzer, SAGE-SMC survey database, for which\nwe present uniform photometry from 0.3-24 um in the UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24 bands.\nWe compare the color magnitude diagrams and color-color diagrams to those of\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), finding that the brightest infrared sources\nin the SMC are also the red supergiants, supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars,\nluminous blue variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars, with the latter exhibiting less\ninfrared excess, the red supergiants being less dusty and the sgB[e] stars\nbeing on average less luminous. Among the objects detected at 24 um are a few\nvery luminous hypergiants, 4 B-type stars with peculiar, flat spectral energy\ndistributions, and all 3 known luminous blue variables. We detect a distinct Be\nstar sequence, displaced to the red, and suggest a novel method of confirming\nBe star candidates photometrically. We find a higher fraction of Oe and Be\nstars among O and early-B stars in the SMC, respectively, when compared to the\nLMC, and that the SMC Be stars occur at higher luminosities.

We find a new\nmagnetic acceleration mechanism for such impulsive flows that can be much more\neffective than the acceleration of steady-state flows. This impulsive\nacceleration results in kinetic-energy-dominated flows at astrophysically\nrelevant distances from the central source. For a spherical flow, a discrete\nshell ejected from the source over a time t_0 with Lorentz factor Gamma~1 and\ninitial magnetization sigma_0 = B_0^2/(4 pi rho_0 c^2) >> 1 quickly reaches a\ntypical Lorentz factor Gamma ~ sigma_0^{1/3} and magnetization sigma ~\nsigma_0^{2/3} at the distance R_0 ~ ct_0. At this point the magnetized shell of\nwidth Delta ~ R_0 in the lab frame loses causal contact with the source and\ncontinues to accelerate by spreading significantly in its own rest frame. The\nexpansion is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient and leads to relativistic\nrelative velocities between the front and back of the shell. While the\nexpansion is roughly symmetric in the center of momentum frame, in the lab\nframe most of the energy and momentum remain in a region (or shell) of width\nDelta ~ R_0 at the head of the flow. This acceleration proceeds as Gamma ~\n(sigma_0 R/R_0)^{1/3} and sigma ~ sigma_0^{2/3} (R/R_0)^{-1/3} until reaching a\ncoasting radius R_c ~ R_0 sigma_0^2 where the kinetic energy becomes dominant:\nGamma ~ sigma_0 and sigma ~ 1 at R_c. Then the shell starts coasting and\nspreading (radially) causing its magnetization to drop as sigma ~ R_c/R at\nR>R_c. Given the typical variability time-scales of AGN and GRBs, the magnetic\nacceleration in these sources is a combination of the quasi-steady-state\ncollimation acceleration close to the source and the impulsive acceleration\nfurther out. The interaction with the external medium is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 20:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 02:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 03:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For high-latitude stars the ratios Mg/Si\nand Fe/Si in dust are close to 1.5. For disk stars they are reduced to ${\\rm\nMg/Si} \\sim 1.2$ and ${\\rm Fe/Si} \\sim 1.05$.

We assume a\nstate-dependent communication model over this topology: communication is\nMarkovian with respect to the states of the agents and the probability with\nwhich the links are available depends on the states of the agents. In this\npaper, we study a projected multi-agent subgradient algorithm under\nstate-dependent communication.

In the 0.5 - 4AU, when the eccentricities of\nplanetesimals are excited, planetesimals are able to accrete material from wide\nradial direction. The plenty of water material of the terrestrial planet in the\nHabitable Zone may be transferred from the farther places by this mechanism.\nAccretion may also happen a few times between two giant planets only if the\nouter planet has a moderate mass and the small terrestrial planet could survive\nat some resonances over time scale of $10^8$ yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 04:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-09"}

To show\nsuperiority of the IMP algorithm, we compare it with the closely related\nexpectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm and a number of other matrix\ncompletion algorithms. Our simulation results on Netflix data show that, while\nthe methods perform similarly with large amounts of data, the IMP algorithm is\nsuperior for small amounts of data. This improves the cold-start problem of the\nCF systems in practice. Another advantage of the IMP algorithm is that it can\nbe analyzed using the technique of density evolution (DE) that was originally\ndeveloped for MP decoding of error-correcting codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 05:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-08"}

Each such enhancer activates a neighboring gene at a unique threshold\nconcentration of Dorsal. The presence of Dorsal binding site clusters in these\nenhancers and of similar clusters in other enhancers has motivated models of\nthreshold-encoding in site density. However, we found that the precise length\nof a spacer separating a pair of specialized Dorsal and Twist binding sites\ndetermines the threshold-response. Despite this result, the functional range\ndetermined by this spacer element as well as the role and origin of its\nsurrounding Dorsal site cluster remained completely unknown. Here, we\nexperiment with enhancers from diverse Drosophila genomes, including the large\nuncompacted genomes from ananassae and willistoni, and report three major\ninterdependent results. First, we map the functional range of the\nthreshold-encoding spacer variable. Second, we show that the majority of sites\nat the cluster are non-functional divergent elements that have been separated\nbeyond the encoding's functional range. Third, we verify an evolutionary model\ninvolving the frequent replacement of a threshold encoding, whose precision is\neasily outdated by shifting accuracy. The process by which encodings are\nreplaced by newer ones is facilitated by the palindromic nature of the Dorsal\nand Twist binding motifs and by intrinsic repeat-instability in the specialized\nTwist binding site, which critically impacts the length of the spacer linking\nit to Dorsal. Over time, the dynamic process of selective deprecation and\nreplacement of encodings adds to a growing cluster of deadened elements, or\nnecro-elements, and strongly biases local sequence composition. ...

For a certain choice of the coupling constants, our\nmodel exhibits three exotic valence-bond phases (herringbone, checkerboard and\n'dimer smectic') in the ground state, which meet at a triple point. The\ncheckerboard phase has four-fold rotational symmetry, while the dimer smectic\nis characterized by partial ordering only in one of the two directions. In the\ndimer smectic phase, we investigate the dimer-dimer correlation by using an\nanalogy to random walks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 09:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 14:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 May 2011 03:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

We\ninvestigate whether or not the growth rates and eigenfunctions found in the\nlinear analysis are consistent with the results of non-linear numerical\nsimulations. Following the linear analysis of Rheinhardt & Geppert, we study\nthe same cases for which the Hall instability was predicted by solving the\nnon-linear Hall induction equation using a two-dimensional conservative and\ndivergence-free finite difference scheme that overcomes intrinsic difficulties\nof pseudo-spectral methods and can describe situations with arbitrarily high\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers. We show that unstable modes can grow to the level of\nthe background field without being overwhelmed by the Hall cascade, and cause a\ncomplete rearrangement of the field geometry. We confirm both the growth rates\nand eigenfunctions found in the linearized analysis and hence the instability.\nIn the non-linear regime, after the unstable modes grow to the background\nlevel, the naturally selected modes become stable and oscillatory. Later on,\nthe evolution tends to select the modes with the longest possible wavelengths,\nbut this process occurs on the magnetic diffusion timescale. We confirm the\nexistence of the Hall instability. We argue against using the misleading\nterminology that associates the non-linear Hall term with a turbulent Hall\ncascade, since small-scale structures are not created everywhere. The field\nevolves instead in a Burgers-like manner, forms local structures with strong\ngradients which become shocks in the zero resistivity limit, and Hall waves are\nlaunched and propagated through the entire domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 11:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

This\nexpected entropy reduction is exactly the (expected) TEB, which can be\nexpressed by a closed-form formula and act as a consistent and unbiased\ncorrection. TEB indicates that the entropy of a specific sampling distribution\nshould be increased accordingly. This entails a quantitative re-interpretation\nof the Maxent principle. By compensating TEB and meanwhile forcing the\nresulting distribution to be close to the sampling distribution, our\ngeneralized TEBC Maxent can be expected to alleviate the overfitting and\nunderfitting. We also present a connection between TEB and Lidstone estimator.\nAs a result, TEB-Lidstone estimator is developed by analytically identifying\nthe rate of probability correction in Lidstone. Extensive empirical evaluation\nshows promising performance of both TEBC Maxent and TEB-Lidstone in comparison\nwith various state-of-the-art density estimation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 11:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-08"}

Extragalactic magnetic fields alter the\ntrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic background\nphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse Compton scattering. These secondary\nphotons can form an extended halo around bright VHE sources.\n  Aims: We searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars Mrk 421\nand Mrk 501 using the MAGIC telescope data.\n  Methods: If extended emission is present, the angular distribution of\nreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader than\nfor a point-like source.

Delocalized superconductive\npairing (superconductivity) is achieved by a Feshbach resonance of two unpaired\nholes (electrons) resonating with a virtual energy level of the bound pair\nstate of the local \"boson\" as described by the Boson-Fermion-Gossamer (BFG)\nmodel. The spin-charge order interaction offers an explanation for the overall\nshape of the superconducting dome as well a microscopic basis for the cuprate\nsuperconducting transition temperatures. An explanation of the correlation of\nsuperconducting transition temperature with experimental inelastic neutron and\nelectron Raman scattering is proposed, based on the energy of the virtual bound\npair. These and other modifications discussed suggest a microscopic explanation\nfor the entire cuprate superconductivity dome shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 14:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-08"}

Our analysis is subdivided into\ninvestigations of early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies. Early-type\ngalaxies reveal a surprisingly tight luminosity-size relation. The dispersion\nin luminosity about the fiducial relation is only ~0.14 dex (0.35 mag), even\nthough the sample contains galaxies which differ by a factor of almost 100 in\nluminosity. The dispersion about the luminosity-size relation is comparable to\nthe dispersion about the fundamental plane, even though the luminosity-size\nrelation is fundamentally simpler and computed using purely photometric\nparameters. The key contributors to the dispersion about the luminosity-size\nrelation are found to be color and central concentration. Expanding our\nanalysis to the full range of morphological types, we show that the slope, zero\npoint, and scatter about the luminosity-size relation is independent of\nenvironmental density. Our study thus indicates that whatever process is\nbuilding galaxies is doing so in a way that preserves fundamental scaling laws\neven as the typical luminosity of galaxies changes with environment.

This variation is in the sense that,\nat a given morphology, larger and more luminous galaxies are rarer in sparser\nenvironments.

For the\nmuch-studied case of Planck-scale effects that intervene in the observation of\ngamma-ray bursts we can estimate the implications of \"quantum spacetime\ncurvature\" within robust simplifying assumptions. For cosmology at the present\nstage of the development of the relevant mathematics one cannot go beyond\nsemiheuristic reasoning, and we here propose a candidate approximate\ndescription of a quantum FRW geometry, obtained by patching together pieces\n(with different spacetime curvature) of our quantum de Sitter.

Secondary production by CRs colliding with gas is included as a\nMonte Carlo process. We find that SNRs produce less antimatter than suggested\npreviously: The positron/electron ratio and the antiproton/proton ratio are a\nfew percent and few $\\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. Both ratios do not rise\nwith energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 15:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 15:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}
