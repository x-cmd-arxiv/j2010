This paper deals mainly with ACA on infinite commutative\ngroups and direct products of them with some non commutative $p$-groups. It\nappears that for all abelian groups, the rules and initial states with finite\nsupports define behaviors which being restricted to some infinite regular\nseries of time moments become significantly simplified. In particular, for free\nabelian groups with $n$ generators states $V^{[t]}$ of ACA with a rule $R$ at\ntime moments $t=p^k,k>k_0,$ can be viewed as $||R||$ copies of initial state\n$V^{[0]}$ moving through an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.

This problem\nis especially acute for integrated groundwater models which are implicitly\ncoupled to another model, such as surface water models, and resolve both\nmultiple scales of flow and temporal interaction terms, giving rise to linear\nsystems with variable scaling.\n  This article uses the theory of 'forward error bound estimation' to show how\nrescaling the linear system affects the correspondence between the residual\nerror in the preconditioned linear system and the solution error. Using\nexamples of linear systems from models developed using the USGS GSFLOW package\nand the California State Department of Water Resources' Integrated Water Flow\nModel (IWFM), we observe that this error bound guides the choice of a practical\nmeasure for controlling the error in rescaled linear systems. It is found that\nforward error can be controlled in preconditioned GMRES by rescaling the linear\nsystem and normalizing the stopping tolerance. We implemented a preconditioned\nGMRES algorithm and benchmarked it against the Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR)\nmethod. Improved error control reduces redundant iterations in the GMRES\nalgorithm and results in overall simulation speedups as large as 7.7x.

A comparison with\nstandard nonlinear mosaicking shows that both processing schemes are not\nmathematically equivalent, though they both recover the sky brightness. In\nparticular, the weighting scheme is very different in both methods. Moreover,\nthe proposed scheme naturally processes the short spacings from both\nsingle-dish antennas and heterogeneous arrays.

These are E1\ntransitions between the F+ and F- hyperfine levels of the Lambda doublet of the\nJ=3/2 state. There are also forbidden M1 transitions between the hyperfine\nlevels within each of the doublet states occuring at frequencies 53.171 MHz and\n55.128 MHz. These are extremely weak and hence difficult to detect. However\nthere is a possibility that the level populations giving rise to these lines\nare inverted under special conditions, in which case it may be possible to\ndetect them through their maser emission. We describe the observational\ndiagnostics for determining when the hyperfine levels are inverted, and\nidentify a region near W44 where these conditions are satisfied. A\nhigh-velocity-resolution search for these hyperfine OH lines using the low\nfrequency feeds on four antennas of the GMRT and the new GMRT Software\nBackend(GSB) was performed on this target near W44. We place a 3-sigma upper\nlimit of ~17.3 Jy (at 1 km/s velocity resolution) for the 55 MHz line from this\nregion.

Strong periodicity was observed among rarely encountering\nmobile nodes while the periodicity was weaker among frequently encountering\nnodes. Further, we present a method to search regularly encountering pairs and\ndiscuss the findings. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the\nperiodicity of encounter pattern with large network traces, which is a critical\nbasis for designing an efficient delivery scheme using mobile nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 08:54:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 22:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The models rely as much as possible on empirical\ningredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric\nlibraries. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of MILES allowed us to\nsafely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old\nage regimes, and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to\n[M/H]=-2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for\nglobular cluster studies. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full\nspectrum fitting or line-strengths. For the latter we propose a new Line Index\nSystem (LIS) to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular\nLick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution.\nApart from constant resolution as function of wavelength the system is also\nbased on flux-calibrated spectra.

The electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks (EMINs) and\nthe Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks (OMINs) have many similarities,\nbut there are some fundamental differences between them such as the\noptical-loss during switching and the crosstalk problem in the optical\nswitches.

These disturbances, interpreted as kink\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are attenuated as they propagate upwards in the\nsolar corona. In this paper we show that resonant absorption provides a simple\nexplanation to the spatial damping of these waves. Kink MHD waves are studied\nusing a cylindrical model of solar magnetic flux tubes which includes a\nnon-uniform layer at the tube boundary. Assuming that the frequency is real and\nthe longitudinal wavenumber complex, the damping length and damping per\nwavelength produced by resonant absorption are analytically calculated. The\ndamping length of propagating kink waves due resonant absorption is a\nmonotonically decreasing function of frequency. For kink waves with low\nfrequencies the damping length is exactly inversely proportional to frequency\nand we denote this as the TGV relation. When moving to high frequencies the TGV\nrelation continues to be an exceptionally good approximation of the actual\ndependency of the damping length on frequency. This dependency means that\nresonant absorption is selective as it favours low frequency waves and can\nefficiently remove high frequency waves from a broad band spectrum of kink\nwaves. It is selective as the damping length is inversely proportional to\nfrequency so that the damping becomes more severe with increasing frequency.\nThis means that radial inhomogeneity can cause solar waveguides to be a natural\nlow-pass filter for broadband disturbances. Hence kink wave trains travelling\nalong, e.g., coronal loops, will have a greater proportion of the high\nfrequency components dissipated lower down in the atmosphere. This could have\nimportant consequences with respect to the spatial distribution of wave heating\nin the solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 10:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It has proven to be an\nefficient probe to study the physical and chemical conditions of these\nenvironments. The study of the deuteration of different molecules helps us to\nunderstand their formation. This is especially interesting for complex\nmolecules such as methanol and bigger molecules for which it may allow to\ndifferentiate between gas-phase and solid-state formation pathways. Methanol\nexhibits a high deuterium fractionation in hot corinos. Since CH3OH is thought\nto be a precursor of methyl formate we expect that deuterated methyl formate is\nproduced in such environments. We have searched for the singly-deuterated\nisotopologue of methyl formate, DCOOCH3, in IRAS 16293-2422, a hot corino\nwell-known for its high degree of methanol deuteration. We have used the\nIRAM/JCMT unbiased spectral survey of IRAS 16293-2422 which allows us to search\nfor the DCOOCH3 rotational transitions within the survey spectral range (80-280\nGHz, 328-366 GHz). The expected emission of deuterated methyl formate is\nmodelled at LTE and compared with the observations.} We have tentatively\ndetected DCOOCH3 in the protostar IRAS 16293-2422. We assign eight lines\ndetected in the IRAM survey to DCOOCH3. Three of these lines are affected by\nblending problems and one line is affected by calibration uncertainties,\nnevertheless the LTE emission model is compatible with the observations. A\nsimple LTE modelling of the two cores in IRAS 16293-2422, based on a previous\ninterferometric study of HCOOCH3, allows us to estimate the amount of DCOOCH3\nin IRAS 16293-2422. Adopting an excitation temperature of 100 K and a source\nsize of 2\\arcsec and 1\\farcs5 for the A and B cores, respectively, we find that\nN(A,DCOOCH3) = N(B,DCOOCH3) ~ 6.10^14 /cm2. The derived deuterium fractionation\nis ~ 15%, consistent with values for other deuterated species in this source\nand much greater than that expected from the deuterium cosmic abundance.\nDCOOCH3, if its tentative detection is confirmed, should now be considered in\ntheoretical models that study complex molecule formation and their deuteration\nmechanisms. Experimental work is also needed to investigate the different\nchemical routes leading to the formation of deuterated methyl formate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 11:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Here\nwe demonstrate experimentally a new compact X-ray source involving high-order\nharmonics produced by a relativistic-irradiance femtosecond laser in a gas\ntarget. In our first implementation using a 9 Terawatt laser, coherent soft\nX-rays are emitted with a comb-like spectrum reaching the 'water window' range.\nThe generation mechanism is robust being based on phenomena inherent in\nrelativistic laser plasmas: self-focusing, nonlinear wave generation\naccompanied by electron density singularities, and collective radiation by a\ncompact electric charge. The formation of singularities (electron density\nspikes) is described by the elegant mathematical catastrophe theory, which\nexplains sudden changes in various complex systems, from physics to social\nsciences. The new X-ray source has advantageous scalings, as the maximum\nharmonic order is proportional to the cube of the laser amplitude enhanced by\nrelativistic self-focusing in plasma. This allows straightforward extension of\nthe coherent X-ray generation to the keV and tens of keV spectral regions.

This problem has received increasing interest as an\nextension of the single channel sparse recovery problem which lies at the heart\nof the emerging field of compressed sensing. However the sparse approximation\nproblem has origins which include links to the field of array signal processing\nwhere we find the inspiration for a new family of MMV algorithms based on the\nMUSIC algorithm. We highlight the role of the rank of the coefficient matrix X\nin determining the difficulty of the recovery problem. We derive the necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the sparse MMV solution, which\nindicates that the larger the rank of X the less sparse X needs to be to ensure\nuniqueness. We also show that the larger the rank of X the less the\ncomputational effort required to solve the MMV problem through a combinatorial\nsearch. In the second part of the paper we consider practical suboptimal\nalgorithms for solving the sparse MMV problem. We examine the rank awareness of\npopular algorithms such as SOMP and mixed norm minimization techniques and show\nthem to be rank blind in terms of worst case analysis.

The simplest such algorithm is\na discrete version of MUSIC and is guaranteed to recover the sparse vectors in\nthe full rank MMV case under mild conditions. We extend this idea to develop a\nrank aware pursuit algorithm that naturally reduces to Order Recursive Matching\nPursuit (ORMP) in the single measurement case and also provides guaranteed\nrecovery in the full rank multi-measurement case.

The time evolution\nof the cluster fractal dimension is linked to the dynamics of two populations,\nsmall ($k \\le 15$) and large ($k>15$) clusters.

The standard view which treats the solar cycle as a manifestation of the\ninteraction between convection and magnetic fields is shown to be misplaced.\nThe main ingredient of the solar cycle, apart from differential rotation, is\ninstead buoyant instability of the magnetic field itself. This view of the\nphysics of the solar cycle was already established in the 1950s, but has been\neclipsed mathematically by mean field turbulence formalisms which make poor\ncontact with observations and have serious theoretical problems. The history of\nthis development in the literature is discussed critically. The source of the\nmagnetic field of the solar cycle is currently assumed to be located in the\n`tachocline': the shear zone at the base of the convection zone. While the\nazimuthal field of the cycle is indeed most likely located at the base of the\nconvection zone, it cannot be powered by the radial shear of the tachocline as\nassumed in these models, since the radiative interior does not support\nsignificant shear stresses.

A widely adopted parameterization of the SFH, the\nso-called tau-models where SFR goes as e^{-t/tau) is shown to lead to\nunrealistically low ages when applied to star forming galaxies at z ~ 2, a\nproblem shared by other SFHs when the age is left as a free parameter in the\nfitting. This happens because the SED of such galaxies, at all wavelengths, is\ndominated by their youngest stellar populations, which outshine the older ones.\nThus, the SED of such galaxies conveys little information on the beginning of\nstar formation. To cope with this problem, we explore a variety of SFHs, such\nas constant SFR and inverted-tau models - with SFR as e^{+t/tau) - along with\nvarious priors on age, including assuming that star formation started at high\nredshift in all the galaxies. We find that inverted-tau models with such latter\nassumption give SFRs and extinctions in excellent agreement with the values\nderived using only the UV part of the SED. These models are also shown to\naccurately recover the SFRs and masses of mock galaxies at z ~ 2 constructed\nfrom semi-analytic models. All other explored SFH templates do not fulfil these\ntwo test. In particular, direct-tau models with unconstrained age in the\nfitting procedure overstimate SFRs and underestimate stellar mass, and would\nexacerbate an apparent mismatch between the cosmic evolution of the volume\ndensities of SFR and stellar mass. We conclude that for high-redshift star\nforming galaxies an exponentially increasing SFR with a high formation redshift\nis preferable to other forms of the SFH so far adopted in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 14:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

From the photometry and the properties of the planet\nsignal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit we\ndirectly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of its\norbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of the\nstar. This kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planets\naround a whole new class of young, early-type stars, hence under different\nphysical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than in\nsharp-lined late-type stars. The reflex orbital motion of the star caused by\nthe transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 Jupiter\nmasses on the planet. We also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar mass\nin the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. In\nHD 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radial\npulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. This raises the\nintriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite or\namplify the pulsations in such stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 15:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

These stars have rotation\nperiods between 0.1 and 15 days. Intermediate resolution spectra were obtained\nusing the Giraffe spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Membership was\nconfirmed on the basis of RVs for 210 targets. We see a marked increase in the\nfraction of rapidly rotators as we move to cooler spectral types. About 20 per\ncent of M0-M1 stars have v sin i >15km/s, increasing to 90 per cent of M4\nstars. Activity indices derived from the first two lines of the CaT (8498A and\n8542A) show differing dependencies on rotation period and mass for stars lying\nabove and below the fully convective boundary. Higher mass stars, of spectral\ntype K3-M2.5, show chromospheric activity which increases with decreasing\nRossby number (the ratio of period to convective turnover time), saturating for\nRossby numbers <0.1. For cooler stars, which are probably fully convective and\nalmost all of which have Rossby numbers <0.1, there is a clear decrease in\nchromospheric activity as (V-I)_0 increases, amounting to a fall of about a\nfactor of 2-3 between spectral types M2.5 and M4. This decrease in activity\nlevels at low Rossby numbers is not seen in X-ray observations of the coronae\nof cluster M-dwarfs or of active field M-dwarfs. There is no evidence for\nsupersaturation of chromospheric activity for stars of any spectral type at\nRossby numbers <0.01. We suggest that the fall in the limiting level of\nchromospheric emission beyond spectral type M3 in NGC~2516 is, like the\nsimultaneous increase in rotation rates in field stars, associated with a\nchange in the global magnetic topology as stars approach the fully convective\nboundary and not due to any decrease in dynamo-generated magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 15:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This problem is the most natural\noptimization version of the well known and well studied Hamiltonian path\nproblem, and thus it is NP-hard on general graphs. However, in contrast to the\nHamiltonian path problem, there are only few restricted graph families such as\ntrees and some small graph classes where polynomial algorithms for the longest\npath problem have been found. Recently it has been shown that this problem can\nbe solved in polynomial time on interval graphs by applying dynamic programming\nto a characterizing ordering of the vertices of the given graph\n\\cite{longest-int-algo}, thus answering an open question. In the present paper,\nwe provide the first polynomial algorithm for the longest path problem on a\nmuch greater class, namely on cocomparability graphs. Our algorithm uses a\nsimilar - but essentially simpler - dynamic programming approach, which is\napplied to a Lexicographic Depth First Search (LDFS) characterizing ordering of\nthe vertices of a cocomparability graph. Therefore, our results provide\nevidence that this general dynamic programming approach can be used in a more\ngeneral setting, leading to efficient algorithms for the longest path problem\non greater classes of graphs. LDFS has recently been introduced in\n\\cite{Corneil-LDFS08}. Since then, a similar phenomenon of extending an\nexisting interval graph algorithm to cocomparability graphs by using an LDFS\npreprocessing step has also been observed for the minimum path cover problem\n\\cite{Corneil-MPC}. Therefore, more interestingly, our results also provide\nevidence that cocomparability graphs present an interval graph structure when\nthey are considered using an LDFS ordering of their vertices, which may lead to\nother new and more efficient combinatorial algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}
