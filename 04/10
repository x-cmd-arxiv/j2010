An excessive amount of water\nmolecules in all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations often negatively\nimpacts the sampling efficiency of some advanced sampling techniques such as\nthe replica exchange method and it makes the investigation of chemical\ninterferences on protein dynamics difficult. Thus, there is a need to develop\nan effective strategy that focuses on sampling structural changes in protein\nconformations rather than solvent molecule fluctuations. In this work, we\naddress this issue by devising a multiscale simulation scheme (MultiSCAAL) that\nbridges the gap between all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and\ncoarse-grained molecular simulation. The two key features of this scheme are\nthe Boltzmann inversion and a protein atomistic reconstruction method we\npreviously developed (SCAAL). Using MultiSCAAL, we were able to enhance the\nsampling efficiency of proteins solvated by explicit water molecules. Our\nmethod has been tested on the folding energy landscape of a small protein\nTrp-cage with explicit solvent under 8M urea using both the all-atomistic\nreplica exchange molecular dynamics (AA-REMD) and MultiSCAAL. We compared\ncomputational analyses on ensemble conformations of Trp-cage with its available\nexperimental NOE distances. The analysis demonstrated that conformations\nexplored by MultiSCAAL better agree with the ones probed in the experiments\nbecause it can effectively capture the changes in side chain orientations that\ncan flip out of the hydrophobic pocket in the presence of urea and water\nmolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 16:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-10"}

The dependences of the photon rates on the jet\nkinematic characteristics (momentum, mass, etc.) and on the jet charged,\nneutral and total hadron multiplicities are reported. Up to a scale factor of\nabout four, which characterizes the overall value of the soft photon excess, a\nsimilarity of the observed soft photon behaviour to that of the inner hadronic\nbremsstrahlung predictions is found for the momentum, mass, and jet charged\nmultiplicity dependences.

The observed linear increase of the soft photon\nproduction rate with the jet total hadron multiplicity and its strong\ndependence on the jet neutral multiplicity suggest that the rate is\nproportional to the number of quark pairs produced in the fragmentation\nprocess, with the neutral pairs being more effectively radiating than the\ncharged ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 16:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Arp's loop is commonly interpreted as a\ntail resulting from the tidal interaction between M81 and M82. However, since\nits discovery the nature of this feature has remained controversial. Aims: Our\nprimary purpose was to identify the sources of optical and infrared emission\nobserved in Arp's loop. Methods: The morphology of the Arp's loop has been\ninvestigated with deep wide-field optical images. We also measured its colors\nusing IRAS and Spitzer-MIPS infrared images and compared them with those of the\ndisk of M81 and Galactic dust cirrus that fills the area where M81 is located.\nResults: Optical images reveal that this peculiar object has a filamentary\nstructure characterized by many dust features overlapping M81's field. The\nratios of far-infrared fluxes and the estimated dust-to-gas ratios indicate the\ninfrared emission of Arp's loop is dominated by the contribution of cold dust\nthat is most likely from Galactic cirrus. Conclusions: The above results\nsuggest that the light observed at optical wavelengths is a combination of\nemission from i) a few recent star forming regions located close to M81, where\nboth bright UV complexes and peaks in the HI distribution are found, ii) the\nextended disk of M81 and iii) scattered light from the same Galactic cirrus\nthat is responsible for the bulk of the far infrared emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 17:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 17:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Hyperfine structure is\nseen in the rotational spectra of many commonly observed molecules such as HCN,\nHNC, NH3, N2H+, and C17O. The intensities of these spectral lines can be\nmodeled by numerical techniques such as Lambda-iteration that alternately solve\nthe equations of statistical equilibrium and the equation of radiative\ntransfer. However, these calculations require knowledge of both the radiative\nand collisional rates for all transitions. For most commonly observed radio\nfrequency spectral lines, only the net collisional rates between rotational\nlevels are known. For such cases, two approximate methods have been suggested.\nThe first method, hyperfine statistical equilibrium (HSE), distributes the\nhyperfine level populations according to their statistical weight, but allows\nthe population of the rotational states to depart from local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE). The second method, the proportional method approximates the\ncollision rates between the hyperfine levels as fractions of the net rotational\nrate apportioned according to the statistical degeneracy of the final hyperfine\nlevels. The second method is able to model non-LTE hyperfine emission. We\ncompare simulations of N2H+ hyperfine lines made with approximate and more\nexact rates and find that satisfactory results are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 17:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It allows to detect weak sources by using quasi-simultaneous\nobservations of closeby sources acting as calibrators. Therefore, it is assumed\nthat, for each antenna, the optical paths of the signals from both sources are\nsimilar. However, atmospheric turbulence may introduce strong differences in\nthe optical paths of the signals and affect, or even waste, phase referencing\nfor cases of relatively large calibrator-to-target separations and/or bad\nweather. The situation is similar in wide-field observations, since the random\ndeformations of the images, mostly caused by atmospheric turbulence, have\nessentially the same origin as the random astrometric variations of\nphase-referenced sources with respect to the phase center of their calibrators.\nIn this paper, we present the results of a Monte Carlo study of the astrometric\nprecision and sensitivity of an interferometric array (a realization of the\nSquare Kilometre Array, SKA) in phase-referenced and wide-field observations.\nThese simulations can be extrapolated to other arrays by applying the\ncorresponding corrections. We consider several effects from the turbulent\natmosphere (i.e., ionosphere and wet component of the troposphere) and also\nfrom the antenna receivers. We study the changes in dynamic range and\nastrometric precision as a function of observing frequency, source separation,\nand strength of the turbulence. We find that, for frequencies between 1 and 10\nGHz, it is possible to obtain images with high fidelity, although the\natmosphere strongly limits the sensitivity of the instrument compared to the\ncase with no atmosphere. Outside this frequency window, the dynamic range of\nthe images and the accuracy of the source positions decrease. [...] (Incomplete\nabstract.

The energy balance of cataclysmic variables with strong magnetic\nfields is a central subject in understanding accretion processes on magnetic\nwhite dwarfs. With XMM-Newton, we perform a spectroscopic and photometric study\nof soft X-ray selected polars during their high states of accretion. Aims. On\nthe basis of X-ray and optical observations of the magnetic cataclysmic\nvariable AI Tri, we derive the properties of the spectral components, their\nflux contributions, and the physical structure of the accretion region in soft\npolars. Methods. We use multi-temperature approaches in our xspec modeling of\nthe spectra to describe the physical conditions and the structures of the\npost-shock accretion flow and the accretion spot on the white-dwarf surface. In\naddition, we investigate the accretion geometry of the system by a timing\nanalysis of the photometric data. Results. Flaring soft X-ray emission from the\nheated surface of the white dwarf dominates the X-ray flux during roughly 70%\nof the binary cycle. This component deviates from a single black body and can\nbe described by a superimposition of mildly absorbed black bodies with a\nGaussian temperature distribution. In addition, weaker hard X-ray emission is\nvisible nearly all the time. The spectrum from the cooling post-shock accretion\nflow is most closely fitted by a combination of thermal plasma mekal models\nwith temperature profiles adapted from prior stationary two-fluid hydrodynamic\ncalculations. The soft X-ray light curves show a dip during the bright phase,\nwhich can be interpreted as self-absorption in the accretion stream.\nPhase-resolved spectral modeling supports the picture of one-pole accretion and\nself-eclipse. One of the optical light curves corresponds to an irregular mode\nof accretion. During a short XMM-Newton observation at the same epoch, the\nX-ray emission of the system is clearly dominated by the soft component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 19:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The central theorem of this thesis proves the existence of a\nprotocol that transmits quantum data that is partially known to the receiver\nthrough a single use of an arbitrary noisy quantum channel. In addition to the\nintrinsic interest of this problem, this theorem has as immediate corollaries\nseveral central theorems of quantum information theory. The following chapters\nuse this theorem to prove the existence of new protocols for two other types of\nquantum channels, namely quantum broadcast channels and quantum channels with\nside information at the transmitter. These protocols also involve sending\nquantum information partially known by the receiver with a single use of the\nchannel, and have as corollaries entanglement-assisted and unassisted\nasymptotic coding theorems. The entanglement-assisted asymptotic versions can,\nin both cases, be considered as quantum versions of the best coding theorems\nknown for the classical versions of these problems. The last chapter deals with\na purely quantum phenomenon called locking. We demonstrate that it is possible\nto encode a classical message into a quantum state such that, by removing a\nsubsystem of logarithmic size with respect to its total size, no measurement\ncan have significant correlations with the message. The message is therefore\n\"locked\" by a logarithmic-size key. This thesis presents the first locking\nprotocol for which the success criterion is that the trace distance between the\njoint distribution of the message and the measurement result and the product of\ntheir marginals be sufficiently small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 20:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

The incidence and\nstrength of emission do not correlate either with the E/S0 classification, or\nwith the fast/slow rotator classification. Comparing the nuclear r<r_e/16 line\nemission with the classical [OIII]/Hb vs [NII]/Ha diagnostic diagram, the\ngalaxy activity is so classified: 72% are LINERs, 9% are Seyferts, 12% are\nComposite/Transition objects, and 7% are non-classified. Seyferts have young\nluminosity-weighted ages (<5 Gyr), and are significantly younger than LINERs\nand Composites. Seyferts excluded, the spread in the ([OIII], Ha or [NII])\nemission strength increases with the galaxy central velocity dispersion. The\n[NII]/Ha ratio decreases with increasing galacto-centric distance, indicating\neither a decrease of the nebular metallicity, or a progressive \"softening\" of\nthe ionizing spectrum. The average oxygen abundance of the ionized gas is\nslightly less than solar, and a comparison with the results obtained in Paper\nIII from Lick indices reveals that it is ~0.2 dex lower than that of stars.\nConclusions: the nuclear emission can be explained with photoionization by PAGB\nstars alone only in ~22% of the LINERs/Composite sample. On the other hand, we\ncan not exclude an important role of PAGB star photoionization at larger radii.\nFor the major fraction of the sample, the nuclear emission is consistent with\nexcitation from a low-accretion rate AGN, fast shocks (200 -500 km/s) in a\nrelatively gas-poor environment (n< 100 cm^-3), or coexistence of the two. The\nderived nebular metallicities suggest either an external origin of the gas, or\nan overestimate of the oxygen yields by SN models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 20:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We study specific dynamics for subadiabatic, adiabatic and\nsuperadiabatic vertical stratifications. In the absence of self-gravity, four\nwell-known principal modes can be identified in a stratified disc: acoustic p-,\nsurface gravity f-, buoyancy g- and inertial r-modes. After characterizing\nmodes in the non-self-gravitating case, we include self-gravity and investigate\nhow it modifies the properties of these modes. We find that self-gravity, to a\ncertain degree, reduces their frequencies and changes the structure of the\ndispersion curves and eigenfunctions at radial wavelengths comparable to the\ndisc height. Its influence on the basic branch of the r-mode, in the case of\nsubadiabatic and adiabatic stratifications, and on the basic branch of the\ng-mode, in the case of superadiabatic stratification (which in addition\nexhibits convective instability), does appear to be strongest. Reducing the\nthree-dimensional Toomre's parameter Q_{3D} results in the latter modes\nbecoming unstable due to self-gravity, so that they determine the onset\ncriterion and nature of gravitational instability of a stratified disc. By\ncontrast, the p-, f- and convectively stable g-modes, although their\ncorresponding \\omega^2 are reduced by self-gravity, never become unstable\nhowever small the value of Q_{3D}. This is a consequence of the\nthree-dimensionality of the disc. The eigenfunctions corresponding to the\ngravitationally unstable modes are intrinsically 3D. We also contrast the more\nexact instability criterion based on our 3D model with that of density waves in\n2D (razor-thin) discs. Based on these findings, we comment on the origin of\nsurface distortions seen in numerical simulations of self-gravitating discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 23:38:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 22:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For instance, the structure of the network plays an important\nrole in spreading of epidemics. Additionally, properties of previous epidemic\nmodels require prior knowledge of the complex network structure, which means\nthe models are limited to only well-known network structures. In this paper, we\npropose a new epidemiological SIR model based on the continuous time Markov\nchain, which is generalized to any type of network. The new model is capable of\nevaluating the states of every individual in the network. Through mathematical\nanalysis, we prove an epidemic threshold exists below which an epidemic does\nnot propagate in the network. We also show that the new epidemic threshold is\ninversely proportional to the spectral radius of the network. In particular, we\nemploy the new epidemic model as a novel measure to assess the vulnerability of\nnetworks to the spread of epidemics. The new measure considers all possible\neffective infection rates that an epidemic might possess. Next, we apply the\nmeasure to correlated networks to evaluate the vulnerability of disassortative\nand assortative scalefree networks. Ultimately, we verify the accuracy of the\ntheoretical epidemic threshold through extensive numerical simulations. Within\nthe set of tested networks, the numerical results show that disassortative\nscale-free networks are more vulnerable to spreading of epidemics than\nassortative scale-free networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 00:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of\nnodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly\nconnected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications.\nRouting protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in\nthe network. However, the correctness of a particular routing protocol mainly\ndepends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements.\nThis paper presents a dynamic discover routing method for communication between\nsensor nodes and a base station in WSN. This method tolerates failures of\narbitrary individual nodes in the network (node failure) or a small part of the\nnetwork (area failure). Each node in the network does only local routing\npreservation, needs to record only its neighbor nodes' information, and incurs\nno extra routing overhead during failure free periods. It dynamically discovers\nnew routes when an intermediate node or a small part of the network in the path\nfrom a sensor node to a base station fails. In our planned method, every node\ndecides its path based only on local information, such as its parent node and\nneighbor nodes' routing information. So, it is possible to form a loop in the\nrouting path. We believe that the loop problem in sensor network routing is not\nas serious as that in the Internet routing or traditional mobile ad-hoc\nrouting. We are trying to find all possible loops and eliminate the loops as\nfar as possible in WSN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 03:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

To this end, a pre-synthesis optimization step is\nintroduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible\nfunction. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be\nused as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The\nselected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential\nrepresentation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library\ncontaining seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle\nof length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a\ndecomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent\nfactorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions\ncontain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are\nused in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed\nbased on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.\nThen, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the\nlibrary. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method\nare considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the\nlibrary for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is\nintroduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 08:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

Space-time codes\nmake use of advantage of both the spatial diversity provided by multiple\nantennas and the temporal diversity available with time-varying fading.\nSpace-time codes can be divided into block codes and trellis codes.

To extend the\nsolutions globally we build on an idea due to Colliander, Holmer and Tzirakis.\nFor this we rely on the fact that MD is charge subcritical in two space\ndimensions, and make use of the null structure of the Maxwell part.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 14:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 15:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 13:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-10"}

Let $K_p$ be the completion of $K$ at $p$. In a previous paper,\nwe constructed a $p$-adic invariant $u_C\\in K_p$, and we proved a $p$-adic\nKronecker limit formula relating $u_C$ to the first derivative at $s=0$ of a\ncertain $p$-adic zeta function. By analogy with the $p$- adic Gross-Stark\nconjectures, we conjectured that $u_C$ is a $p$-unit in a suitable narrow ray\nclass field of $K$. Recently, Dasgupta has proposed an exact $p$-adic formula\nfor the Gross-Stark units of an arbitrary totally real number field. In our\nspecial setting, i.e., where one deals with a real quadratic number field, his\nconstruction produces a $p$-adic invariant $u_D\\in K_p$ . In this paper we show\nprecise relationships between the $p$-adic invariants $u_C$ and $u_D$. In order\nto do so, we extend Dasgupta's construction of $u_D$ to a broader setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 14:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

Our results also cover the case of \"slightly unbounded\"\nvorticities for which Yudovich extended his analysis in 1995. Moreover if in\naddition the initial vorticity is Holder continuous on a part of the domain\nthen this Holder regularity propagates smoothly along the flow lines. Finally\nwe observe that if the vorticity is constant in a neighborhood of the boundary,\nthe smoothness of the boundary is not necessary for these results to hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 15:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}
