Interpreting the bistable mode as a reaction (isomerization) coordinate,\nwe establish connections with the theory of unimolecular reaction rates, in\nparticular the formulation of isomerization rates in terms of gap times. The\ndistribution of gap times (or associated lifetimes) for a microcanonical\nensemble initiated on the dividing surface is of great dynamical significance;\nan exponential lifetime distribution is usually taken to be an indicator of\n`statistical' behavior. Moreover, comparison of the magnitude of the phase\nspace volume swept out by reactive trajectories as they pass through the\nreactant region with the total phase space volume (classical density of states)\nfor the reactant region provides a necessary condition for ergodic dynamics.

The problem of interest in this paper is to minimize the\nrepair bandwidth B for exact regeneration of a single failed node, i.e., the\nminimum data to be downloaded by a new node to replace the failed node by its\nexact replica. Previous work has shown that a bandwidth of B=[M(n-1)]/[k(n-k)]\nis necessary and sufficient for functional (not exact) regeneration.

This approach models a bulk system by a single macroion,\ntogether with counterions and salt ions, confined to a symmetrically shaped,\nelectroneutral cell. While easing solution of the nonlinear PB equation, the\ncell model neglects microion-induced correlations between macroions, precluding\nmodeling of macroion ordering phenomena. An alternative approach, avoiding\nartificial constraints of cell geometry, maps a macroion-microion mixture onto\na one-component model of pseudo-macroions governed by effective interactions.\nIn practice, effective-interaction models are usually based on linear screening\napproximations, which can accurately describe nonlinear screening only by\nincorporating an effective (renormalized) macroion charge. Combining charge\nrenormalization and linearized PB theories, in both the cell model and an\neffective-interaction (cell-free) model, we compute osmotic pressures of highly\ncharged colloids and monovalent microions over a range of concentrations. By\ncomparing predictions with primitive model simulation data for salt-free\nsuspensions, and with predictions of nonlinear PB theory for salty suspensions,\nwe chart the limits of both the cell model and linear-screening approximations\nin modeling bulk thermodynamic properties. Up to moderately strong\nelectrostatic couplings, the cell model proves accurate in predicting osmotic\npressures of deionized suspensions. With increasing salt concentration,\nhowever, the relative contribution of macroion interactions grows, leading\npredictions of the cell and effective-interaction models to deviate. No\nevidence is found for a liquid-vapour phase instability driven by monovalent\nmicroions. These results may guide applications of PB theory to soft materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2010 22:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Each agent\nin the market is additionally limited by a capacity representing the number of\ncontracts which he or she may undertake. When all agents are limited to just\none contract each, prior research applied natural generalizations of the Nash\nbargaining solution to the networked setting, defined the new solution concepts\nof stable and balanced, and characterized the resulting bargaining outcomes. We\nsimplify and generalize these results to a setting in which participants in\nonly one side of the market are limited to one contract each.

These\nproblems are further exacerbated by the dynamics in wireless mobile networks.\nIn this paper we address the issue of trust advisory and establishment in\nmobile networks, with application to ad hoc networks, including DTNs. We\nutilize encounters in mobile societies in novel ways, noticing that mobility\nprovides opportunities to build proximity, location and similarity based trust.\nFour new trust advisor filters are introduced - including encounter frequency,\nduration, behavior vectors and behavior matrices - and evaluated over an\nextensive set of real-world traces collected from a major university. Two sets\nof statistical analyses are performed; the first examines the underlying\nencounter relationships in mobile societies, and the second evaluates DTN\nrouting in mobile peer-to-peer networks using trust and selfishness models. We\nfind that for the analyzed trace, trust filters are stable in terms of growth\nwith time (3 filters have close to 90% overlap of users over a period of 9\nweeks) and the results produced by different filters are noticeably different.\nIn our analysis for trust and selfishness model, our trust filters largely undo\nthe effect of selfishness on the unreachability in a network. Thus improving\nthe connectivity in a network with selfish nodes.\n  We hope that our initial promising results open the door for further research\non proximity-based trust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2010 05:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}
