A genotype is viable in a given\nenvironment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism\nneeds to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of\nindividual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic\nnetworks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We\nhere characterize spaces of such genotypes.

The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to\nrandom reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high\nmean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in\ntheir genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be\nviable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic\nreactions were used independently across different chemical environments.\nConclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have\ngeneric organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to\nthe number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 16:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-16"}

In contrast to more studied sampling techniques, such as random walks,\nthe precise bias of BFS has not been characterized to date. In this paper, we\nquantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we calculate the node\ndegree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the\nfraction of covered nodes, in a random graph $RG(p_k)$ with a given degree\ndistribution $p_k$. Furthermore, we also show that, for $RG(p_k)$, all commonly\nused graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, and Snowball Sampling)\nlead to the same bias, and we show how to correct for this bias. To give a\nbroader perspective, we compare this class of exploration techniques to random\nwalks that are well-studied and easier to analyze. Next, we study by simulation\nthe effect of graph properties not captured directly by our model. We find that\nthe bias gets amplified in graphs with strong positive assortativity.

The rovibrational states are thus pushed downward in such a field. A\nnonresonant pulsed laser field that interacts nonadiabatically with the\nmolecule is found to impart rotational and vibrational shifts of the same order\nof magnitude. The nonadiabatic energy transfer occurs most readily at a pulse\nduration which amounts to about a tenth of the molecule's rotational period,\nand vanishes when the sudden regime is attained for shorter pulses. We applied\nour treatment to the much studied 87Rb_2 molecule in the last bound vibrational\nlevels of its lowest singlet and triplet electronic states. Our calculations\nindicate that 15 ns and 1.5 ns laser pulses of an intensity in excess of 5x10^9\nW/cm^2 are capable of dissociating the molecule due to the vibrational shift.\nLesser shifts can be used to fine tune the rovibrational levels and thereby to\naffect collisional resonances by the nonresonant light. The energy shifts may\nbe discernible spectroscopically, at a 10 MHz resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 21:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 10:03:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 08:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

In the field of medical diagnosis an\nextensive diversity of imaging techniques is presently available, such as\nradiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nMedical image segmentation is an essential step for most consequent image\nanalysis tasks. Although the original FCM algorithm yields good results for\nsegmenting noise free images, it fails to segment images corrupted by noise,\noutliers and other imaging artifact.

Contrary to the conventional notion, we\nsuggest that close packing form the underlying principle behind the structure\nof collagen, and the implications of this suggestion are considered. Further,\nit is shown that the unique zero-twist structure with no strain-twist coupling\nis practically identical to the close-packed triple helix. Some of the\ndifficulties for the current understanding of the structure of collagen are\nreviewed: The ambiguity in assigning crystal structures for collagen-like\npeptides, and the failure to satisfactorily calculate circular dichroism\nspectra. Further, the proposed new geometrical structure for collagen is better\npacked than both the 10/3 and the 7/2 structure. A feature of the suggested\ncollagen structure is the existence of a central channel with negatively\ncharged walls. We find support for this structural feature in some of the early\nx-ray diffraction data of collagen. The central channel of the structure\nsuggests the possibility of a one-dimensional proton lattice. This geometry can\nexplain the observed magic angle effect seen in NMR studies of collagen. The\ncentral channel also offers the possibility of ion transport and may cast new\nlight on various biological and physical phenomena, including\nbiomineralization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 10:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

The PDDP algorithm\nrecursively splits the data samples into two sub clusters using the hyper plane\nnormal to the principal direction derived from the covariance matrix, which is\nthe central logic of the algorithm. However, the PDDP algorithm can yield poor\nresults, especially when clusters are not well separated from one another. To\nimprove the quality of the clustering results problem, it is resolved by\nreallocating new cluster membership using the IB algorithm with different\nsettings. IB Method gives accuracy but time consumption is more. Furthermore,\nbased on the theoretical background of the sGEM algorithm and sequential\nInformation Bottleneck method(sIB), it can be obvious to extend the framework\nto cover the problem of estimating the number of clusters using the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithm with comparison to the existing algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 11:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

Without ordering, the first\norder part is $\\Pi_2$ Horn; if ordering is used, then it is universal Horn (in\nwhich case, the second order variables can be determined in polynomial time).\nUPDATE: Manuscript withdrawn, because results are incorrect. If phi = phi_1 AND\nphi_2, and phi is a Horn formula, it does NOT mean that both phi_1 and phi_2\nare Horn formulae. Furthermore, the cardinality constraint CANNOT be expressed\nas a universal Horn sentence in ESO (NOT even when the structure is ordered).\nGraedel's theorem is valid at a lower (machine) level, but probably NOT at a\nhigher level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 14:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 12:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 13:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 08:35:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 22:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}
