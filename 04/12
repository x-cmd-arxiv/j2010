These results generally make heavy use of the generative\nmodel and particular properties of the distributions. In this paper, we show\nthat a simple clustering algorithm works without assuming any generative\n(probabilistic) model. Our only assumption is what we call a \"proximity\ncondition\": the projection of any data point onto the line joining its cluster\ncenter to any other cluster center is $\\Omega(k)$ standard deviations closer to\nits own center than the other center. Here the notion of standard deviations is\nbased on the spectral norm of the matrix whose rows represent the difference\nbetween a point and the mean of the cluster to which it belongs. We show that\nin the generative models studied, our proximity condition is satisfied and so\nwe are able to derive most known results for generative models as corollaries\nof our main result.

We consider\nthe benchmark problem for the following families of states: (i) displaced\nthermal equilibrium states of given temperature; (ii) independent identically\nprepared qubits with completely unknown state. For the first family we show\nthat the optimal procedure is heterodyne measurement followed by the\npreparation of a coherent state. This procedure was known to be optimal for\ncoherent states and for squeezed states with the `overlap fidelity' as figure\nof merit. Here we prove its optimality with respect to the trace norm distance\nand supremum risk. For the second problem we consider n i.i.d. spin-1/2 systems\nin an arbitrary unknown state $\\rho$ and look for the measurement-preparation\npair $(M_{n},P_{n})$ for which the reconstructed state $\\omega_{n}:=P_{n}\\circ\nM_{n} (\\rho^{\\otimes n})$ is as close as possible to the input state, i.e.\n$\\|\\omega_{n}- \\rho^{\\otimes n}\\|_{1}$ is small. The figure of merit is based\non the trace norm distance between input and output states. We show that\nasymptotically with $n$ the this problem is equivalent to the first one. The\nproof and construction of $(M_{n},P_{n})$ uses the theory of local asymptotic\nnormality developed for state estimation which shows that i.i.d. quantum models\ncan be approximated in a strong sense by quantum Gaussian models.

The jets are powered by gas\naccretion onto Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) which also grow by mergers.\nThroughout its formation, the cluster experiences different dynamical states:\nboth a morphologically perturbed epoch at early times and a relaxed state at\nlate times allowing us to study the different modes of BH growth and associated\nAGN jet feedback. BHs accrete gas efficiently at high redshift (z>2),\nsignificantly pre-heating proto-cluster halos. Gas-rich mergers at high\nredshift also fuel strong, episodic jet activity, which transports gas from the\nproto-cluster core to its outer regions. At later times, while the cluster\nrelaxes, the supply of cold gas onto the BHs is reduced leading to lower jet\nactivity. Although the cluster is still heated by this activity as sound waves\npropagate from the core to the virial radius, the jets inefficiently\nredistribute gas outwards and a small cooling flow develops, along with\nlow-pressure cavities similar to those detected in X-ray observations. Overall,\nour jet implementation of AGN feedback quenches star formation quite\nefficiently, reducing the stellar content of the central cluster galaxy by a\nfactor 3 compared to the no AGN case.

To make these models more\nrobust, it is important to understand their sensitivity to a variety of\nparameters. In this article, we report a study of the sensitivity of a chemical\nmodel of a cold dense core, with homogeneous and time-independent physical\nconditions, to variations in the following parameters: initial chemical\ninventory, gas temperature and density, cosmic-ray ionization rate, chemical\nreaction rate coefficients, and elemental abundances. From the results of the\nparameter variations, we can quantify the sensitivity of the model to each\nparameter as a function of time. Our results can be used in principle with\nobservations to constrain some parameters for different cold clouds. We also\nattempted to use the Monte Carlo approach with all parameters varied\ncollectively. Within the parameter ranges studied, the most critical parameters\nturn out to be the reaction rate coefficients at times up to 4e5 yr and\nelemental abundances at later times. At typical times of best agreement with\nobservation, models are sensitive to both of these parameters. The models are\nless sensitive to other parameters such as the gas density and temperature. The\nimprovement of models will require that the uncertainties in rate coefficients\nof important reactions be reduced. As the chemistry becomes better understood\nand more robust, it should be possible to use model sensitivities concerning\nother parameters, such as the elemental abundances and the cosmic ray\nionization rate, to yield detailed information on cloud properties and history.\nNevertheless, at the current stage, we cannot determine the best values of all\nthe parameters simultaneously based on purely observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2010 09:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-16"}

Methods: We have performed an in-depth\nanalysis of a large number of molecular emission lines excited in the\ncircumstellar envelope around IK~Tau. The analysis is done based on a non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer analysis, which\ncalculates the temperature and velocity structure in a self-consistent way. The\nchemical abundance pattern is coupled to theoretical outer wind model\npredictions including photodestruction and cosmic ray ionization. Not only the\nintegrated line intensities, but also the line shapes, are used as diagnostic\ntool to study the envelope structure. Results: The deduced wind acceleration is\nmuch slower than predicted from classical theories. SiO and SiS are depleted in\nthe envelope, possibly due to the adsorption onto dust grains. For HCN and CS a\nclear difference with respect to inner wind non-equilibrium predictions is\nfound, either indicating uncertainties in the inner wind theoretical modeling\nor the possibility that HCN and CS (or the radical CN) participate in the dust\nformation. The low signal-to-noise profiles of SO and CN prohibit an accurate\nabundance determination; the modeling of high-excitation SO$_2$ lines is\ncumbersome, possibly related to line misidentifications or problems with the\ncollisional rates.

Using LISA observations, we\nwill be able to measure the parameters of each EMRI system detected to very\nhigh precision. However, the statistics of the set of EMRI events observed by\nLISA will be more important in constraining astrophysical models than extremely\nprecise measurements for individual systems. The black holes to which LISA is\nmost sensitive are in a mass range that is difficult to probe using other\ntechniques, so LISA provides an almost unique window onto these objects. In\nthis paper we explore, using Bayesian techniques, the constraints that LISA\nEMRI observations can place on the mass function of black holes at low\nredshift. We describe a general framework for approaching inference of this\ntype --- using multiple observations in combination to constrain a\nparameterised source population. Assuming that the scaling of EMRI rate with\nblack hole mass is known and taking a black hole distribution given by a simple\npower law, dn/d(ln M) = A (M/M_*)^b, we find that LISA could measure the\nparameters to a precision of D(ln A) ~ 0.08, and D(b) ~ 0.03 for a reference\nmodel that predicts ~1000 events. Even with as few as 10 events, LISA should\nconstrain the slope to a precision ~0.3, which is the current level of\nobservational uncertainty in the low-mass slope of the black hole mass\nfunction.

The\ninverse Bruggeman homogenization formalism was first used to determine the\nnanoscale model parameters of the CSTF. These parameters then served as inputs\nto the forward Bruggeman homogenization formalism to determine the reference\nrelative permittivity dyadic of the infiltrated CSTF. By solving the\ncoresponding boundary-value problem for a modified Kretschmann configuration,\nthe characteristics of the multiple SPP modes at the planar interface were\ninvestigated as functions of the refractive index of the fluid infiltrating the\nCSTF and the rise angle of the CSTF. The SPP sensitivities thereby revealed\nbode well for the implementation of fluid-infiltrated CSTFs as SPP-based\noptical sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2010 11:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

This result is surprising in that it\nseems to violate the classic Bohr-van Leeuwen Theorem on the absence of\nclassical diamagnetism. It was indeed questioned by some workers [EPL, 89,\n(2010) 37001] who verified that the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation derived from\nour Langevin equation, was satisfied by the classical canonical density in the\nsteady state, obtained by setting d/dt=0 in the FP equation. Inasmuch as the\ncanonical density does not contain the magnetic field, they concluded that the\ndiamagnetic moment must be zero. The purpose of this note is to show that this\nargument and the conclusion are invalid -- instead of setting d/dt=0 one must\nfirst obtain the fundamental time-dependent solution for the FP equation, and\nthen calculate the expectation value of the diamagnetic moment, and finally\nconsider its long-time limit (i.e., $t \\to \\infty$). This would indeed\ncorrespond to our numerical simulation of the dynamics. That this is indeed so\nis shown by considering the simpler analytically solvable problem, namely that\nfor an unbounded plane for which the above procedure can be carried out\nexactly. We then find that the limiting value for the expectation of the\ndiamagnetic moment is indeed non-zero, and yet the steady-state FP equation\nobtained by setting d/dt=0 is satisfied by the canonical density. Admittedly,\nthe exact analytical solution for the sphere is not available. But, the exact\nsolution obtained for the case of the unbounded 2D-plane illustrates our point\nall right.

The stripe-like spin arrangement of Fe moments in the magnetically\nordered state shows the identical in-plane structure for the RFeAsO (R=rare\nearth) and AFe2As2 (A=Sr, Ca, Ba, Eu and K) parent compounds, notably different\nthan the spin configuration of the cuprates.

Studies of\nthe spin dynamics in the parent compounds shows that the interactions are best\ncharacterized as anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) interactions.

This is often achieved by the use of evolutionary\ntracks and isochrones, but the mass result is only as reliable as the models\nused. The recent paper by Torres et al (2009) showed that accurate values for\nstellar masses and radii could be obtained from a calibration using T_eff, log\ng and [Fe/H]. We investigate whether a similarly good calibration can be\nobtained by substituting log rho - the fundamental parameter measured for the\nhost star of a transiting planet - for log g, and apply this to star-exoplanet\nsystems. We perform a polynomial fit to stellar binary data provided in Torres\net al (2009) to obtain the stellar mass and radius as functions of T_eff, log\nrho and [Fe/H], with uncertainties on the fit produced from a Monte Carlo\nanalysis. We apply the resulting equations to measurements for seventeen\nSuperWASP host stars, and also demonstrate the application of the calibration\nin a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to obtain accurate system parameters\nwhere spectroscopic estimates of effective stellar temperature and metallicity\nare available. We show that the calibration using log rho produces accurate\nvalues for the stellar masses and radii; we obtain masses and radii of the\nSuperWASP stars in good agreement with isochrone analysis results. We ascertain\nthat the mass calibration is robust against uncertainties resulting from poor\nphotometry, although a good estimate of stellar radius requires good-quality\ntransit light curve to determine the duration of ingress and egress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2010 15:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This gives rise to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations from\nthe quartic, fermionic interaction to various Gaussian terms of self-energy\nmatrices. We accomplish path integrals of even-valued self-energy matrices with\nEuclidean integration measure where three cases of increasing complexity are\nclassified (scalar self-energy variable, density-related self-energy matrix and\nalso a self-energy including anomalous-doubled terms). According to the\ndriving, anomalous-doubled Hamiltonian part, we also specify the case of a SSB\nwith 'hinge' fields which factorizes the total self-energy matrix by a coset\ndecomposition into density-related, block diagonal self-energy matrices of a\nbackground functional and into coset matrices with off-diagonal block\ngenerators for the anomalous pairings of fermions. In particular we investigate\nthe transformation from the coset fields of a curved coset space, as the\nindependent field degrees of freedom, to locally 'flat' fields with Euclidean\nintegration measure. This allows to reduce the final path integral to solely\n'Nambu'-doubled fields after a saddle point approximaton for the\ndensity-related self-energy matrices and also allows to derive classical field\nequations for exciton quasi-particles from various kinds of gradient expansions\nof the determinant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2010 15:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

Thus we proved that NP=P. The key points of this paper\nare: 1) there are two ways to get a Hamilton cycle in exponential time: a full\npermutation of n vertices; or, chose n edges from all k edges, and check all\npossible combinations. The main problem is: how to avoid checking all\ncombinations of n edges from all edges. My algorithm can avoid this. Lemma 1\nand lemma 2 are very important. They are the foundation that we always can get\na good branch in the depth-first search tree and can get a series of destroying\nedges (all are bad edges) for this good branch in polynomial time. The\nextraordinary insights are: destroying edges, a tree contains each main segment\nat most one time at the same time, and dynamic combinations. The difficult part\nis to understand how to construct a main segment's series of destroying edges\nby dynamic combinations. The proof logic is: if there is at least on Hamilton\ncycle in the graph, we always can do useful cut and inserts until a Hamilton\ncycle is got. The times of useful cut and inserts are polynomial. So if at any\nstep we cannot have a useful cut and insert, this means that there are no\nHamilton cycles in the graph.
