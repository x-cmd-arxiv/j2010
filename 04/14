The\nunderlying objective is to understand how to select search results presentation\nfor tasks and user contexts. Twenty three participants conducted four search\ntasks of two types and used two interfaces (List and Overview) to refine and\nexamine search results. Clickthrough data were recorded. This controlled study\nemployed a mixed model design with two within-subject factors (task and\ninterface) and two between-subject factors (two cognitive abilities: memory\nspan and verbal closure). Quantitative analyses were carried out by means of\nthe statistical package SPSS. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance\nwith repeated measures and non-parametric tests were performed on the collected\ndata. The overview of search results appeared to have benefited searchers in\nseveral ways. It made them faster; it facilitated formulation of more effective\nqueries and helped to assess search results. Searchers with higher cognitive\nabilities were faster in the Overview interface and in less demanding\nsituations (on simple tasks), while at the same time they issued about the same\nnumber of queries as lower-ability searchers. In more demanding situations (on\ncomplex tasks and in the List interface), the higher ability searchers expended\nmore search effort, although they were not significantly slower than the lower\nability people in these situations. The higher search effort, however, did not\nresult in a measurable improvement of task outcomes for high-ability searchers.\nThese findings have implications for the design of search interfaces. They\nsuggest benefits of providing result overviews. They also suggest the\nimportance of considering cognitive abilities in the design of search results'\npresentation and interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 16:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-14"}

The OA coated samples were produced with different magnetic\nconcentrations (78, 76, and 65%) and the DA sample with 63% of Fe3O4. Images\nfrom TEM indicate that the NP have a nearly spherical geometry and mean\ndiameter ~ 5.5 nm. Magnetization measurements, performed in zero field cooled\n(ZFC) and field cooled (FC) processes under different external magnetic fields\nH, exhibited a maximum at a given temperature TB in the ZFC curves, which\ndepends on the NP coating (OA or DA), magnetite concentration, and H. The\ntemperature TB decreases monotonically with increasing H and, for a given H,\nthe increase in the magnetite concentration results in an increase of TB. The\nobserved behavior is related to the dipolar interaction (DI) between NP which\nseems to be an important mechanism in all samples studied. This is supported by\nthe results of the ac magnetic susceptibility Xac measurements, where the\ntemperature in which X' peaks for different frequencies follows the\nVogel-Fulcher model, a feature commonly found in systems with dipolar\ninteractions.

This\nis typically the case in the presence of structural inhomogeneities which are\ninherent to all structurally disordered states of matter below close packing.\nAs a consequence, the macroscopic response to external fields of either fluid\nor arrested disordered states is not well understood. In order to disentangle\nthis complexity, in this work we build upon a simple yet seemingly powerful\nconcept. This can be summarized as follows: the mesoscopic length-scale of\nstructural inhomogeneities is assumed to be the characteristic length-scale of\nthe effective building blocks, while the degrees of freedom of the primary\nparticles are integrated out.

We populate a rich\nparameter space by obtaining independent measurements of density on different\nscales for each galaxy, avoiding the implicit assumptions involved, e.g., in\nthe construction of group catalogues. As the first application of this method,\nwe study how the bimodality in galaxy colour distribution (u-r) depends on\nmultiscale density. The u-r galaxy colour distribution is described as the sum\nof two gaussians (red and blue) with five parameters: the fraction of red\ngalaxies (f_r) and the position and width of the red and blue peaks (mu_r,\nmu_b, sigma_r and sigma_b). Galaxies mostly react to their smallest scale (<\n0.5 Mpc) environments: in denser environments red galaxies are more common\n(larger f_r), redder (larger mu_r) and with a narrower distribution (smaller\nsigma_r), while blue galaxies are redder (larger mu_b) but with a broader\ndistribution (larger sigma_b). There are residual correlations of f_r and mu_b\nwith 0.5 - 1 Mpc scale density, which imply that total or partial truncation of\nstar formation can relate to a galaxy's environment on these scales. Beyond 1\nMpc (0.5 Mpc for mu_r) there are no positive correlations with density. However\nf_r (mu_r) anti-correlates with density on >2 (1) Mpc scales at fixed density\non smaller scales. We examine these trends qualitatively in the context of the\nhalo model, utilizing the properties of haloes within which the galaxies are\nembedded, derived by Yang et al, 2007 and applied to a group catalogue. This\nyields an excellent description of the trends with multiscale density,\nincluding the anti-correlations on large scales, which map the region of\naccretion onto massive haloes.

At the same time, a handful of extremely\npowerful AGN outbursts have recently been detected in clusters, with a total\nenergy ~10^{61}-10^{62} erg. Using two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we\nshow that if a large fraction of this energy is deposited near the centers of\nCC clusters, which is likely common due to dense cores, these AGN outbursts can\ncompletely remove CCs, transforming them to NCC clusters. Our model also has\ninteresting implications for cluster abundance profiles, which usually show a\ncentral peak in CC systems. Our calculations indicate that during the CC to NCC\ntransformation, AGN outbursts efficiently mix metals in cluster central\nregions, and may even remove central abundance peaks if they are not broad\nenough. For CC clusters with broad central abundance peaks, AGN outbursts\ndecrease peak abundances, but can not effectively destroy the peaks. Our model\nmay simultaneously explain the contradictory (possibly bimodal) results of\nabundance profiles in NCC clusters, some of which are nearly flat, while others\nhave strong central peaks similar to those in CC clusters.

For odd Nc, this leaves one unpaired quark, which\ncarries the spin and isospin of the nucleon. If the unpaired quark is in a\nspatial wavefunction orthogonal to the wavefunctions of the scalar diquarks,\nthen up to logarithms of Nc, the unpaired quark only costs an energy \\sim\nLambda_QCD.

Finally, the relative distributions of O stars and\nsubclusters of YSOs as compared to dust pillars shows that while some YSOs are\nlocated within pillars, many more stars and YSOs reside just outside pillar\nheads. We suggest that pillars are transient phenomena, part of a continuous\noutwardly propagating wave of star formation driven by massive star feedback.\nAs pillars are destroyed, they leave newly formed stars in their wake, which\nare then subsumed into the young OB association. Altogether, the current\ngeneration of YSOs shows no strong deviation from a normal IMF. The number of\nYSOs suggests a roughly constant star-formation rate over the past 3Myr,\nimplying that star formation in pillars constitutes an important mechanism to\nconstruct unbound OB associations.

We investigated four typical arrangements of the ptKDs, which are\nforward and backward disk-staggers combined with forward and backward tips.\nNumerical simulations under a certain feed rate and screw revolution speed were\nperformed, and the mixing process was investigated using Lagrangian statistics.\nIt was found that the four types had different mixing characteristics, and\ntheir mixing processes were explained by the coupling effect of drag flow with\nthe disk staggering and pitched-tip and pressure flows, which are controlled by\noperational conditions. The use of a pitched-tip effectively to controls the\nbalance of the pressurization and mixing ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 21:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 14:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

We begin with a convex optimization method based\non the paper ``Minimizing Effective Resistance of a Graph'' [Ghosh, Boyd \\&\nSaberi]. We show that this (DC) resistive network method can be adapted to the\ncontext of AC power flow. However, that does not address the combinatorial\naspect of selecting network structure. We approach this problem as selecting a\nsubgraph within an over-complete network, posed as minimizing the (convex)\nnetwork power dissipation plus a non-convex cost on line conductances that\nencourages sparse networks where many line conductances are set to zero. We\ndevelop a heuristic approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem\nusing: (1) a continuation method to interpolate from the smooth, convex problem\nto the (non-smooth, non-convex) combinatorial problem, (2) the\nmajorization-minimization algorithm to perform the necessary intermediate\nsmooth but non-convex optimization steps. Ultimately, this involves solving a\nsequence of convex optimization problems in which we iteratively reweight a\nlinear cost on line conductances to fit the actual non-convex cost. Several\nexamples are presented which suggest that the overall method is a good\nheuristic for network design.

In the simulations, a weak vertical uniform magnetic\nfield is imposed in a region of fully developed granular convection; and the\ntotal magnetic flux through the top and bottom boundaries is kept constant. The\nsimulation results reveal a process of spontaneous formation of stable magnetic\nstructures, which may be a key to understanding of the magnetic\nself-organization on the Sun and formation of pores and sunspots. This process\nconsists of two basic steps: 1) formation of small-scale filamentary magnetic\nstructures associated with concentrations of vorticity and whirlpool-type\nmotions, and 2) merging of these structures due to the vortex attraction,\ncaused by converging downdrafts around magnetic concentration below the\nsurface. In the resulting large-scale structure maintained by the converging\nplasma motions, the magnetic field strength reaches ~1.5 kG at the surface and\n~6 kG in the interior; and the surface structure resembles solar pores.

Such systems have been\nsuccessfully adopted in large-scale services for content delivery networks,\nfile sharing, and data storage. In small-scale systems, they can be useful to\naddress privacy concerns and for network applications that lack dedicated\nservers. The bootstrap problem, finding an existing peer in the overlay,\nremains a challenge to enabling these services for small-scale P2P systems. In\nlarge networks, the solution to the bootstrap problem has been the use of\ndedicated services, though creating and maintaining these systems requires\nexpertise and resources, which constrain their usefulness and make them\nunappealing for small-scale systems. This paper surveys and summarizes\nrequirements that allow peers potentially constrained by network connectivity\nto bootstrap small-scale overlays through the use of existing public overlays.\nIn order to support bootstrapping, a public overlay must support the following\nrequirements: a method for reflection in order to obtain publicly reachable\naddresses, so peers behind network address translators and firewalls can\nreceive incoming connection requests; communication relaying to share public\naddresses and communicate when direct communication is not feasible; and\nrendezvous for discovering remote peers, when the overlay lacks stable\nmembership. After presenting a survey of various public overlays, we identify\ntwo overlays that match the requirements: XMPP overlays, such as Google Talk\nand Live Journal Talk, and Brunet, a structured overlay based upon Symphony.

In the present paper, we theoretically\ncompare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information\ncriterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is\nasymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a\nrandom variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization\nusing these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the\nBayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is\nasymptotically equal to $2\\lambda/n$, where $\\lambda$ is the real log canonical\nthreshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation\nbetween the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined\nby the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine.

Among various\nstyles of tree drawings reported in the literature, the balloon drawing enjoys\na desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion.\nFor each internal node in a balloon drawing, the ray from the node to each of\nits children divides the wedge accommodating the subtree rooted at the child\ninto two sub-wedges. Depending on whether the two sub-wedge angles are required\nto be identical or not, a balloon drawing can further be divided into two\ntypes: even sub-wedge and uneven sub-wedge types. In the most general case, for\nany internal node in the tree there are two dimensions of freedom that affect\nthe quality of a balloon drawing: (1) altering the order in which the children\nof the node appear in the drawing, and (2) for the subtree rooted at each child\nof the node, flipping the two sub-wedges of the subtree. In this paper, we give\na comprehensive complexity analysis for optimizing balloon drawings of rooted\ntrees with respect to angular resolution, aspect ratio and standard deviation\nof angles under various drawing cases depending on whether the tree is of even\nor uneven sub-wedge type and whether (1) and (2) above are allowed.

We find that: a)\nThe Fe Kalpha line is always centered at 1.9387 +- 0.0016 Angstroms, compatible\nwith Fe I up to Fe X; we detect no shifts to higher ionization states nor any\ndifference between HMXBs and LMXBs. b) The line is very narrow, with FWHM < 5\nmAngstroms, which means that the reprocessing material is not rotating at high\nspeeds. c) Fe Kalpha fluorescence is present in all the HMXB in the survey\nwhile such emissions are very rare (~ 10% ) among LMXBs. d) The lack of Fe line\nemission is always accompanied by the lack of any detectable K edge. e) We\nobtain the empirical curve of growth of the equivalent width of the Fe Kalpha\nline versus the density column of the reprocessing material, i.e. EW_{Kalpha}\nvs N_{H}, and show that it is consistent with a reprocessing region spherically\ndistributed around the compact object. f) We show that fluorescence in X-ray\nbinaries follows the X-ray Baldwin effect. We interpret this finding as\nevidence of decreasing neutral Fe abundance with increasing X-ray illumination\nand use it to explain some spectral states of Cyg X-1 and as a possible cause\nof the lack of narrow Fe line emission in LMXBs. g) Finally, we study anomalous\nmorphologies. We present the first evidence of a Compton shoulder in the HMXB\nX1908+075. Also the Fe Kalpha lines of 4U1700-37 and LMC X-4 present asymmetric\nwings suggesting the presence of highly structured stellar winds in these\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 08:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

By\nstudying the full flow in moduli space in this paper we investigate this\ndistillation procedure in more detail. We introduce a three-qubit state with\namplitudes depending on the conserved charges the warp factor, and the moduli.\nWe show that for the recently discovered non-BPS solutions it is possible to\nsee how the distillation procedure unfolds itself as we approach the horizon.\nFor the non-BPS seed solutions at the asymptotically Minkowski region we are\nstarting with a three-qubit state having seven nonequal nonvanishing amplitudes\nand finally at the horizon we get a GHZ state with merely four nonvanishing\nones with equal magnitudes. The magnitude of the surviving nonvanishing\namplitudes is proportional to the macroscopic black hole entropy. A systematic\nstudy of such attractor states shows that their properties reflect the\nstructure of the fake superpotential. We also demonstrate that when starting\nwith the very special values for the moduli corresponding to flat directions\nthe uniform structure at the horizon deteriorates due to errors generalizing\nthe usual bit flips acting on the qubits of the attractor states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 08:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

With the increased photon\nstatistics, the center of the gamma-ray emitting region is now measured to be\nseparated by only 0.46' from the nucleus of NGC1275, well within the 95%\nconfidence error circle with radius ~1.5'. Early Fermi-LAT observations\nrevealed a significant decade-timescale brightening of NGC1275 at GeV photon\nenergies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by the\nupper limit from previous EGRET observations. With the accumulation of one-year\nof Fermi-LAT all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectral\nvariations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. The\naverage >100 MeV gamma-ray spectrum of NGC1275 shows a possible deviation from\na simple power-law shape, indicating a spectral cut-off around an observed\nphoton energy of E = 42.2+-19.6 GeV, with an average flux of F = (2.31+-0.13) X\n10^{-7} ph/cm^2/s and a power-law photon index, Gamma = 2.13+-0.02. The largest\ngamma-ray flaring event was observed in April--May 2009 and was accompanied by\nsignificant spectral variability above E > 1-2 GeV. The gamma-ray activity of\nNGC1275 during this flare can be described by a hysteresis behavior in the flux\nversus photon index plane. The highest energy photon associated with the\ngamma-ray source was detected at the very end of the observation, with the\nobserved energy of E = 67.4GeV and an angular separation of about 2.4' from the\nnucleus.

No secret is revealed with fewer than k\nshares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality\nof the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original\nsecret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is\nprinted on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment\nor the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that\nin the original secret, could be troublesome. Liu et al. [4] has noticed this\nalignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may\nstill be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the\nhorizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to\nconstruct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks\nfor the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of\nredundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme\nthat allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and\nvertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the\nreconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a\nshift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the\ntraditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very\nlittle shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method\ninvolves a larger pixel expansion. The basic building block of our scheme is\nduplication and concatenation of certain rows or columns of the basic matrices.\nThis seemingly simple but very powerful construction principle can be easily\nused to create more general (k, n)-VSS schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 09:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

Unfortunately, there\nis no algorithm capable of learning the complete class of deterministic regular\nexpressions from positive examples only, as we will show. The regular\nexpressions occurring in practical DTDs and XSDs, however, are such that every\nalphabet symbol occurs only a small number of times. As such, in practice it\nsuffices to learn the subclass of deterministic regular expressions in which\neach alphabet symbol occurs at most k times, for some small k. We refer to such\nexpressions as k-occurrence regular expressions (k-OREs for short). Motivated\nby this observation, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that learns k-OREs\nfor increasing values of k, and selects the deterministic one that best\ndescribes the sample based on a Minimum Description Length argument. The\neffectiveness of the method is empirically validated both on real world and\nsynthetic data. Furthermore, the method is shown to be conservative over the\nsimpler classes of expressions considered in previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 10:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

In selecting galaxies from the Millennium Simulation for this study,\nwe show that using rest-frame criteria significantly improves the homogeneity\nof the sample and that H(z) can be recovered to within 3% at z~0.42 even when\nextended star formation histories are considered. We demonstrate explicitly\nthat using Single Stellar Populations to age-date galaxies from the\nsemi-analytical simulations provides insufficient accuracy for this experiment\nbut accurate ages are obtainable if the complex star formation histories\nextracted from the simulation are used. We note, however, that problems with\nSSP-fitting might be overestimated since the semi-analytical models tend to\nover predict the late-time star-formation in LRGs.

Three MHD simulations of the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) in the unstratified shearing box with zero\nnet flux are presented. These simulations are performed with the code Zeus and\nconsider the evolution of the rate of angular momentum transport as Re is\ngradually increased from 3125 to 12500 while simultaneously keeping Pm=4. To\nensure that the small scale features of the flow are well resolved, the\nresolution varies from 128 cells per disk scaleheight to 512 cells per\nscaleheight.
