Contrarily to\nprevious similar studies, our calculations are based on the complete tidal\nevolution equations of the Hut model, valid at any order in eccentricity,\nobliquity and spin. We demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that,\nexcept if the system was formed with a nearly circular orbit (e<0.2), solving\nconsistently the complete tidal equations is mandatory to derive correct tidal\nevolution histories. We show that calculations based on tidal models truncated\nat second order in eccentricity, as done in all previous studies, lead to\nerroneous tidal evolutions. As a consequence, tidal energy dissipation rates\nare severely underestimated in all these calculations and the characteristic\ntimescales for the various orbital parameters evolutions can be wrong by up to\nthree orders in magnitude.\n  Based on these complete, consistent calculations, we revisit the viability of\nthe tidal heating hypothesis to explain the anomalously large radius of\ntransiting giant planets. We show that, even though tidal dissipation does\nprovide a substantial contribution to the planet's heat budget and can explain\nsome of the moderately bloated hot-Jupiters, this mechanism can not explain\nalone the properties of the most inflated objects, including HD 209458b.\nIndeed, solving the complete tidal equations shows that enhanced tidal\ndissipation and thus orbit circularization occur too early during the planet's\nevolution to provide enough extra energy at the present epoch. In that case\nanother mechanisms, such as stellar irradiation induced surface winds\ndissipating in the planet's tidal bulges, or inefficient convection in the\nplanet's interior must be invoked, together with tidal dissipation, to provide\nall the pieces of the abnormally large exoplanet puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2010 19:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The particle spectrum with all of its symmetries is derived,\nalmost uniquely, under the assumption of irreducibility and of dimension 6\nmodulo 8 for the finite space. The reduction from the natural symmetry group\nSU(2)xSU(2)xSU(4) to U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) is a consequence of the hypothesis that\nthe two layers of space-time are finite distance apart but is non-dynamical.\nThe square of the Dirac operator, and all geometrical invariants that appear in\nthe calculation of the heat kernel expansion are evaluated. We re-derive the\nleading order terms in the spectral action. The geometrical action yields\nunification of all fundamental interactions including gravity at very high\nenergies.

While most of these companies already offer\nwireless products for measurement and monitoring purposes, the ultimate goal is\nto be able to close feedback loops over wireless networks interconnecting\nsensors, computation devices, and actuators. In this paper we present a\ndecentralized event-triggered implementation, over sensor/actuator networks, of\ncentralized nonlinear controllers. Event-triggered control has been recently\nproposed as an alternative to the more traditional periodic execution of\ncontrol tasks. In a typical event-triggered implementation, the control signals\nare kept constant until the violation of a condition on the state of the plant\ntriggers the re-computation of the control signals. The possibility of reducing\nthe number of re-computations, and thus of transmissions, while guaranteeing\ndesired levels of performance makes event-triggered control very appealing in\nthe context of sensor/actuator networks. In these systems the communication\nnetwork is a shared resource and event-triggered implementations of control\nlaws offer a flexible way to reduce network utilization. Moreover reducing the\nnumber of times that a feedback control law is executed implies a reduction in\ntransmissions and thus a reduction in energy expenditures of battery powered\nwireless sensor nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2010 00:57:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 10:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-04"}

By moving and\nvarying the added mass, one pair of modes was successfully brought into a\npseudo-degeneracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2010 07:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The pulsar wind is contained by the stellar wind\nof the O or Be companion, creating a relativistic comet-like structure\naccompanying the pulsar along its orbit. The X-ray and the very high energy\n(>100 GeV, VHE) gamma-ray emissions from the binary LS 5039 are modulated on\nthe orbital period of the system. Maximum and minimum flux occur at the\nconjunctions of the orbit, suggesting that the explanation is linked to the\norbital geometry. The VHE modulation has been proposed to be due to the\ncombined effect of Compton scattering and pair production on stellar photons,\nboth of which depend on orbital phase. The X-ray modulation could be due to\nrelativistic Doppler boosting in the comet tail where both the X-ray and VHE\nphotons would be emitted. Relativistic aberrations change the seed stellar\nphoton flux in the comoving frame so Doppler boosting affects synchrotron and\ninverse Compton emission differently. The dependence with orbital phase of\nrelativistic Doppler-boosted (isotropic) synchrotron and (anisotropic) inverse\nCompton emission is calculated, assuming that the flow is oriented radially\naway from the star (LS 5039) or tangentially to the orbit (LS I +61 303, PSR\nB1259-63). Doppler boosting of the synchrotron emission in LS 5039 produces a\nlightcurve whose shape corresponds to the X-ray modulation. The observations\nimply an outflow velocity of 0.15-0.33c consistent with the expected flow speed\nat the pulsar wind termination shock. In LS I +61 303, the calculated Doppler\nboosted emission peaks in phase with the observed VHE and X-ray maximum.\nDoppler boosting might provide an explanation for the puzzling phasing of the\nVHE peak in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2010 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
