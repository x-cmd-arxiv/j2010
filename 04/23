This lensing is a source of uncertainty in the distance\ndetermination, even in the limit of perfect standard candle measurements. It is\ncommonly believed that the uncertainty in the distance to an ensemble of\ngravitational wave sources is limited by the standard deviation of the lensing\nmagnification distribution divided by the square root of the number of sources.\nHere we show that by exploiting the non-Gaussian nature of the lensing\nmagnification distribution, we can improve this distance determination,\ntypically by a factor of 2--3; we provide a fitting formula for the effective\ndistance accuracy as a function of redshift for sources where the lensing noise\ndominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 19:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 07:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}

This type of coupled quantum wells consists of an electron layer in\nthe InAs quantum well and a hole layer in the GaSb quantum well, forming the\nso-called two dimensional electron-hole bilayer system. Unlike the samples\nstudied in the past, the hybridization of the electron and hole subbands in our\nsamples is largely reduced by having narrower wells and an AlSb barrier layer\ninterposed between the InAs and the GaSb quantum wells, rendering them weakly\nhybridized. Previous studies have revealed multiple absorption modes near the\nelectron cyclotron resonance of the InAs layer in moderately and strongly\nhybridized samples, while only a single absorption mode was observed in the\nweakly hybridized samples. We have observed a pair of absorption modes\noccurring only at magnetic fields higher than 14T, which exhibited several\ninteresting phenomena. Among which we found two unique types of behavior that\ndistinguishes this work from the ones reported in the literature. This pair of\nmodes is very robust against rising thermal excitations and increasing magnetic\nfields alligned parallel to the heterostructures. While the previous results\nwere aptly explained by the antilevel crossing gap due to the hybridization of\nthe electron and hole wavefunctions, i.e. conduction-valence Landau level\nmixing, the unique features reported in this paper cannot be explained within\nthe same concept. The unusual properties found in this study and their\nconnection to the known models for InAs/GaSb heterostructures will be\ndisccused; in addition, several alternative ideas will be proposed in this\npaper and it appears that a spontaneous phase separation can account for most\nof the observed features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 19:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 20:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We discuss\nreasons why the {\\it WMAP} data are unlikely to suffer from this particular\nsystematic effect, including the implications for observations of point\nsources. Given this evidence against the reality of the effect, the similarity\nbetween the pointing-offset-induced signal and the actual quadrupole then\nappears to be quite puzzling. However, we find that the effect arises from a\nconvolution between the gradient of the dipole field and anisotropic coverage\nof the scan direction at each pixel. There is something of a directional\nconspiracy here -- the dipole signal lies close to the Ecliptic Plane, and its\ndirection, together with the {\\it WMAP} scan strategy, results in a strong\ncoupling to the $Y_{2,\\,-1}$ component in Ecliptic co-ordinates. The dominant\nstrength of this component in the measured quadrupole suggests that one should\nexercise increased caution in interpreting its estimated amplitude.

Our sample of equal-mass merger models encompasses\nvarious masses and spatial resolutions, ranging from about 200pc and 10^5\nparticles per component, typical of some recently published major merger\nsimulations, to up to 32pc and 10^3 M_sun in simulations using 2.4 x 10^7\ncollisionless particles and 1.2 x 10^7 gas particles, among the highest\nresolutions reached so far for gas-rich major merger of massive disc galaxies.\nWe find that the formation of fast-rotating early-type galaxies, that are\nflattened by a significant residual rotation, is overall correctly reproduced\nat all such resolutions. However, the formation of slow-rotating early-type\ngalaxies, which have a low residual angular momentum and are supported mostly\nby anisotropic velocity dispersions, is strongly resolution-dependent. The\nevacuation of angular momentum from the main stellar body is largely missed at\nstandard resolution, and systems that should be slow rotators are then found to\nbe fast rotators. The effect is most important for gas-rich mergers, but is\nalso witnessed in mergers with an absent or modest gas component.

Broussous and S. Stevens studied maps between enlarged Bruhat-Tits\nbuildings to construct types for p-adic unitary groups. They needed maps which\nrespect the Moy-Prasad filtrations. That property is called (CLF), i.e.\ncompatibility with the Lie algebra filtrations. In the first part of this\nthesis we generalise their results on such maps to the Quaternion-algebra case.\nLet k0 be a p-adic field of residue characteristic not two. We consider a\nsemisimple k0-rational Lie algebra element beta of a unitary group G:=U(h)\ndefined over k0 with a signed hermitian form h. Let H be the centraliser of\nbeta in G. We prove the existence of an affine H(k0)-equivariant CLF-map j from\nthe enlarged Bruhat-Tits building B^1(H,k0) to B^1(G,k0). As conjectured by\nBroussous the CLF-property determines j, if none of the factors of H is\nk0-isomorphic to the isotropic orthogonal group of k0-rank one and all factors\nare unitary groups. Under the weaker assumption that the affine CLF-map j is\nonly equivariant under the center of H^0(k0) it is uniquely determined up to a\ntranslation of B^1(H,k0).

Previous schemes\nmade use of a four-crystal fixed-exit monochromator in Bragg geometry. In such\nmonochromator the X-ray pulse acquires a cm-long path delay, which must be\ncompensated. For a single-bunch self-seeding scheme this requires a long\nelectron beam bypass, implying modifications of the baseline undulator\nconfiguration. To avoid this problem, a double bunch self-seeding scheme based\non a special photoinjector setup was recently proposed. At variance, here we\npropose a new time-domain method of monochromatization exploiting a single\ncrystal in the transmission direction, thus avoiding the problem of extra-path\ndelay for the X-ray pulse. The method can be realized using a temporal\nwindowing technique, requiring a magnetic delay for the electron bunch only.\nThe proposed setup is extremely simple and composed of as few as two simple\nelements. These are the crystal and the short magnetic chicane, which\naccomplishes three tasks by itself. It creates an offset for crystal\ninstallation, it removes the electron micro-bunching produced in the first\nundulator, and it acts as a delay line for temporal windowing. Using a single\ncrystal installed within a short magnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, it\nis possible to decrease the bandwidth of the radiation well beyond the XFEL\ndesign down to 10E-5. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb\nthe undulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of\noperation. We present feasibility study and exemplifications for the SASE2 line\nof the European XFEL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 08:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-26"}

An extended condensate wave-function builds-up\nwith a degree of spatial coherence larger than 50% over distances 50 times the\npolariton De Broglie wavelength. The expansion of the condensate is shown to be\ngoverned by the repulsive potential induced by photo-generated excitons within\nthe excitation area. The control of this local potential offers a new and\nversatile method to manipulate extended polariton condensates. As an\nillustration, we demonstrate synchronization of extended condensates via\ncontrolled tunnel coupling and localization of condensates in a trap with\noptically controlled dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 10:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Developing the ideas\nof a number of preceding works we claim that the whole admissibility issue is\nreduced to the selection of a family of \"elementary solutions\", which are\ncertain piecewise constant stationary weak solutions. We refer to such a family\nas a \"germ\". It is well known that (CL) admits many different $L^1$ contractive\nsemigroups, some of which reflects different physical applications. We revisit\na number of the existing admissibility (or entropy) conditions and identify the\ngerms that underly these conditions. We devote specific attention to the\nanishing viscosity\" germ, which is a way to express the \"$\\Gamma$-condition\" of\nDiehl. For any given germ, we formulate \"germ-based\" admissibility conditions\nin the form of a trace condition on the flux discontinuity line $x=0$ (in the\nspirit of Vol'pert) and in the form of a family of global entropy inequalities\n(following Kruzhkov and Carrillo). We characterize those germs that lead to the\n$L^1$-contraction property for the associated admissible solutions. Our\napproach offers a streamlined and unifying perspective on many of the known\nentropy conditions, making it possible to recover earlier uniqueness results\nunder weaker conditions than before, and to provide new results for other less\nstudied problems. Several strategies for proving the existence of admissible\nsolutions are discussed, and existence results are given for fluxes satisfying\nsome additional conditions. These are based on convergence results either for\nthe vanishing viscosity method (with standard viscosity or with specific\nviscosities \"adapted\" to the choice of a germ), or for specific germ-adapted\nfinite volume schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 11:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

To test a standard chemical evolution model for spiral disks in the\nLocal Universe and study the influence of a threshold gas density and different\nefficiencies in the star formation rate (SFR) law on radial gradients\n(abundance, gas and SFR). We adopt a one-infall chemical evolution model where\nthe Galactic disk forms inside-out by means of infall of gas, and we test\ndifferent thresholds and efficiencies in the SFR. The model is scaled to the\ndisk properties of three Local Group galaxies (the Milky Way, M31 and M33) by\nvarying its dependence on the star formation efficiency and the time scale for\nthe infalling gas into the disk. Using this simple model we are able to\nreproduce most of the observed constraints available in the literature for the\nstudied galaxies. The radial oxygen abundance gradients and their time\nevolution are studied in detail. The present day abundance gradients are more\nsensitive to the threshold than to other parameters, while their temporal\nevolutions are more dependent on the chosen SFR efficiency.

Measurement-based quantum computation starts from a highly entangled\nuniversal resource state. For years, clusters states have been the only known\nuniversal resources. Surprisingly, a novel framework namely quantum computation\nin correlation space has opened new routes to implement measurement-based\nquantum computation based on quantum states possessing entanglement properties\ndifferent from cluster states. Here we report an experimental demonstration of\nevery building block of such a model. With a four-qubit and a six-qubit state\nas distinct from cluster states, we have realized a universal set of\nsingle-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates and further Deutsch's\nalgorithm.

We have looked for a similar property in a different\nelectron-doped cuprate family, Sr1-xLaxCuO2, which consists of CuO2 planes\nseparated by Sr/La atoms, and is exempt of the possible influence of magnetic\nrare earth ions. We report in-plane magnetoresistance measurements in the\nnormal state of underdoped, superconducting, c-axis oriented, epitaxial\nSr1-xLaxCuO2 thin films. This probe is sensitive to spin arrangement and we\nfind that the in-plane magnetoresistance, which is negative and does not\nsaturate for T, exhibits an angular dependence when measured upon rotating a\nmagnetic field within the CuO2 planes. The analysis reveals a superposition of\nfourfold and twofold angular oscillations. Both of these increase in amplitude\nwith increasing field and decreasing and appear below a temperature, which gets\nhigher with decreasing doping levels. Our results demonstrate that these\nmagnetoresistance oscillations, also observed for the Ln2-xCexCuO4 (Ln = Nd,\nPr,...) family and attributed to an AF signature, are, without ambiguity, a\nproperty of CuO2 planes. Besides, these oscillations vary with doping in an\nunusual way compared to previous results: fourfold oscillations are essentially\npresent in the more underdoped samples while only twofold oscillations are\nvisible in the less underdoped ones. This intriguing observation appears to be\na consequence of spin dilution with increasing doping level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 15:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-26"}

In particular, clusters show\nstar-to-star abundance variations, and multiple sequences in their\ncolour-magnitude diagrams. These effects seem to be restricted to globular\nclusters, and are not found in open clusters or the field. In this paper, we\ncombine the two competing models for these multiple populations and include a\nconsideration of the effects of stellar collisions. Collisions are one of the\nfew phenomena which occur solely in dense stellar environments like\n(proto-)globular clusters. We find that runaway collisions between massive\nstars can produce material which has abundances comparable to the observed\nsecond generations, but that very little total mass is produced by this\nchannel. We then add the contributions of rapidly-rotating massive stars (under\nthe assumption that massive stars are spun up by collisions and interactions),\nand the contribution of asymptotic giant branch stars. We find that collisions\ncan help produce the extreme abundances which are seen in some clusters.\nHowever, the total amount of material produced in these generations is still\ntoo small (by at least a factor of 10) to match the observations. We conclude\nwith a discussion of the additional effects which probably need to be\nconsidered to solve this particular problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 15:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
