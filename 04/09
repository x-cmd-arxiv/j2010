So\nfar, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,\noxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The\ninterpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the\nabsorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar\nradiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we\nintroduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of\nextrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H\nLy alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean\ntemperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H\ndissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which\ncorrespond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model\nthermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the\natmosphere is mostly ionized. We find that the HI transit depth reflects the\noptical depth of the thermosphere in the wings of the H Ly alpha line but that\nthe atmosphere also overflows the Roche lobe. By assuming a solar mixing ratio\nof oxygen, we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with\nthe observations. An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the\nHI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic\nescape, the O/H ratio is supersolar, or if a significant quantity of neutral\noxygen is found outside the Roche lobe. Due to the large uncertainty in the\ndata, repeated observations are necessary to better constrain the OI transit\ndepths and thus the composition of the thermosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 18:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Systematic surveys of the tunneling spectra\ntaken with Pt/Ir tips reveal spatial variations on the length scale of a few\nhundred nanometers in the ferromagnetic state, which may be attributed to the\nintrinsic heterogeneity of the manganites due to their tendency towards phase\nseparation. The electronic heterogeneity is found to decrease either with\nincreasing field at low temperatures or at temperatures above all magnetic\nordering temperatures.

Moreover, a low-energy insulating energy gap $\\sim\n0.6$ eV commonly found in the tunneling conductance spectra of bulk metallic\nLCMO at $T \\to 0$ may be attributed to a surface ferromagnetic insulating (FI)\nphase, as evidenced by its spin filtering effect at low temperatures and\nvanishing gap value above the Curie temperature.

This phenomenon is still not\ncompletely understood and in particular, little is known about the connection\nbetween the flow history, as a determinant of the initial state of the system,\nand the subsequent aging dynamics. Using a stress controlled rheometer, we\nperform stress jump experiments to observe the elastic component of the flow\nstress that remains on cessation of flow or flow quenching. We investigate the\nconnection between the dynamics of these residual stresses and the rate of\nphysical aging upon quenching from different points on the steady state flow\ncurve. Quenching from high rates produces a fluid state, G\">G', with small,\nfast relaxing residual stresses and rapid, sigmoidal aging of the complex\nmodulus. Conversely, quenching from lower shear rates produces increasingly\njammed states featuring slowly relaxing stresses and a slow increase of the\ncomplex modulus with system age. Flow cessation from a fixed shear rate with\nvarying quench durations shows that slower quenches produce smaller residual\nstresses at short times which relax at long times by smaller extents, by\ncomparison with faster quenches. These smaller stresses are correlated with a\nhigher modulus but slower physical aging of the system. The characteristic time\nfor the residual stress relaxation scales inversely with the quench rate. This\nimplies a frustrated approach to any ideal stress-free state that succinctly\nreflects the frustrated nature of these glassy systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 09:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-12"}

The spiral galaxy NGC 4254 in the Virgo cluster is\nbelieved to be a harassed galaxy. We have analyzed the power spectrum of HI\nemission fluctuations from NGC 4254 to investigate whether it carries any\nimprint of galaxy harassment. The power spectrum, as determined using the 16\ncentral channels which contain most of the HI emission, is found to be well\nfitted by a power law $P(U)=AU^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha\\ =-\\ 1.7\\pm 0.2$ at\nlength-scales $1.7 \\, {\\rm k pc}$ to $ 8.4 \\, {\\rm kpc}$. This is similar to\nother normal spiral galaxies which have a slope of $\\sim -1.5$ and is\ninterpreted as arising from two dimensional turbulence at length-scales larger\nthan the galaxy's scale-height. NGC 4254 is hence yet another example of a\nspiral galaxy that exhibits scale-invariant density fluctuations out to\nlength-scales comparable to the diameter of the HI disk. While a large variety\nof possible energy sources like proto-stellar winds, supernovae, shocks, etc.\nhave been proposed to produce turbulence, it is still to be seen whether these\nare effective on length-scales comparable to that of the entire HI disk. On\nseparately analyzing the HI power spectrum in different parts of NGC 4254, we\nfind that the outer parts have a different slope ($ \\alpha = -2.0\\pm0.3$)\ncompared to the central part of the galaxy ($\\alpha = -1.5\\pm0.2$). Such a\nchange in slope is not seen in other, undisturbed galaxies. We suggest that, in\naddition to changing the overall morphology, galaxy harassment also effects the\nfine scale structure of the ISM, causing the power spectrum to have a steeper\nslope in the outer parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 11:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For Anderson localization transitions, Mirlin and Evers [PRB 62,7920\n(2000)] have proposed the following scenario (a) the Inverse Participation\nRatios (I.P.R.) $Y_q(L)$ display the following fluctuations between the\ndisordered samples of linear size $L$ : with respect to the typical value\n$Y^{typ}_q(L) = e^{\\bar{\\ln Y_q(L)}} \\sim L^{- \\tau_{typ}(q)} $ that involve\nthe typical multifractal spectrum $\\tau_{typ}(q)$, the rescaled variable\n$y=Y_q(L)/Y^{typ}_q(L) $ is distributed with a scale-invariant distribution\npresenting the power-law tail $1/y^{1+\\beta_q}$, so that the disorder-averaged\nI.P.R. $\\bar{Y_q(L)} \\sim L^{- \\tau_{av}(q)} $ have multifractal exponents\n$\\tau_{av}(q) $ that differ from the typical ones $\\tau_{typ}(q)$ whenever\n$\\beta_q<1$; (b) the tail exponents $\\beta_q$ and the multifractal exponents\nare related by the relation $\\beta_q \\tau_{typ}(q)=\\tau_{av}(q \\beta_q)$. Here\nwe show that this scenario can be understood by considering the real-space\nrenormalization equations satisfied by the I.P.R. For the simplest\nmultifractals described by random cascades, these renormalization equations are\nformally similar to the recursion relations for disordered models defined on\nCayley trees and they admit travelling-wave solutions for the variable $(\\ln\nY_q)$ in the effective time $t_{eff}=\\ln L$ : the exponent $\\tau_{typ}(q)$\nrepresents the velocity, whereas the tail exponent $\\beta_q$ represents the\nusual exponential decay of the travelling-wave tail. In addition, we obtain\nthat the relation (b) above can be obtained as a self-consistency condition\nfrom the self-similarity of the multifractal spectrum at all scales. Our\nconclusion is thus that the Mirlin-Evers scenario should apply to other types\nof random critical points, and even to random multifractals occurring in other\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 12:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 12:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

An asymptotic\nsolution is obtained showing that the magnetic field does not affect the shape\neigenmodes, which remain the spherical harmonics as in the non-magnetic case.\nStrong magnetic field, however, constrains the liquid flow associated with the\noscillations and, thus, reduces the oscillation frequencies by increasing\neffective inertia of the liquid. In such a field, liquid oscillates in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) way as solid columns aligned with the field. Two types of\noscillations are possible: longitudinal and transversal to the field. Such\noscillations are weakly damped by a strong magnetic field - the stronger the\nfield, the weaker the damping, except for the axisymmetric transversal and\ninherently 2D modes. The former are overdamped because of being incompatible\nwith the incompressibility constraint, whereas the latter are not affected at\nall because of being naturally invariant along the field. Since the magnetic\ndamping for all other modes decreases inversely with the square of the field\nstrength, viscous damping may become important in a sufficiently strong\nmagnetic field. The viscous damping is found analytically by a simple energy\ndissipation approach which is shown for the longitudinal modes to be equivalent\nto a much more complicated eigenvalue perturbation technique.

However,\nflares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.\nAs time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminosities\nand softer emission. The flare spectral peak energy E_{p,i} evolves to lower\nvalues following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.\nThe two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energy\nE_{iso} and peak luminosity L_{p,iso} when compared to the E_{p,i}-E_{iso} and\nE_{p,i}-L_{iso} prompt correlations. E_{p,i} is found to correlate with L_{iso}\nwithin single flares, giving rise to a time resolved E_{p,i}(t)-L_{iso}(t).\nLike prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: L_{p,iso}^{0.3-10\nkeV} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}. The lag-luminosity is proven to be a fundamental\nlaw extending 5 decades in time and 5 in energy.

Our method allows the calculation of finite-frequency current\ncumulants of arbitrary order, as we explicitly show for the second- and\nthird-order cumulants. Our formulae generalize previous zero-frequency\nexpressions in the literature and can be viewed as an extension of MacDonald's\nformula beyond shot noise. When combined with an appropriate treatment of\ntunneling, using, e.g. Liouvillian perturbation theory in Laplace space, our\nmethod can deal with arbitrary bias voltages and frequencies, as we illustrate\nwith the paradigmatic example of transport through a single resonant level\nmodel. We discuss various interesting limits, including the recovery of the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem near linear response, as well as some drawbacks\ninherent of the Markovian description arising from the neglect of quantum\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 15:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 16:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
