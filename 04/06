In order to control the growth of the problem\ninstances, we introduce \"transversal extensions\" as a natural way of\nconstructing mixed parameter tuples (k_1, ..., k_m) for van-der-Waerden-like\nnumbers N(k_1, ..., k_m), such that the growth of these numbers is guaranteed\nto be linear. Based on Green-Tao's theorem we introduce the \"Green-Tao numbers\"\ngrt(k_1, ..., k_m), which in a sense combine the strict structure of van der\nWaerden problems with the (pseudo-)randomness of the distribution of prime\nnumbers. Using standard SAT solvers (look-ahead, conflict-driven, and local\nsearch) we determine the basic values. It turns out that already for this\nsingle form of Ramsey-type problems, when considering the best-performing\nsolvers a wide variety of solver types is covered.

We\nre-formulate the problem of decoherence control as a disturbance rejection\nscheme which also leads us to the idea of Internal Model Principle for quantum\ncontrol systems which is first of its kind in the literature.\n  It is shown that decoupling a quantum disturbance from an open quantum\nsystem, is possible only with the help of a quantum controller which takes into\naccount the model of the environmental interaction. This is demonstrated for a\nsimple 2-qubit system wherein the effects of decoherence are completely\neliminated. The theory provides conditions to be imposed on the controller to\nensure perfect decoupling. Hence the problem of decoherence control naturally\ngives rise to the quantum internal model principle which relates the\ndisturbance rejecting control to the model of the environmental interaction.\n  Classical internal model principle and disturbance decoupling focus on\ndifferent aspects viz. perfect output tracking and complete decoupling of\noutput from external disturbances respectively. However for quantum systems,\nthe two problems come together and merge in order to produce an effective\nplatform for decoherence control.

Using the numerical\nrenormalization group method, we find a splitting of the Kondo resonance at the\nFermi level which can be compensated by an external magnetic field. To fully\nunderstand the nature of this compensation effect, we perform a scaling\nanalysis and derive an expression for the effective magnetic field. The\nanalysis is based on a tight-binding model which leads to an effective Anderson\nmodel with a spin-dependent density of states for the transformed lead states.\nWe find that the effective field originates from the combined effect of Rashba\ninteraction and magnetic flux and that it contains important corrections due to\nelectron-electron interactions. We show that the compensating field is an\noscillatory function of both the spin-orbit and the Aharonov-Bohm phases.\nMoreover, the effective field never vanishes due to the particle-hole symmetry\nbreaking independently of the gate voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 17:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 12:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-14"}

Because H2\nforms on dust grains, the presence of H2 is physically linked to the survival\nof dust, and we expect some dust emission to come from the molecular gas. To\ntest this interpretation, IR observations and dust modeling are used to\nidentify and characterize the thermal dust emission from the shocked molecular\ngas. The spatial distribution of the IR emission allows us to isolate the faint\nPAH and dust continuum emission associated with the molecular gas in the SQ\nshock. We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of this emission, and\nfit it to Spitzer observations. Faint PAH and dust continuum emission are\ndetected in the SQ shock, outside star-forming regions. The 12/24um flux ratio\nin the shock is remarkably close to that of the diffuse Galactic interstellar\nmedium, leading to a Galactic PAH/VSG abundance ratio. However, the properties\nof the PAH emission spectrum in the shock differ from that of the Galaxy, which\nmay suggest an enhanced fraction of large and neutrals PAHs. The IR SED is\nconsistent with the expected emission from dust associated with the warm\n(>150K) H2 gas, heated by a UV radiation field of intensity comparable to that\nof the solar neighborhood, in agreement with GALEX UV observations. The\npresence of PAHs and dust grains in the high-speed (1000km/s) galaxy collision\nsuggests that dust survives.

Our basic tool is a general formalism for describing the\nmotion of extended test bodies in an external electromagnetic field in curved\nspacetime and possibly subject to other forces. We first show that bobbing of\nexactly the type as observed in numerical simulations of the binary black hole\nsystem occurs in a simple system consisting of two spinning balls connected by\nan elastic band in flat spacetime. This bobbing may be understood as arising\nfrom the difference between a spinning body's \"lab frame centroid\" and its true\ncenter of mass, and is purely \"kinematical\" in the sense that it will appear\nregardless of the forces holding two spinning bodies in orbit. Next, we develop\nprecise rules for relating the motion of charged bodies in a stationary\nexternal electromagnetic field in flat spacetime with the motion of bodies in a\nweakly curved stationary spacetime. We then consider the system consisting of\ntwo orbiting charges with magnetic dipole moment and spin at a level of\napproximation corresponding to 1.5 post-Newtonian order. Here we find that\nconsiderable amounts of momentum are exchanged between the bodies and the\nelectromagnetic field; however, the bodies store this momentum entirely as\n\"hidden\" mechanical momentum, so that the interchange does not give rise to any\nnet bobbing. The net bobbing that does occur is due solely to the kinematical\nspin effect, and we therefore argue that the net bobbing of the electromagnetic\nbinary is not associated with possible kicks. We believe that this conclusion\nholds in the gravitational case as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 18:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 22:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 17:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

This is the probe for investigating\nindirectly the extra 1+1 dimensions which are neither small nor hidden. This 2T\nformalism that originated in 1998 has been extended in recent years from the\nworldline to field theory in d+2 dimensions. This includes 2T field theories\nthat yield 1T field theories for the Standard Model and General Relativity as\nshadows of their counterparts in 4+2 dimensions. Problems of ghosts and\ncausality in a 2T space-time are resolved automatically by the gauge symmetry,\nwhile a higher unification of 1T field theories is obtained. In this lecture\nthe approach will be described at an elementary worldline level, and the\ncurrent status of 2T-physics will be summarized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 19:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 19:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

Linear acceleration emission occurs when a charged particle is\naccelerated parallel to its velocity. We evaluate the spectral and angular\ndistribution of this radiation for several special cases, including constant\nacceleration (hyperbolic motion) of finite duration. Based on these results, we\nfind the following general properties of the emission from an electron in a\nlinear accelerator that can be characterized by an electric field E acting over\na distance L: (i) the spectrum extends to a cut-off photon energy ~ LE^2 MeV,\nwhere E is in units of the Schwinger critical field and L in units of the\nCompton wavelength of the electron. (ii) the total energy emitted by a particle\ntraversing the accelerator is in agreement with the standard Larmor formula\n(iii) the low frequency spectrum is flat for hyperbolic trajectories, but in\ngeneral depends on the details of the accelerator. We also show that linear\nacceleration emission complements curvature radiation in the strongly\nmagnetized pair formation regions in pulsar magnetospheres. It dominates when\nthe length L of the accelerator is less than the formation length of curvature\nphotons, which is given by the ratio of the radius of curvature of the magnetic\nfield lines to the Lorentz factor of the particle. In standard static models of\npair creating regions linear acceleration emission is negligible, but it is\nimportant in more realistic dynamical models in which the accelerating field\nfluctuates on a short length-scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 21:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this scenario, the use of the Dirac equation\nis required for a satisfactory evolution of fermionic mass-eigenstates since in\nthe standard treatment of oscillations the mass-eigenstates are implicitly\nassumed to be scalars and, consequently, the spinorial form of neutrino wave\nfunctions is not included in the calculations. Within first quantized theories,\nbesides flavor oscillations, chiral oscillations automatically appear when we\nset the dynamic equations for a fermionic Dirac-type particle. The left-handed\nchiral nature of created and detected neutrinos can be implemented in the first\nquantized Dirac theory in presence of mixing; the probability loss due to the\nchanging of initially left-handed neutrinos to the undetected right-handed\nneutrinos can be obtained in analytic form. In the context of a causal\nrelativistic theory of a free particle, one of the two effects should be\npresent in flavor oscillations: (a) rapid oscillations or (b) initial flavor\nviolation. Concerning second quantized approaches, a simple second quantized\ntreatment exhibits a tiny but inevitable initial flavor violation without the\npossibility of rapid oscillations. Such effect is a consequence of an\nintrinsically indefinite but approximately well defined neutrino flavor. The\nviolation effects are shown to be much larger than loop induced lepton flavor\nviolation processes, already present in the standard model in the presence of\nmassive neutrinos with mixing.

The results of our\nsimulations showed that the proposed multi-telescope concept of PLATO can\nfulfil the defined scientific goal of measuring more than 20000 cool dwarfs\nbrighter than mV =11 with a precision better than 27 ppm/h which is essential\nfor the study of earth-like exo-planetary systems using the transit method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 23:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-07"}

Under a probabilistic assumption about the possible\ninputs, such a preference order is naturally expressed by a weighted automaton,\nwhich assigns to each word a value, such that a system is preferred if it\ngenerates a higher expected value. We solve the following optimal-synthesis\nproblem: given an omega-regular specification, a Markov chain that describes\nthe distribution of inputs, and a weighted automaton that measures how well a\nsystem satisfies the given specification under the given input assumption,\nsynthesize a system that optimizes the measured value.\n  For safety specifications and measures given by mean-payoff automata, the\noptimal-synthesis problem amounts to finding a strategy in a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) that is optimal for a long-run average reward objective, which\ncan be done in polynomial time. For general omega-regular specifications, the\nsolution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal\nstrategies in MDPs with mean-payoff parity objectives.\n  Our algorithm generates optimal strategies consisting of two memoryless\nstrategies and a counter. This counter is in general not bounded. To obtain a\nfinite-state system, we show how to construct an \\epsilon-optimal strategy with\na bounded counter for any \\epsilon>0. We also show how to decide in polynomial\ntime if we can construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system without\na counter) for a given specification.\n  We have implemented our approach in a tool that takes qualitative and\nquantitative specifications and automatically constructs a system that\nsatisfies the qualitative specification and optimizes the quantitative\nspecification, if such a system exists. We present experimental results showing\noptimal systems that were generated in this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 23:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 18:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}

In the first approximation such a truncation is performed\nby replacing two-particle Green's functions (GFs) in the hierarchy by their\nvalues at equilibrium. The second method is developed based on the cluster\nexpansion, which constructs two-particle GFs from one-particle GFs and neglects\nthe correlation part. A non-equilibrium Wick's Theorem is proved to provide a\nbasis for this non-equilibrium cluster expansion. Using those two\napproximations, our method of solving the Redfield equation, for instance, of\nan N-site chain of interacting spinless fermions, involves an eigenvalue\nproblem with dimension $2^{N}$ and a linear system with dimension $N^2$ in the\nfirst case, and a nonlinear equation with dimension $N^2$ in the second case,\nwhich can be solved iteratively via a sequence of $N^2$ linear systems.

As a test of the methods, for small systems with size N=4, results are\nfound to be consistent with results made available by other direct methods.\nAlthough not discussed here, extending both methods to their next levels is\nstraightforward.

This novel approach\nis based on the fact that Einstein gravity can be formulated in terms of a\nsymplectic geometry rather than a Riemannian geometry in the context of\nemergent gravity. An essential step for emergent gravity is to realize the\nequivalence principle, the most important property in the theory of gravity\n(general relativity), from U(1) gauge theory on a symplectic or Poisson\nmanifold. Through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an\nintrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the\nMoser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from\nnoncommutative U(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the\nnoncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory. As a\nconsequence, a background-independent quantum gravity in which the prior\nexistence of any spacetime structure is not a priori assumed but is defined by\nusing the fundamental ingredients in quantum gravity theory can be formulated.\nThis scheme for quantum gravity can be used to resolve many notorious problems\nin theoretical physics, such as the cosmological constant problem, to\nunderstand the nature of dark energy, and to explain why gravity is so weak\ncompared to other forces. In particular, it leads to a remarkable picture of\nwhat matter is.

This\ndemand has sparked the interest in symbolic control where lower complexity\nmodels of control systems are used to cater for complex specifications given by\ntemporal logics, regular languages, or automata. These specification mechanisms\ncan be regarded as qualitative since they divide the trajectories of the plant\ninto bad trajectories (those that need to be avoided) and good trajectories.\nHowever, many applications require also the optimization of quantitative\nmeasures of the trajectories retained by the controller, as specified by a cost\nor utility function. As a first step towards the synthesis of controllers\nreconciling both qualitative and quantitative specifications, we investigate in\nthis paper the use of symbolic models for time-optimal controller synthesis. We\nconsider systems related by approximate (alternating) simulation relations and\nshow how such relations enable the transfer of time-optimality information\nbetween the systems. We then use this insight to synthesize approximately\ntime-optimal controllers for a control system by working with a lower\ncomplexity symbolic model. The resulting approximately time-optimal controllers\nare equipped with upper and lower bounds for the time to reach a target,\ndescribing the quality of the controller.

One of the main\nproblems in the original mip is the triangle routing problem.

The fundamental physical constants, which are measured\nin different physical environments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar)\ndensities of baryonic matter are supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalar\nfield models, which predict that both masses and coupling constant may depend\non the local matter density. The parameter Delta F/F = (F_obs - F_lab)/F_lab\ncan be estimated from the radial velocity offset, Delta V = V_rot-V_fs, between\nthe low-laying rotational transitions in carbon monoxide 13CO and the\nfine-structure transitions in atomic carbon [CI]. A model-dependent constraint\non Delta alpha/alpha can be obtained from Delta F/F using Delta mu/mu\nindependently measured from the ammonia method. Currently available radio\nastronomical datasets provide an upper limit on |Delta V| < 110 m/s (1sigma).\nWhen interpreted in terms of the spatial variation of F, this gives |Delta F/F|\n< 3.7*10^-{7}. An order of magnitude improvement of this limit will allow us to\ntest independently a non-zero value of Delta mu/mu = (2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/-\n0.3_sys)*10^{-8} recently found with the ammonia method. Taking into account\nthat the ammonia method restricts the spatial variation of mu at the level of\n|Delta mu/mu| <= 3*10^{-8} and assuming that Delta F/F is the same in the\nentire interstellar medium, one obtains that the spatial variation of alpha\ndoes not exceed the value |Delta alpha/alpha| < 2*10^{-7}. Since extragalactic\ngas clouds have densities similar to those in the interstellar medium, the\nbound on Delta alpha/alpha is also expected to be less than 2*10^{-7} at high\nredshift if no significant temporal dependence of alpha is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 06:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

On the other hand, it may happen the data is stored in\nunreliable nodes, while it is desired the end user to have a reliable access to\nthe stored data. So, in an event that a node is damaged, to prevent the system\nreliability to regress, it is necessary to regenerate a new node with the same\namount of stored data as the damaged node to retain the number of storage\nnodes, thereby having the previous reliability. This requires the new node to\nconnect to some of existing nodes and downloads the required information,\nthereby occupying some bandwidth, called the repair bandwidth. On the other\nhand, it is more likely the cost of downloading varies across different nodes.\nThis paper aims at investigating the theoretical cost-bandwidth tradeoff, and\nmore importantly, it is demonstrated that any point on this curve can be\nachieved through the use of the so called generalized regenerating codes which\nis an enhancement of the regeneration codes introduced by Dimakis et al. in\n[1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 07:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 11:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-15"}

We complement this\nphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously\nperformed with SOPHIE at Haute-Provence Observatory. This provides radial\nvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previously\nuncovered with spectroscopy. This new data set allows the parameters of this\nsingular planetary system to be significantly refined. We obtained a\nplanet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lower\nthan the one measured from previous ground observations. We detected a feature\nin the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot.

The sky-projected angle between the\nspin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to\nbe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin\nanomaly. This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitively\nrejected. Over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, a\nfew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two different\nevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if they\nexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body.

Each of users 1 and 2 intends to share a\nsecret key with user 3 where user 1 acts as a wiretapper for user 2 and vice\nversa. In this model, two situations are considered: communication from users 1\nand 2 to user 3 (the forward key strategy) and from user 3 to users 1 and 2\n(the backward key strategy). In both situations, the goal is sharing a secret\nkey between user 1 and user 3 while leaking no effective information about that\nkey to user 2, and simultaneously, sharing another secret key between user 2\nand user 3 while leaking no effective information about the latter key to user\n1.

In this paper, we test the effects of\nthe integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) on the chemical evolution\nof the solar neighbourhood. The IGIMF (Weidner & Kroupa 2005) is computed from\nthe combination of the stellar intial mass function (IMF), i.e. the mass\nfunction of single star clusters, and the embedded cluster mass function, i.e.\na power law with index beta. By taking into account also the fact that the\nmaximum achievable stellar mass is a function of the total mass of the cluster,\nthe IGIMF becomes a time-varying IMF which depends on the star formation rate.\nWe applied this formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solar\nneighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possible\nvalues for beta with the results obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,\nconstant IMF. In general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatter\nIGIMF, hence a larger number of massive stars and larger metal ejection rates.\nThis translates into higher type Ia and II supernova rates, higher mass\nejection rates from massive stars and a larger amount of gas available for star\nformation, coupled with lower present-day stellar mass densities. (abridged) We\nalso discuss the importance of the present day stellar mass function (PDMF) in\nproviding a way to disentangle among various assumptions for beta. Our results\nindicate that the model adopting the IGIMF computed with beta ~2 should be\nconsidered the best since it allows us to reproduce the observed PDMF and to\naccount for most of the chemical evolution constraints considered in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 11:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The two\nplanets have very similar masses but suffer different levels of irradiation and\nare predicted to fall either side of a sharp transition between planets with\nand without hot stratospheres. WASP-1b is one of the most highly irradiated\nplanets studied to date. We measure planet/star contrast ratios in all four of\nthe IRAC bands for both planets (3.6-8.0um), and our results indicate the\npresence of a strong temperature inversion in the atmosphere of WASP-1b,\nparticularly apparent at 8um, and no inversion in WASP-2b.

We\nfit the Spitzer light curves simultaneously with the best available radial\nvelocity curves and transit photometry in order to provide updated measurements\nof system parameters. We do not find significant eccentricity in the orbit of\neither planet, suggesting that the inflated radius of WASP-1b is unlikely to be\nthe result of tidal heating.

In a previous study by the authors, new\neffective temperatures Teff for sixteen metal-poor halo dwarfs were derived\nusing a local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) description of the formation of\nFe lines. This new Teff scale reinforced the discrepancy. For six of the stars\nfrom our previous study we calculate revised temperatures using a non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) approach. These are then used to derive a new\nmean primordial lithium abundance in an attempt to solve the lithium\ndiscrepancy. Using the code MULTI we calculate NLTE corrections to the LTE\nabundances for the Fe I lines measured in the six stars, and determine new\nTeff's. We keep other physical parameters, i.e. log g, [Fe/H] and xi, constant\nat the values calculated in Paper I. With the revised Teff scale we derive new\nLi abundances. We compare the NLTE values of Teff with the photometric\ntemperatures of Ryan et al.

Recent work has shown that by weakening the role of the\nmeasurement in preparing eigenstates of the variable it is in fact possible to\nmeasure all nonlocal observables instantaneously by exploiting entanglement.\nHowever, for these measurement schemes to succeed with certainty an infinite\namount of entanglement must be distributed initially and all this entanglement\nis necessarily consumed. In this work we sharpen the characterisation of\ninstantaneous nonlocal measurements by explicitly devising schemes in which\nonly a finite amount of the initially distributed entanglement is ever\nutilised. This enables us to determine an upper bound to the average\nconsumption for the most general cases of nonlocal measurements. This includes\nthe tasks of state verification, where the measurement verifies if the system\nis in a given state, and verification measurements of a general set of\neigenstates of an observable. Despite its finiteness the growth of entanglement\nconsumption is found to display an extremely unfavourable exponential of an\nexponential scaling with either the number of qubits needed to contain the\nSchmidt rank of the target state or total number of qubits in the system for an\noperator measurement. This scaling is seen to be a consequence of the\ncombination of the generic exponential scaling of unitary decompositions\ncombined with the highly recursive structure of our scheme required to overcome\nthe no-signalling constraint of relativistic causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 14:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 14:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The submillimetre and millimetre dust continuum emission maps\ntogether with the spectral energy distributions are used to model and derive\nthe physical properties of the star-forming cores, such as luminosities, sizes,\nmasses, densities, etc. Comparisons with ground-based near-infrared and\nspace-based mid and far-infrared images from Spitzer are used to reveal the\nstellar content of the Bok globules, association of embedded young stellar\nobjects with the submm dust cores, and the evolutionary stages of the\nindividual sources. Submm dust continuum emission was detected in 26 out of the\n32 globule cores observed. For 18 globules with detected (sub)mm cores we\nderive evolutionary stages and physical parameters of the embedded sources. We\nidentify nine starless cores, most of which are presumably prestellar, nine\nClass 0 protostars, and twelve Class I YSOs. Specific source properties like\nbolometric temperature, core size, and central densities are discussed as\nfunction of evolutionary stage. We find that at least two thirds (16 out of 24)\nof the star-forming globules studied here show evidence of forming multiple\nstars on scales between 1,000 and 50,000 AU. However, we also find that most of\nthese small prototstar and star groups are comprised of sources with different\nevolutionary stages, suggesting a picture of slow and sequential star formation\nin isolated globules\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2010 15:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
