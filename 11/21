Considering static and\nfast-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, the\nenergy-efficiency is defined as the transmission rate to power ratio and shown\nto be maximized at low transmit power. The most interesting case is the one of\nslow fading MIMO channels. For this type of channels, the optimal precoding\nscheme is generally not trivial. Furthermore, using all the available transmit\npower is not always optimal in the sense of energy-efficiency (which, in this\ncase, corresponds to the communication-theoretic definition of the\ngoodput-to-power (GPR) ratio). Finding the optimal precoding matrices is shown\nto be a new open problem and is solved in several special cases: 1. when there\nis only one receive antenna; 2. in the low or high signal-to-noise ratio\nregime; 3. when uniform power allocation and the regime of large numbers of\nantennas are assumed.

The propagation\nmodel used to account for the effects of transmit and receive antenna\ncorrelations is the unitary-invariant-unitary model, which is one of the most\ngeneral models available in the literature. In this context, we introduce and\nanalyze two resource allocation games. In both games, the mobile stations\nselfishly choose their power allocation policies in order to maximize their\nindividual uplink transmission rates; in particular they can ignore some\nspecified centralized policies. In the first game considered, the base station\nimplements successive interference cancellation (SIC) and each mobile station\nchooses his best space-time power allocation scheme; here, a coordination\nmechanism is used to indicate to the users the order in which the receiver\napplies SIC. In the second framework, the base station is assumed to implement\nsingle-user decoding. For these two games a thorough analysis of the Nash\nequilibrium is provided: the existence and uniqueness issues are addressed; the\ncorresponding power allocation policies are determined by exploiting random\nmatrix theory; the sum-rate efficiency of the equilibrium is studied\nanalytically in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes and by\nsimulations in more typical scenarios. Simulations show that, in particular,\nthe sum-rate efficiency is high for the type of systems investigated and the\nperformance loss due to the use of the proposed suboptimum coordination\nmechanism is very small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2010 18:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 17:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

In our\nmodel, the reheating takes place only at the true minimum and even in the case\n(II) finally the tachyonic instability occurs after the termination of\ninflation. For a negative nonminimal coupling, inflation takes place in the\nvacuum-dominated region, in the large field region, or near the local\nminimum/maximum. Inflation in the vacuum dominated region becomes either the\ntype (I) or (II), resulting in blue or red spectrum of the curvature\nperturbations, respectively.

By\nmapping the Wen-plaquette model onto a one-dimensional quantum Ising model, we\ncalculate the expectation value of the plaquette operator Fi during a slowly\nquenching process from a topologically ordered state. A logarithmic scaling law\nof quench dynamics near the quantum phase transition is found, which is\nanalogous to the well-known static critical behavior of the specific heat in\nthe one-dimensional quantum Ising model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2010 15:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 05:32:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 13:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 12:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 04:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Two CIII targets were prepared and\nused to generate theoretical data required in the investigation of\nrecombination lines that arise from collisions between electrons and ions in\nthin plasma found in planetary nebulae and other astrophysical objects. One of\nthese targets contains 9 atomic terms while the other contains 26 terms. For\neach one of these targets, theoretical data concerning bound and autoionizing\nstates were generated in the intermediate coupling approximation by R-matrix\nand Autostructure codes and compared to experimental data. The comparison\nrevealed very good agreement. These theoretical data were then used to generate\nemissivity data and compare it to the carbon recombination lines found in the\nobservational line list of Zhang et al [2005] on the planetary nebula NGC 7027.\nThe main tool used in this analysis is the `Emissivity' code which is a program\ndeveloped by the author [2010] in the course of this investigation to calculate\nthe emissivity of transition lines from resonances and subsequent cascade\ndecay. The results of the analysis from both targets using a least-squares\noptimization technique indicate a temperature of 10200-10500K of the\nline-emitting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2010 15:32:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 21:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}
