We quantify this effect in\nthe case of a well-known cluster sample, HIFLUGCS. We simulate a population of\nX-ray clusters with various surface-brightness profiles, and use the\ninstrumental characteristics of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) to select\nflux-limited samples similar to the HIFLUGCS sample and predict the expected\nbias. For comparison, we also estimate observationally the bias in the HIFLUGCS\nsample using XMM-Newton and ROSAT data. We find that the selection of X-ray\ncluster samples is significantly biased ($\\sim29%$) in favor of the peaked,\nCool-Core (CC) objects, with respect to Non-Cool-Core (NCC) systems.\nInterestingly, we find that the bias affects the low-mass, nearby objects\n(groups, poor clusters) much more than the more luminous objects (i.e massive\nclusters). We also note a moderate increase of the bias for the more distant\nsystems. Observationally, we propose to select the objects according to their\nflux in a well-defined physical range excluding the cores,\n$0.2r_{500}-r_{500}$, to get rid of the bias. From the fluxes in this range, we\nreject 13 clusters out of the 64 in the HIFLUGCS sample, none of which appears\nto be NCC. As a result, we estimate that less than half (35-37%) of the galaxy\nclusters in the local Universe are strong CC.

We show that both unipartite and directed networks can be\nrepresented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely\nconsistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure\non which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the\nbipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA),\nwhich is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection.\nThe high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we\nmake. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a\nlocus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci\nmutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the\ncurrent population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment\ntechnique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from\nthe random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation\nrule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of\nthe MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process.\nExperimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms\nof modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 09:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 08:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 02:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) in South\nAfrica is a global hot spot of diversity and endemism, and provides a rich\nclass of species abundance data for such modeling. Here, we propose a\nmulti-stage Bayesian hierarchical model for explaining species abundance over\nthis region. Our model is specified at areal level, where the CFR is divided\ninto roughly $37{,}000$ one minute grid cells; species abundance is observed at\nsome locations within some cells. The abundance values are ordinally\ncategorized. Environmental and soil-type factors, likely to influence the\nabundance pattern, are included in the model. We formulate the empirical\nabundance pattern as a degraded version of the potential pattern, with the\ndegradation effect accomplished in two stages. First, we adjust for land use\ntransformation and then we adjust for measurement error, hence\nmisclassification error, to yield the observed abundance classifications. An\nimportant point in this analysis is that only $28%$ of the grid cells have been\nsampled and that, for sampled grid cells, the number of sampled locations\nranges from one to more than one hundred. Still, we are able to develop\npotential and transformed abundance surfaces over the entire region. In the\nhierarchical framework, categorical abundance classifications are induced by\ncontinuous latent surfaces. The degradation model above is built on the latent\nscale. On this scale, an areal level spatial regression model was used for\nmodeling the dependence of species abundance on the environmental factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 09:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 13:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

The multi-transition data of the various H2CO isotopologues, as well as\nfrom other molecules (e.g., CH3OH and N2D+) present in the observed bands, were\nanalysed using both the standard type rotation diagram analysis and, in\nselected cases, a more elaborate method of solving the radiative transfer for\noptically thick emission. In addition to molecular column densities, the\nanalysis also estimates the kinetic temperature and H2 density. Toward the SM1\ncore in rho Oph A, the H2CO deuterium fractionation is very high. In fact, the\nobserved D2CO/HDCO ratio is 1.34+/-0.19, while the HDCO/H2CO ratio is\n0.107+/-0.015. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the D2CO/HDCO\nabundance ratio is observed to be greater than 1. The kinetic temperature is in\nthe range 20-30 K in the cores of rho Oph A, and the H2 density is (6-10)x10^5\ncm-3. We estimate that the total H2 column density toward the deuterium peak is\n(1-4)x10^23 cm-2. As depleted gas-phase chemistry is not adequate, we suggest\nthat grain chemistry, possibly due to abstraction and exchange reactions along\nthe reaction chain H2CO -> HDCO -> D2CO, is at work to produce the very high\ndeuterium levels observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 10:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Recently, various authors have proposed joint modeling approaches for\nlongitudinal and time-to-event data for a single longitudinal variable.

In this paper we propose a regression calibration approach for\njointly modeling multiple longitudinal measurements and discrete time-to-event\ndata. Ideally, a two-stage modeling approach could be applied in which the\nmultiple longitudinal measurements are modeled in the first stage and the\nlongitudinal model is related to the time-to-event data in the second stage.\nBiased parameter estimation due to informative dropout makes this direct\ntwo-stage modeling approach problematic. We propose a regression calibration\napproach which appropriately accounts for informative dropout. We approximate\nthe conditional distribution of the multiple longitudinal measurements given\nthe event time by modeling all pairwise combinations of the longitudinal\nmeasurements using a bivariate linear mixed model which conditions on the event\ntime. Complete data are then simulated based on estimates from these pairwise\nconditional models, and regression calibration is used to estimate the\nrelationship between longitudinal data and time-to-event data using the\ncomplete data. We show that this approach performs well in estimating the\nrelationship between multivariate longitudinal measurements and the\ntime-to-event data and in estimating the parameters of the multiple\nlongitudinal process subject to informative dropout.

We show\nthat the unique fixed point, i.e. the unique potential generating a given\ndensity, is reached as the limiting point of an iterative procedure. The\none-to-one correspondence between densities and potentials is a straightforward\nresult provided that the response function of the divergence of the internal\nforces is bounded. The existence, i.e. the v-representability of a density, can\nbe proven as well provided that the operator norms of the response functions of\nthe members of the iterative sequence of potentials have an upper bound. The\ndensities under consideration have second time-derivatives that are required to\nsatisfy a condition slightly weaker than being square-integrable. This approach\navoids the usual restrictions of Taylor-expandability in time of the uniqueness\ntheorem by Runge and Gross [Phys.Rev.Lett.52, 997 (1984)] and of the existence\ntheorem by van Leeuwen [Phys.Rev.Lett. 82, 3863 (1999)].

Since then, sustaining development and advancement in\nelectronics and fabrication techniques has caused the devices to shrink in size\nand become smaller, paving the quest for increasing density and clock speed.\nThat quest has suddenly come to a halt due to fundamental bounds applied by\nphysical laws. But, demand for more and more computational power is still\nprevalent in the computing world. As a result, the microprocessor industry has\nstarted exploring the technology along a different dimension. Speed of a single\nwork unit (CPU) is no longer the concern, rather increasing the number of\nindependent processor cores packed in a single package has become the new\nconcern. Such processors are commonly known as multi-core processors. Scaling\nthe performance by using multiple cores has gained so much attention from the\nacademia and the industry, that not only desktops, but also laptops, PDAs, cell\nphones and even embedded devices today contain these processors. In this paper,\nwe explore state of the art technologies for multi-core processors and existing\nsoftware tools to support parallelism.

Four other stars GH Lup, l Car, T Mon and X Cyg\nshow tentative evidence for extended infrared emission.

This has been\nfollowed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant\nexpansion of the size of the population, that began when our own particular\n`sapiens' species emerged, just a few hundred thousand years ago. The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years. It is shown here how the value of this hitherto\nmysterious timescale governing the memetic phase is explicable in terms of what\nhappenned in the preceding genetic phase. The outcome is that the order of\nmagnitude of the Foerster timescale can be accounted for as the product of the\nrelevant (human) generation timescale, about 20 years, with the number of bits\nof information in the genome, of the order of ten thousand million. Whereas the\norigin of our `homo' genus may well have involved an evolutionary hard step, it\ntranspires that the emergence of our particular `sapiens' species was rather an\nautomatic process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 14:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 16:31:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2011 10:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Variable emission and absorption\ncomponents detected in H\\alpha line profiles show the dynamic nature of\ninteraction between V351 Ori and its circumstellar environment. The H\\alpha\nnon-photospheric profiles of the star most probably originate in the disk wind.\nEpisodic accretion of gaseous material at a slow rate and outflow of clumpy\ngaseous material are still occurring in V351 Ori at an age of ~6.5 Myr. Dynamic\nmagnetospheric accretion and disk wind emerge as the most satisfactory model\nfor interpreting the observed line profile variations of V351 Ori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 15:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-11"}

We demonstrate that the index\nsaturation value depends on the plasma temperature of converging flow. We\nself-consistently calculate the Compton cloud (CC) plasma temperature as a\nfunction of mass accretion rate using the energy balance between energy\ndissipation and Compton cooling. We explain the observable phenomenon, index-\nmdot correlations using a Monte-Carlo simulation of radiative processes in the\ninnermost part (CC) of a BH source and we account for the Comptonization\nprocesses in the presence of thermal and bulk motions, as basic types of plasma\nmotion. We show that, when mdot increases, BH sources evolve to high and very\nsoft states (HSS and VSS, respectively), in which the strong blackbody-like and\nsteep power-law components are formed in the resulting X-ray spectrum. The\nsimultaneous detections of these two components strongly depends on sensitivity\nof high energy instruments, given that the relative contribution of the hard\npower-law tail in the resulting VSS spectrum can be very low, which is why, to\ndate {\\it RXTE} observations of the VSS X-ray spectrum has been characterized\nby the presence of the strong BB-like component only.

Instead of a best rank-$R$\napproximation the best fitting Generalized Schur Decomposition (GSD) is\ncomputed. Under the restriction of nonsingular upper triangular matrices in the\nGSD, the set of GSD solutions equals the interior and boundary of the rank-$R$\nset. Here, we show that this holds even without the restriction. We provide a\ncomplete classification of interior, boundary, and exterior points of the\nrank-$R$ set of real $I\\times J\\times 2$ arrays, and show that the set of GSD\nsolutions equals the interior and boundary of this set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 15:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

The set-up\nof Gaussian graphical models is used to construct representations of the\nco-expression network in such a way that redundancy and the propagation of\nspurious information along the network are avoided. The proposed inference\nprocedure is based on the minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion\n(BIC) in the class of decomposable graphical models. This class of models can\nbe used to represent complex relationships and has suitable properties that\nallow to make effective inference in problems with high degree of complexity\n(e.g. several thousands of genes) and small number of observations (e.g.\n10-100) as typically occurs in high throughput gene expression studies. Taking\nadvantage of the internal structure of decomposable graphical models, we\nconstruct a compact representation of the co-expression network that allows to\nidentify the regions with high concentration of differentially expressed genes.\nIt is argued that differentially expressed genes located in highly\ninterconnected regions of the co-expression network are less informative than\ndifferentially expressed genes located in less interconnected regions. Based on\nthat idea, a measure of uncertainty that resembles the notion of relative\nentropy is proposed. Our methods are illustrated with three publically\navailable data sets on microarray experiments (the larger involving more than\n50,000 genes and 64 patients) and a short simulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 13:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-17"}
