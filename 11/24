Thereby a quasi-quartet ground state observed in CeNi9Ge4\nreduces to a two-fold degenerate one in CeNi8CuGe4. This leads to a\nmodiffcation of the effective spin degeneracy of the Kondo lattice ground state\nand to the appearance of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. To obtain a better\nunderstanding of consequences resulting from a reduction of the effective spin\ndegeneracy, we stepwise replaced Ni by Co. Thereby an increase of the Kondo and\nRKKY interactions through the reduction of the effective d-electron count is\nexpected. Accordingly, a paramagnetic Fermi liquid ground state should arise.\nOur experimental studies, however, reveal AFM order already for small Co\nconcentrations, which becomes even more pronounced with increasing Co content\nx.

We will show that electrons in the atomic\nshells are stripped during the acceleration process, when the atoms already\nmove relativistically. For typical environment around SNRs the dominant\nionization process is the photo-ionization due to the background galactic\nradiation. The ionization has two interesting consequences. First, because the\ntotal photo-ionization time is comparable to the beginning of the Sedov-Taylor\nphase, the maximum energy which ions can achieve is smaller than the standard\nresult of the DSA, which predict $E_{\\max}\\propto Z_N$. As a consequence the\nstructure of the CR spectrum in the {\\it knee} region can be affected.

The model predicts the BH mass, spin and mass accretion\nhistory. BH mass grows via accretion triggered by discs becoming dynamically\nunstable or galaxy mergers (called the starburst mode) and accretion from\nquasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes (called the hot-halo mode). By taking into\naccount AGN obscuration, we obtain a very good fit to the observed luminosity\nfunctions (LF) of AGN (optical, soft and hard X-ray, and bolometric) for a wide\nrange of redshifts (0<z<6). The model predicts a hierarchical build up of BH\nmass, with the typical mass of actively growing BHs increasing with decreasing\nredshift. Remarkably, despite this, we find downsizing in the AGN population,\nin terms of the differential growth with redshift of the space density of faint\nand bright AGN. This arises naturally from the interplay between the starburst\nand hot-halo accretion modes. The faint end of the LF is dominated by massive\nBHs experiencing quiescent accretion via a thick disc, primarily during the\nhot-halo mode. The bright end of the LF, on the other hand, is dominated by AGN\nwhich host BHs accreting close to or in excess of the Eddington limit during\nthe starburst mode. The model predicts that the comoving space density of AGN\npeaks at z~3, similar to the star formation history. However, when taking into\naccount obscuration, the space density of faint AGN peaks at lower redshift\n(z<2) than that of bright AGN (z~2-3). This implies that the cosmic evolution\nof AGN is shaped in part by obscuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

One major challenge for TFETs so far has been achieving high drive\ncurrents, which is a prerequisite for high-performance operation. In this paper\nwe explore the performance potential of a 1D TFET with a broken-gap\nheterojunction source injector using dissipative quantum transport simulations\nbased on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, and the carbon nanotube\nbandstructure as the model 1D material system.

The 1D geometry is recognized to be\nuniquely favorable due to its superior electrostatic control, reduced carrier\nthermalization rate, and beneficial quantum confinement effects that reduce the\noff-state leakage below the thermionic limit. Because of higher source\ninjection compared to staggered-gap and homojunction geometries, BG-TFET\ndelivers superior performance that is comparable to MOSFET's. BG-TFET even\nexceeds the MOSFET performance at lower supply voltages (VDD), showing promise\nfor low-power/high-performance applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 21:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-25"}

All protocols\nhave polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the\nprotocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first\nprotocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to\ncompute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that\nregardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned\nthrough the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation.\nUnfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in\nwhich case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the\ntally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the\ncommunication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and\nauthorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is\nalso limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single\nauthority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt\nauthority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final\nprotocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification\ntechnique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting\nthe protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding\nversions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 21:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-25"}

Such features are usually interpreted as due\neither to kinematics, such as biconical outflows and/or disk rotation of the\nnarrow line region (NLR) around single black holes, or to the relative motion\nof two distinct NLRs in a merging pair of AGNs. Here we report follow-up near\ninfrared (NIR) imaging and optical slit spectroscopy of 31 double-peaked [OIII]\ntype 2 AGNs drawn from the SDSS parent sample presented in Liu et al (2010).\nThese data reveal a mixture of origins for the double-peaked feature. Roughly\n10% of our objects are best explained by binary AGNs at (projected) kpc-scale\nseparations, where two stellar components with spatially coincident NLRs are\nseen. ~ 50% of our objects have [OIII] emission offset by a few kpc,\ncorresponding to the two velocity components seen in the SDSS spectra, but\nthere are no corresponding double stellar components seen in the NIR imaging.\nFor those objects with sufficiently high quality slit spectra, we see velocity\nand/or velocity dispersion gradients in [OIII] emission, suggestive of the\nkinematic signatures of a single NLR. The remaining ~40% of our objects are\nambiguous, and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguish\nbetween the two scenarios. Our observations therefore favor the kinematics\nscenario with a single AGN for the majority of these double-peaked [OIII] type\n2 AGNs. We emphasize the importance of combining imaging and slit spectroscopy\nin identifying kpc binary AGNs, i.e., in no cases does one of these alone allow\nan unambiguous identification.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20. These unexpected\nspectral changes do not correlate with the measured flux variations above\n0.3GeV. In this paper, we also present the first results from the\n4.5-month-long multifrequency campaign (2009 March 15 - August 1) on Mrk 501,\nwhich included the VLBA, Swift, RXTE, MAGIC and VERITAS, the F-GAMMA,\nGASP-WEBT, and other collaborations and instruments which provided excellent\ntemporal and energy coverage of the source throughout the entire campaign. The\naverage spectral energy distribution of Mrk 501 is well described by the\nstandard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. In the framework of this\nmodel, we find that the dominant emission region is characterized by a size <~\n0.1 pc (comparable within a factor of few to the size of the partially-resolved\nVLBA core at 15-43 GHz), and that the total jet power (~10^{44} erg s^{-1})\nconstitutes only a small fraction (~10^{-3}) of the Eddington luminosity. The\nenergy distribution of the freshly-accelerated radiating electrons required to\nfit the time-averaged data has a broken power-law form in the energy range\n0.3GeV-10TeV, with spectral indices 2.2 and 2.7 below and above the break\nenergy of 20GeV. We argue that such a form is consistent with a scenario in\nwhich the bulk of the energy dissipation within the dominant emission zone of\nMrk 501 is due to relativistic, proton-mediated shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 23:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Here\nthis class of processes is analyzed with minimal model assumptions by\nconsidering all possible combinations of spin 0, 1/2 or 1, and of weak\niso-singlets, -doublets or -triplets for the new particles. Adding to existing\nwork on mass and spin measurements, two new variables for spin determination\nand an asymmetry for the determination of the couplings of the new particles\nare introduced. It is shown that these observables allow one to independently\ndetermine the spin and the couplings of the new particles, except for a few\ncases that turn out to be indistinguishable at the LHC.

Here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of the\nz_abs=2.58 DLA on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar SDSS\nJ091826.16+163609.0. The galaxy counterpart of the DLA is detected in the OIII\n5007 and OII 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the NIR at an impact\nparameter of 16 kpc. Ly-alpha emission is not detected. The upper limit implies\nthat Ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order of\nmagnitude. The DLA is amongst the most metal-rich DLAs studied so far at\ncomparable redshifts. We find evidence for substantial depletion of refractory\nelements onto dust grains. Fitting the main metal line component of the DLA,\nwhich is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the total\ncolumn density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances from\nZnII, SII, SiII, CrII, MnII, FeII and NiII of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88,\n-0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively.

The background quasar Q0918+1636 is amongst the\nreddest QSOs at redshifts 3.02<z<3.12 from the SDSS catalogue. Its UV to NIR\nspectrum is well fitted by a composite QSO spectrum reddened by SMC/LMC-like\nextinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction given\nby A_V = 0.2 mag. This supports previous claims that there may be more\nmetal-rich DLAs missing from current samples due to dust reddening of the\nbackground QSOs.

For an\naccretion rate that corresponds to the inferred jet power, and to a fit of the\nobserved SED by an ADAF model, the density of injected pairs is found to be\nsmaller than the Goldreich-Julian density by a factor of a few.

The estimated gap width is not smaller than $0.01 r_s$ if\nthe density of seed charges is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The VHE power\nradiated by the gap can easily account for the luminosity of the TeV source\ndetected by H.E.S.S.

About 32 days later, a\nsteady decline in count-rate set in. NLTE model atmosphere spectral fits during\nthe super-soft phase show that the effective temperature of the white dwarf\nincreases from ~65 eV to ~90 eV during the extreme variability phase, falling\nslowly after about day 60 and more rapidly after day 80. The bolometric\nluminosity is seen to be approximately constant and close to Eddington from day\n45 up to day 60, the subsequent decline possibly signalling the end of\nextensive nuclear burning. Before the decline, a multiply-periodic, ~35 s\nmodulation of the soft X-rays was present and may be the signature of a nuclear\nfusion driven instability.

In this case, if the temperature decreases\noutward, the flow may be subject to a buoyancy instability (the magnetothermal\ninstability, or MTI). The MTI amplifies the magnetic field, and aligns field\nlines with the radial direction. If the accretion flow is differentially\nrotating, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may also be present. Using\ntwo-dimensional, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate\nthe interaction between these two instabilities. We use global simulations that\nspan over two orders of magnitude in radius, centered on the region around the\nBondi radius where the infall time of gas is longer than the growth time of\nboth the MTI and MRI. Significant amplification of the magnetic field is\nproduced by both instabilities, although we find that the MTI primarily\namplifies the radial component, and the MRI primarily the toroidal component,\nof the field, respectively. Most importantly, we find that if the MTI can\namplify the magnetic energy by a factor $F_t$, and the MRI by a factor $F_r$,\nthen when the MTI and MRI are both present, the magnetic energy can be\namplified by a factor of $F_t \\cdot F_r$. We therefore conclude that\namplification of the magnetic energy by the MTI and MRI operates independently.\nWe also find that the MTI contributes to the transport of angular momentum,\nbecause radial motions induced by the MTI increase the Maxwell (by amplifying\nthe magnetic field) and Reynolds stresses. Finally, we find that thermal\nconduction decreases the slope of the radial temperature profile. The increased\ntemperature near the Bondi radius decreases the mass accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 10:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 07:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

To this end\nTononi et al. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 5033 (1994)] proposed a measure of\nneural complexity that purports to capture this property based on mutual\ninformation between complementary subsets of a system. Neural complexity, so\ndefined, is one of a family of information theoretic metrics developed to\nmeasure the balance between the segregation and integration of a system's\ndynamics. One key question arising for such measures involves understanding how\nthey are influenced by network topology. Sporns et al. [Cereb. Cortex 10, 127\n(2000)] employed numerical models in order to determine the dependence of\nneural complexity on the topological features of a network. However, a complete\npicture has yet to be established. While De Lucia et al. [Phys. Rev. E 71,\n016114 (2005)] made the first attempts at an analytical account of this\nrelationship, their work utilized a formulation of neural complexity that, we\nargue, did not reflect the intuitions of the original work. In this paper we\nstart by describing weighted connection matrices formed by applying a random\ncontinuous weight distribution to binary adjacency matrices. This allows us to\nderive an approximation for neural complexity in terms of the moments of the\nweight distribution and elementary graph motifs. In particular we explicitly\nestablish a dependency of neural complexity on cyclic graph motifs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 10:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 12:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

We present a\nseries of new models based on the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model, which\nis a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in financial\nmarkets. Our new models identify the fundamental value of an asset price and\ncrash nonlinearity from a bubble calibration. In addition to forecasting the\ntime of the end of a bubble, the new models can also estimate the fundamental\nvalue and the crash nonlinearity. Besides, the crash nonlinearity obtained in\nthe new models presents a new approach to possibly identify the dynamics of a\ncrash after a bubble. We test the models using data from three historical\nbubbles ending in crashes from different markets. They are: the Hong Kong Hang\nSeng index 1997 crash, the S&P 500 index 1987 crash and the Shanghai Composite\nindex 2009 crash. All results suggest that the new models perform very well in\ndescribing bubbles, forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamental\nvalue and the crash nonlinearity. The performance of the new models is tested\nunder both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian residual assumption. Under the\nGaussian residual assumption, nested hypotheses with the Wilks statistics are\nused and the p-values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary.\nUnder non-Gaussian residual assumption, we use a bootstrap method to get type I\nand II errors of the hypotheses.

Although accretion of gaseous water could not be the only possible\norigin of the observed icy mantles covering dust grains in cold molecular\nclouds, it is well known that water accreted from the gas phase on surfaces\nkept at 10 K forms ice films that exhibit a very high porosity. It is also\nknown that in the dark clouds H2 formation occurs on the icy surface of dust\ngrains and that part of the energy (4.48 eV) released when adsorbed atoms react\nto form H2 is deposited in the ice. The experimental study described in the\npresent work focuses on how relevant changes of the ice morphology result from\natomic hydrogen exposure and subsequent recombination. Using the\ntemperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique and a method of inversion\nanalysis of TPD spectra, we show that there is an exponential decrease in the\nporosity of the amorphous water ice sample following D-atom irradiation. This\ndecrease is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ice and has a value\nof Phi_0 = 2 x 10^16 D-atoms/cm^2 per layer of H2O. We also use a model which\nconfirms that the binding sites on the porous ice are destroyed regardless of\ntheir energy depth, and that the reduction of the porosity corresponds in fact\nto a reduction of the effective area. This reduction appears to be compatible\nwith the fraction of D2 formation energy transferred to the porous ice network.\nUnder interstellar conditions, this effect is likely to be efficient and,\ntogether with other compaction processes, provides a good argument to believe\nthat interstellar ice is amorphous and non-porous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 11:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 22:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

In this paper we deal with the\nproblem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by\nmeans of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color\nof the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the\nfact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a\ndistributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has\nbeen growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and\nsensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the\nassignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring.\n  The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of\nJapanese tree frogs. Male frogs use their calls to attract females.\nInterestingly, groups of males that are located nearby each other desynchronize\ntheir calls. This is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize\nthe male frogs when their calls are not too close in time.

The method works as follows: we start\nwith any initial magnetostatic global field configuration (e.g. zero, dipole),\nand along the boundary surface we create an evolving distribution of tangential\n(horizontal) electric fields that, via Faraday's equation, give rise to a\nrespective normal field distribution approaching asymptotically the target\ndistribution.

In a classical congestion game, multiple users share the\nsame set of resources and a user's payoff for using any resource is a function\nof the total number of users sharing it. As a potential game, this game enjoys\nsome very appealing properties, including the existence of a pure strategy Nash\nequilibrium (NE) and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a\nNE (also called the finite improvement property or FIP). While it's tempting to\nuse this model to study spectrum sharing, it does not capture the spatial reuse\nfeature of wireless communication, where resources (interpreted as channels)\nmay be reused without increasing congestion provided that users are located far\naway from each other. This motivates us to study an extended form of the\ncongestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the\nnumber of its interfering users sharing it. This naturally results in a spatial\ncongestion game (SCG), where users are placed over a network (or a conflict\ngraph). We study fundamental properties of a spatial congestion game; in\nparticular, we seek to answer under what conditions this game possesses the\nfinite improvement property or a Nash equilibrium. We also discuss the\nimplications of these results when applied to wireless spectrum sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 14:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

By symmetry, I mean that\ndifferent ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and\nlose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame\nthese explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a\nrecently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the\nnatural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear:\nthe information in observations at small population sizes scales\nlogarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information\ngrades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a\ngamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed\npatterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the\nmagnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear.\nThis measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of allelic\ndiversity in population genetics and to a wide variety of other patterns in\nbiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 15:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-28"}

Can we expect that the\nrepresentation found by such a dictionary for a previously unseen example from\nthe same source will have L_2 error of the same magnitude as those for the\ngiven examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and\nstudy this questions from a statistical learning theory perspective.\n  We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for\ntwo types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the\nexpected L_2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case\nof l_1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of\nthe order of O(sqrt(np log(m lambda)/m)), where n is the dimension, p is the\nnumber of elements in the dictionary, lambda is a bound on the l_1 norm of the\ncoefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing\nresults.

For this purpose, we\nhave developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study\nthe formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and\nsedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K,\nFreytag et al. 2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving\nmechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rule\nfor the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and Teff , which is relatively\ninsensitive to gravity. This rule has been used in the construction of the new\nmodel atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the\ndiffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of\ndepth. This new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra has\nbeencomputedfor100,000K>Teff >400K,5.5>logg>-0.5,and[M/H]=+0.5to -1.5, and the\nreference solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). We found that the new\nsolar abundances allow an improved (close to perfect) reproduction of the\nphoto- metric and spectroscopic VLMs properties, and, for the first time, a\nsmooth transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike the\ntransition between the NextGen models from Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b, and the\nAMES-Dusty models from Allard et al. 2001). In the BDs regime, the BT-Settl\nmodels propose an improved explanation for the M-L-T spectral transition. In\nthis paper, we therefore present the new BT-Settl model atmosphere grid, which\nexplains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary mass regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 15:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-25"}

New proper motion measurements of\nH$_2$ features show that within the errors of measurement, the outflow\noriginated from the site of stellar ejection.

It is proposed that the\ngravitational potential energy released by the formation of a short-period\nbinary, most likely source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered the\noutflow. A scenario is presented for the formation of a compact,\nnon-hierarchical multiple star system, its decay into an ejected binary and two\nhigh-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. Three mechanisms may have\ncontributed to the explosion in the gas: (i) Unbinding of the circum-cluster\nenvelope following stellar ejection, (ii) disruption of circumstellar disks and\nhigh-speed expulsion of the resulting debris during the final stellar\nencounter, and (iii) the release of stored magnetic energy. Plausible\nproto-stellar disk end envelope properties can produce the observed outflow\nmass, velocity, and kinetic energy distributions.
