We formally solve for the\nenergy of the external magnetic field and check that it decreases monotonously\nalong the entire rotation. We also describe the instability using perturbation\ntheory, and see that it happens due to the work done by the interaction of the\nmagnetic field with surface currents. Finally, we consider the stabilising\neffect of adding a toroidal field by studying the potential energy perturbation\nwhen the rotation is not done along a sharp cut, but with a continuous\ndisplacement field that switches the direction of rotation across a region of\nsmall but finite width.

Expressions are given for the modal expansion\ncoefficients, and in the low-loss case it is shown that the coefficient values\ndepend only on the difference in reciprocal frequency space of the operating\nfrequency from the resonant frequency of each mode.

In a such setup, it would be unwise, for\nestimating f, to use a conditional approach based upon the probability\ndistribution function of Y given X. Indeed, this approach is affected by the\ncurse of dimensionality, so that the resulting estimator of the residual term E\nwould have considerably a slow rate of convergence if the dimension of X is\nvery high. Two approaches are proposed in this thesis to avoid the curse of\ndimensionality.

Imposing the invariance under axion-shifts, all\nsuch corrections (but the imaginary constant one) can be introduced or removed\nthrough suitable, lower unitriangular symplectic transformations, dubbed\nPeccei-Quinn (PQ) transformations. Since PQ transformations do not belong to\nthe d=4 U-duality group G4, in symmetric cases they generally have a\nnon-trivial action on the unique quartic invariant polynomial I4 of the charge\nrepresentation R of G4. This leads to interesting phenomena in relation to\ntheory of extremal black hole attractors; namely, the possibility to make\ntransitions between different charge orbits of R, with corresponding change of\nthe supersymmetry properties of the supported attractor solutions. Furthermore,\na suitable action of PQ transformations can also set I4 to zero, or vice versa\nit can generate a non-vanishing I4: this corresponds to transitions between\n\"large\" and \"small\" charge orbits, which we classify in some detail within the\n\"special coordinates\" symplectic frame.

Regardless of the authentication method\nused, CEDAR establishes a secure session key, which has the flexibility to be\nused for multiple capabilities. We demonstrate how a layered approach to\nsecurity sessions can avoid round-trips and latency inherent in network\nauthentication. The creation of a distinct session management layer allows for\noptimizations to improve scalability by way of delegating sessions to other\ncomponents in the system. This session delegation creates a chain of trust that\nreduces the overhead of establishing secure connections and enables centralized\nenforcement of system-wide security policies.

We assume a modified black-body SED with dust emissivity parameter\nbeta (F ~ lambda^(-beta)) and a single dust temperature T_d, and find that the\ndust temperature and emissivity index varies over the science demonstration\nfield as 10< T_rm < 25 K and 1 < beta< 4.

To overcome this challenge, we use statistical tools\nto analyze the Chandra X-ray images of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud\nSNRs. We apply two techniques, a power-ratio method (a multipole expansion) and\nwavelet-transform analysis, to measure the global and local morphological\nproperties of the X-ray line and thermal emission in twenty-four SNRs. We find\nthat Type Ia SNRs have statistically more spherical and mirror symmetric\nthermal X-ray emission than core-collapse (CC) SNRs. The ability to type SNRs\nbased on thermal emission morphology alone enables, for the first time, the\ntyping of SNRs with weak X-ray lines or with low-resolution spectra. We\nidentify one source, SNR G344.7-0.1, as originating from a CC explosion that\nwas previously unknown, and we confirm the tentative Type Ia classifications of\nG337.2-0.7 and G272.2-3.2. Although the global morphology is indicative of the\nexplosion type, the relative morphology of the X-ray line emission within SNRs\nis not: all sources in our sample have well-mixed ejecta, irrespective of\nstellar origin. In particular, we find that 90% of the bright metal-line\nemitting substructures are spatially coincident and have similar scales, even\nif the metals arise from different burning processes. Moreover, the overall\nX-ray line morphologies within each SNR are the same, with <6% differences.\nThese findings reinforce that hydrodynamical instabilities can efficiently mix\nejecta in Type Ia and CC SNRs. The only exception is W49B, which is likely from\nits jet-driven/bipolar SN explosion. Finally, we describe observational\nconstraints that can be used to test hydrodynamical models of SNR evolution;\nnotably, the filling factor of X-ray emission decreases with SNR age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nstrong dependence of R_MgII on M_star is most naturally explained, if more\nmassive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed MgII\nabsorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formation\nin the galaxies. The additional scaling relation of R_MgII with sSFR can be\nunderstood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburst\noutflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos.\nThe latter is motivated by the well-known sSFR--M_star} inverse correlation in\nfield galaxies.

While\nGeneral Relativity predicts just two polarizations of gravitational waves, the\nso-called plus and cross polarizations, numerous alternative theories of\ngravity predict up to six different polarizations which will potentially be\nobserved in current and future generations of gravitational wave detectors.\nBekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) theory and its generalization fall\ninto one such class of theory that predict the full gamut of six polarizations\nof gravitational waves. In this paper we begin the study of quasinormal modes\n(QNMs) in TeVeS by studying perturbations of the scalar field in a spherically\nsymmetric background. We show that, at least in the case where superluminal\npropagation of perturbations is not present, black holes are generically stable\nto this kind of perturbation. We also make a unique prediction that, as the\nlimit of the various coupling parameters of the theory tend to zero, the QNM\nspectrum tends to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ times the QNM spectrum induced by scalar\nperturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole in General Relativity due to the\nintrinsic presence of the background vector field. We further show that the QNM\nspectrum does not vary significantly from this value for small values of the\ntheory's coupling parameters, however can vary by as much as a few percent for\nlarger, but still physically relevant parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 20:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 03:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-02"}

Non-Newtonian fluids show very complex time\nand strain dependent behavior and may have initial yield stress. Their common\nfeature is that they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of\nproportionality between stress and rate of deformation. They are generally\nclassified into three main categories: time-independent, time-dependent and\nviscoelastic. Two three-dimensional networks representing a sand pack and Berea\nsandstone were used. An iterative numerical technique is used to solve the\npressure field and obtain the flow rate and apparent viscosity. The\ntime-independent category is investigated using two fluid models: Ellis and\nHerschel-Bulkley. The analysis confirmed the reliability of the non-Newtonian\nnetwork model used in this study. Good results are obtained, especially for the\nEllis model, when comparing the network model results to experimental data sets\nfound in the literature. The yield-stress phenomenon is also investigated and\nseveral numerical algorithms were developed and implemented to predict\nthreshold yield pressure of the network. An extensive literature survey and\ninvestigation were carried out to understand the phenomenon of viscoelasticity\nwith special attention to the flow in porous media. The extensional flow and\nviscosity and converging-diverging geometry were thoroughly examined as the\nbasis of the peculiar viscoelastic behavior in porous media. The modified\nBautista-Manero model was identified as a promising candidate for modeling the\nflow of viscoelastic materials which also show thixotropic attributes. An\nalgorithm that employs this model was implemented in the non-Newtonian code and\nthe initial results were analyzed.

The aim is to determine the location and character of its\nknown variable radio emission. The radio emission consists of a primary\ncomponent associated with the binary, and a non-thermal source (NE), $0.8\" to\nthe NE. This work reveals that NE shows no evidence of variation demonstrating\nthat the variable emission arises in the primary component. With NE constant,\nthe radio flux from the primary can now be well determined for the first time,\nespecially in observations that do not resolve both the primary and NE\ncomponents. The variable radio emission from the primary has a period of\n6.7+/-0.3 years which is described by a simple model of a non-thermal source\norbiting within the stellar wind envelope of the binary. Such a model implies\nthe presence of a third, unresolved stellar companion (Star C) orbiting the\n6.6-day binary with a period of 6.7 years.

Most of the work on this problem,\nthough extensive, has been limited to homogeneous networks, in which agents\nhave identical masses and control gains, and symmetric control, in which\ninformation from front and back neighbors are weighted equally. We examine the\neffect of heterogeneity and asymmetry on the closed loop stability margin,\nwhich is measured by the real part of the least stable pole of the closed-loop\nsystem. By using a PDE (partial differential equation) approximation in the\nlimit of large number of vehicles, we show that heterogeneity has little effect\nwhile asymmetry has a significant effect on the stability margin. When control\nis symmetric, the stability margin decays to 0 as $O(1/N^2)$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of agents, even when the agents are heterogeneous in their masses and\ncontrol gains. In contrast, we show that arbitrarily small amount of asymmetry\nin the velocity feedback gains can improve the decay of the stability margin to\n$O(1/N)$. Poor design of such asymmetry makes the closed loop unstable for\nsufficiently large $N$. With equal amount of asymmetry in both position and\nvelocity feedback gains, the closed loop is stable for arbitrary $N$ and the\nstability margin scaling trend can also be improved to $O(1/N)$, but the\nsensitivity to disturbance becomes worse.

However, because of\ncomplexity of sunspot regions local helioseismology diagnostics require careful\nanalysis of systematic uncertainties and physical interpretation of the\ninversion results. We present new results of comparison of the ring-diagram\nanalysis and time-distance helioseismology for active region NOAA 9787, for\nwhich a previous comparison showed significant differences in the subsurface\nsound-speed structure, and discuss systematic uncertainties of the measurements\nand inversions. Our results show that both the ring-diagram and time-distance\ntechniques give qualitatively similar results, revealing a characteristic\ntwo-layer seismic sound-speed structure consistent with the results for other\nactive regions. However, a quantitative comparison of the inversion results is\nnot straightforward. It must take into account differences in the sensitivity,\nspatial resolution and the averaging kernels. In particular, because of the\nacoustic power suppression, the contribution of the sunspot seismic structure\nto the ring-diagram signal can be substantially reduced. We show that taking\ninto account this effect reduces the difference in the depth of transition\nbetween the negative and positive sound-speed variations inferred by these\nmethods. Further detailed analysis of the sensitivity, resolution and averaging\nproperties of the local helioseismology methods is necessary for consolidation\nof the inversion results. It seems to be important that both methods indicate\nthat the seismic structure of sunspots is rather deep and extends to at least\n20 Mm below the surface, putting constraints on theoretical models of sunspots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 05:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be\nselected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a\nprocess of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by\nmost evolutionary biologists today. Results: I do, however, contend that, if so\nmuch speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be\nconditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other\nwords, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce\npreferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding with the rest of\nthe ancestral population. This leads me to propose a model whereby new species\narise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small\ninbreeding groups \"budding\" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by\nseveral advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive\nphenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding.\nReproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of\ndivergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the\ndirect selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of\nspeciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more\nspeciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many\nrecessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation,\nwith these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited\ngenomic diversity. Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to\ngains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of\nspeciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the\nadvantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often\ncorrespond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of\ninbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in\ngenomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species\nwould correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and\noutbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive\noutbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that\ncould ultimately only lead to extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 08:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 13:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2011 06:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 13:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

At a given value of $M_*$, our\nsample consists primarily of galaxies that are more HI-rich than average. We\nconstructed a series of three control samples for comparison with these HI-rich\ngalaxies. As expected, HI-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of same\nstellar mass that are selected without regard to HI content. The majority of\nthese differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas are\nbluer and more actively star-forming. In order to identify those galaxy\nproperties that are causally connected with HI content, we compare results\nderived for the HI sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellar\nmass, size and NUV-$r$ colour. The only photometric property that is clearly\nattributable to increasing HI content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy.\nGalaxies with larger HI fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outer\ndisks compared to the inner part of the galaxy.

The main\nconclusion from this analysis is that for the large majority of LINERs (84%) an\nunresolved nuclear source has been identified as well as extended emission with\nequivalent sizes ranging from few tens till about hundredths of parsecs. Their\nmorphologies appear not to be homogeneous being basically grouped into three\nclasses:nuclear outflow candidates (42%), core-halo morphologies (25%) and\nnuclear spiral disks (14%). Clumpy structures reminiscent of young stellar\nclusters are not a common property on LINERs. The remaining 5 galaxies are too\ndusty to allow a clear view of the ionized gas distribution. A size-luminosity\nrelation has been found between the equivalent radius of the Halpha emission\nand the (2-10 keV) X-ray luminosities. Both ionised gas morphologies and the\nsize-luminosity relation are indistinguishable from those of low luminosity\nSeyferts, suggesting the same origin for the NLR of LINERs and Seyferts. Also a\nrelation between soft X-rays and ionized gas has been suggested for the first\ntime in LINERs. From multiwavelength data, only 4 out of the 32 LINERs have no\nevidences on an AGN nature of theirnuclear sources from multiwavelength data,\nbut extremely obscured AGNs cannot be discarded out given the Compton thick\nsignatures of their X-ray emission. For the confirmed AGN LINERs, their Halpha\nimaging favour core-halo and outflow morphologies (65% of the cases). Finally,\ntheir calculated Eddington ratios show that our LINER sources radiate at\nsub-Eddington regime, with core-halo systems having on average larger Eddington\nratios than outflow candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 12:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This quantity, in case of no extra degrees of\nfreedom, depends upon the chemical potential and the temperature characterizing\nthe three active neutrino distributions, as well as by their possible\nnon-thermal features. In the present analysis we determine the upper bounds\nthat BBN places on N_eff from primordial neutrino--antineutrino asymmetries,\nwith a careful treatment of the dynamics of neutrino oscillations. We consider\nquite a wide range for the total lepton number in the neutrino sector, eta_nu=\neta_{nu_e}+eta_{nu_mu}+eta_{nu_tau} and the initial electron neutrino asymmetry\neta_{nu_e}^in, solving the corresponding kinetic equations which rule the\ndynamics of neutrino (antineutrino) distributions in phase space due to\ncollisions, pair processes and flavor oscillations. New bounds on both the\ntotal lepton number in the neutrino sector and the nu_e -bar{nu}_e asymmetry at\nthe onset of BBN are obtained fully exploiting the time evolution of neutrino\ndistributions, as well as the most recent determinations of primordial 2H/H\ndensity ratio and 4He mass fraction. Note that taking the baryon fraction as\nmeasured by WMAP, the 2H/H abundance plays a relevant role in constraining the\nallowed regions in the eta_nu -eta_{nu_e}^in plane. These bounds fix the\nmaximum contribution of neutrinos with primordial asymmetries to N_eff as a\nfunction of the mixing parameter theta_13, and point out the upper bound N_eff\n< 3.4. Comparing these results with the forthcoming measurement of N_eff by the\nPlanck satellite will likely provide insight on the nature of the radiation\ncontent of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 15:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 11:55:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The HI\nshell has no obvious continuum counterpart in the CGPS radio images at 408 and\n1420 MHz or in the IRAS images. We found no evidence for early-type massive\nstars, most likely as a result of the large extinction that is expected for\nthis large distance. An analysis of the energetics and of the main physical\nparameters of the HI shell shows that this shell is likely the result of the\ncombined action of the stellar winds and supernova explosions of many stars.
