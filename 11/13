The network was constructed as a 2-dimensional\nWatts-Strogatz model (500x500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), and\nthe dynamics involved rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic\nspread. The model of the epidemic is SIR with latency time of 3 time steps. The\nbehaviour of the epidemic was checked over the range of shortcut probability\nper underlying bond 0-0.5. The quantity of interest was percolation threshold\nfor the epidemic spread, for which numerical results were checked against an\napproximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation\nthresholds for the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result\nshows that the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static\nsmall world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7 +/- 1.4%, while the\noverall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the\nanalytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static\nsmall-world we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on\nnetwork size in comparison with finite-size scaling known for regular lattice.\nWe also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to\nlatency time of the disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 16:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-28"}

A common approach for characterizing the syntax of these\ncomplex syllable sequences is to use transition probabilities between the\nsyllables. This is equivalent to the Markov model, in which each syllable is\nassociated with one state, and the transition probabilities between the states\ndo not depend on the state transition history. Here we analyze the song syntax\nin a Bengalese finch. We show that the Markov model fails to capture the\nstatistical properties of the syllable sequences. Instead, a state transition\nmodel that accurately describes the statistics of the syllable sequences\nincludes adaptation of the self-transition probabilities when states are\nrepeatedly revisited, and allows associations of more than one state to the\nsame syllable. Such a model does not increase the model complexity\nsignificantly. Mathematically, the model is a partially observable Markov model\nwith adaptation (POMMA). The success of the POMMA supports the branching chain\nnetwork hypothesis of how syntax is controlled within the premotor song nucleus\nHVC, and suggests that adaptation and many-to-one mapping from neural\nsubstrates to syllables are important features of the neural control of complex\nsong syntax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 18:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-22"}

The\ndistribution of stars in the disk is lop-sided, in the sense that the projected\ndensity of AGB stars in the north east portion of the disk between 10 and 20\nkpc from the galaxy center is ~ 0.5 dex higher than on the opposite side of the\ngalaxy. With the exception of the central 2 kpc, the north east portion of the\ndisk appears to have been the site of the highest levels of star-forming\nactivity in the galaxy during the past ~ 0.1 Gyr. Diffuse stellar structures\nare found in the periphery of the disk, and the most prominent of these is to\nthe south and east of the galaxy. Bright AGB stars are detected out to 15 kpc\nabove the disk plane, and these are part of a diffusely distributed, flattened\nextraplanar component. Comparisons between observed and model luminosity\nfunctions suggest that the extraplanar regions contain stars that formed\nthroughout much of the age of the Universe. It is suggested that the disk of\nNGC 253 was disrupted by a tidal encounter with a now defunct companion. The\nages of the youngest extraplanar stars suggests that the event that produced\nthe extraplanar population, and presumably induced the starburst, occured\nwithin the past ~ 0.2 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 18:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A preliminary\nmorphological study suggests that the increase in the blue fraction at lower\nrichnesses may have a non-negligible contribution from spiral galaxies.

After some comments on the nature and\nnecessity of decoherence in open systems and its absence in closed ones, we\nprove sharp, state-independent inequalities reflecting the Heisenberg\nprinciple, the necessity of decoherence and the impossibility of perfect joint\nmeasurement. These bounds are used to judge how far a particular measurement is\nremoved from the optimal one. We do this for a qubit interacting with the\nquantized EM field, continually probed using homodyne detection. We calculate\nto which extent this joint measurement is optimal. We then propose a two-step\nstrategy to determine the (possibly mixed) state of n identically prepared\nqubits, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in a local minimax sense,\nusing `Quantum Local Asymptotic Normality' for qubits. We propose a physical\nimplementation of QLAN, based on interaction with the quantized EM field. In\ndifferential geometry, a bundle is called `natural' if diffeomorphisms of the\nbase lift to automorphisms of the bundle. We slightly extend this notion to\n`infinitesimal naturality', requiring only vector fields (infinitesimal\ndiffeomorphisms) to lift. We classify these bundles. Physical fields that\ntransform under (infinitesimal) space-time transformations must be described in\nterms of (infinitesimally) natural bundles. All spin structures are\ninfinitesimally natural. Our framework thus encompasses Fermionic fields, for\nwhich the notion of a natural bundle is too restrictive. Interestingly,\ngeneralized spin structures (e.g. spin-c structures) are not always\ninfinitesimally natural. We classify the ones that are. Depending on the gauge\ngroup at hand, this can significantly reduce the number of allowed space-time\ntopologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 20:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-15"}

The\ncores are modeled as critically stable self-gravitating spheres embedded at the\ncenter of self-gravitating filaments that are assumed to be either spherical or\ncylindrical in shape. The filaments are heated by an isotropic interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF). The calculations are based on a physical dust model of\nstochastically heated grains of diffuse interstellar dust. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the cores is calculated using a ray-tracing technique\nwhere the effects of scattered emission and re-heating by dust grains are\naccurately taken into account. To compare with observational studies, the dust\nre-emission spectrum is approximated by a modified black-body function and the\nbrightness profile with a Gaussian source. A simplified single-zone model for\ncores is presented that incorporates on the basis of the derived emissivities a\nfirst order approximation of their SED. Colder dust temperatures are,\nindependent of the core mass, related to a higher pressure both inside and\naround the filament. The pressure-temperature relation for given external\npressure is found to be largely independent of the true shape of the filament.\nThe calculations show that the radiative transfer leads to a lower emission\ncoefficient at 250 micron and to a flatter emissivity law of typically beta<1.8\nin the far-infrared sub-millimeter regime. These effects cause the core mass to\nbe underestimated by more than a factor of 2 based on the typical assumptions\nused in observational programs. A larger uncertainty is expected for high\npressure regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2010 01:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

Using the observed\nbroadband data, we study the origin of the high energy emission, and suggest\nthat the early-time GeV emission and the late-time radio, optical, and X-ray\nafterglows can be understood as being due to synchrotron emission from an\nexternal forward shock caused by structured ejecta propagating in a wind bubble\njumping to a homogeneous density medium. If the ceasing time for majority of\nthe energy injection is assumed to be close to the deceleration time of the\nforward shock, the structured ejecta with continuous energy injection to the\nforward shock can well explain the early rising feature of the GeV mission from\nthese burst, and the density-jump medium can account for some certain plateaus\nor flares in the late afterglows. From our fits, we find that, on one hand, the\nexternal shock origin of the GeV photons will make the optical depth have not\nsignificant contribution to the early LAT rising part, which will loosen strong\nconstraint of lower limits of Lorentz factor.

One reason for the paucity of such\nobservations is the lack of knowledge of their rotation periods. The\nsharp-lined young Herbig Ae star HD101412 with a strong surface magnetic field\nbecame in the last years one of the most studied targets among the Herbig Ae/Be\nstars.\n  A few months ago we obtained multi-epoch polarimetric spectra of this star\nwith FORS2 to search for a rotation period and to constrain the geometry of the\nmagnetic field.\n  We measured longitudinal magnetic fields on 13 different epochs distributed\nover 62 days. These new measurements together with our previous measurements of\nthe magnetic field in this star were combined with available photometric\nobservations to determine the rotation period.\n  The search of the rotation period resulted in P=42.076+-0.01d. According to\nnear-infrared imaging studies the star is observed nearly edge-on. The star\nexhibits a single-wave variation of the longitudinal magnetic field during the\nstellar rotation cycle. These observations are usually considered as evidence\nfor a dominant dipolar contribution to the magnetic field topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2010 13:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

But for quantum control systems, the\ncapability of measurement-based feedback control (MFC) has not been\ninvestigated systematically. In contrast to the control of classical systems\nwhere the measurement effect is negligible, the quantum measurement will cause\na quantum state to collapse, which will inevitably introduce additional\nuncertainties besides the system initial uncertainty. Therefore, there is a\ncomplicated tradeoff between the uncertainty introduced and the information\ngained by the measurement, and thus a theoretical investigation of the\ncapability of MFC is of fundamental importance. In this paper, inspired by both\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle for quantum systems and the investigation\nof the feedback capability for classical systems, we try to answer the\nfollowing three basic questions: (i) How to choose the measurement channel\nappropriately? (ii) Is the MFC still superior to the open loop control in\ndealing with the system information uncertainties? and (iii) What is the\nmaximum capability or limitation of the MFC? These questions will be answered\ntheoretically by establishing several theorems concerning the asymptotic\nreachability of eigenstates of a typical class of Hamiltonian control mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2010 13:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

We report the discovery of a radio minihalo in RXCJ1504.1-0248, a\nmassive galaxy cluster that has an extremely luminous cool core.

Methods. The diffuse\nradio source is detected using GMRT at 327 MHz and confirmed by pointed VLA\ndata at 1.46 GHz. The minihalo has a radius of $\\sim$140 kpc. A Chandra gas\ntemperature map shows that the minihalo emission fills the cluster cool core\nand has some morphological similarities to it, as has been previously observed\nfor other minihalos. Results. The Chandra data reveal two subtle cold fronts in\nthe cool core, likely created by sloshing of the core gas, as observed in most\ncool-core clusters. Following previous work, we speculate that the origin of\nthe minihalo is related to sloshing. Sloshing may result in particle\nacceleration by generating turbulence and/or amplifying the magnetic field in\nthe cool core, leading to the formation of a minihalo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2010 15:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
