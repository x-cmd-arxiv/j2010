In economics, there is a stable stationary state with\nhigh employment, which corresponds to mass production of conventional goods\nsold at low cost price, and an unstable stationary state with lower employment,\nwhich corresponds to production of novel goods appearing in the course of\ntechnological progress. An additional stable stationary state is described for\neconomics, the one corresponding to very low employment in production of life\nessentials such as energy and raw materials. In this state the civilization\ncurrently pays 10% of global GDP for energy produced by a negligible minority\nof the working population (currently ~0.2%) and sold at prices greatly\nexceeding the cost price by 40 times.

The armchair edges of\nBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) are more stable in energy than zigzag ones. Armchair\nBNNRs are under compressive edge stress while zigzag BNNRs are under tensile\nedge stress. The intrinsic spin-polarization and edge saturation play important\nroles in modulating the edge stability of BNNRs. The edge energy difference\nbetween BN and graphene could be used to guide the design of the specific\nhybrid BNC structures: in an armchair BNC nanoribbon (BNCNR), BN domains are\nexpected to grow outside of C domains, while the opposite occurs in a zigzag\nBNCNR. More importantly, armchair BNCNRs can reproduce unique electronic\nproperties of armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are expected to be\nrobust against edge functionalization or disorder.

We detected a total of 61 X-ray sources within 35'\n$\\times$ 30' of the galaxy down to a luminosity of (1-2)$\\times$1037 erg s-1\ndepending on the local background. We found that 39 of the 61 detected sources\nshowed long-term variability, in which 26 of them were classified as X-ray\ntransients. We also found 19 sources exhibiting variations in hardness ratios\nor undergoing spectral transitions among observations, and were identified as\nspectral variables. In particular, 8 of the identified X-ray transients showed\nspectral variability in addition to flux variability. The diverse patterns of\nvariability observed is indicative of a population of X-ray binaries. We used\nX-ray colors, flux and spectral variability, and in some cases the optical or\nradio counterparts to classify the detected X-ray sources into several stellar\npopulations. We identified a total of 11 foreground stars, 1 supersoft sources\n(SSS), 3 quasisoft sources (QSS), and 2 supernova remnants (SNR). The\nidentified SSS/QSS are located near or on the spiral arms, associate with young\nstellar populations; the 2 SNR are very close to the starburst nucleus where\ncurrent star formation activities are dominated. We also discovered a spectral\nchange in the nuclear source of IC342 for the first time by a series of X-ray\nspectrum analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 04:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

For a multicast routing algorithm to be\napplicable in optical networks, it must route data only to group members,\noptimize and maintain loop-free routes, and concentrate the routes on a subset\nof network links. For an all-optical switch to play the role of a branching\nrouter, it must be equipped with a light splitter. Light splitters are\nexpensive equipments and therefore it will be very expensive to implement\nsplitters on all optical switches. Optical light splitters are only implemented\non some optical switches. That limited availability of light splitters raises a\nnew problem when we want to implement multicast protocols in optical network\n(because usual multicast protocols make the assumption that all nodes have\nbranching capabilities). Another issue is the knowledge of the locations of\nlight splitters in the optical network. Nodes in the network should be able to\nidentify the locations of light splitters scattered in the optical network so\nit can construct multicast trees.

Stippling is the art of rendering\nimages using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes,\nelementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only\nfor the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial\nformat for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by\nconstruction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering\nfrom bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for\nstippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a\nwell-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content,\nand is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as\nimage sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the\nresult of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts\nand can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable\nartifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by\nconsidering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene\nsemantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while\nadjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain\nhow to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic\nspatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like\nquick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical\nperformances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results\nrendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic\nrescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 15:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

We report observations of 57 complete X-ray eclipses,\nmade with the proportional counter array detectors aboard the RXTE satellite.\nUsing the eclipse timing technique, we have derived a constant orbital period\nof 0.1367109674 (3) d, during the period from MJD 52132 upto MJD 54410; and\n1{\\sigma} limits of -1.6 $\\times$ 10^ -12 d d-1 and 0.2 $\\times$ 10^ -12 d d-1\n, on the period derivative. This puts constraints on the minimum timescale of\nsecular orbital period evolution of 2.34 $\\times$ 10^8 yr for a period decay\nand 18.7 $\\times$ 10^8 yr for a period increase. We also report detection of\ntwo instances of discontinuity in the mid-eclipse time, one before and one\nafter the above MJD range. These results are interpreted as three distinct\nepochs of orbital period in XTE J1710-281. We have put lower limits of 1.4 ms\nand 0.9 ms on orbital period change at successive epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 15:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
