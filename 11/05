We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nprompt emission in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime, namely, the\nInternal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model.\nIt is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent,\nmagnetically-dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is\nstill moderately magnetized. Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the\nmini-shells interact internally at the traditional internal shock radius. Most\nof these early collision have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort\nthe ordered magnetic field lines. At a certain point, the distortion of\nmagnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast\nreconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the\ninteraction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing\nadditional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored\nmagnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles accelerated in the ICMART\nregion radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma-rays. Each\nICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB lightcurve, and a GRB is\ncomposed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of the IS and\nother models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS\nmodel (e.g. low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess,\nAmati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). It\npredicts two-component variability time scales, and a decreasing Ep and\npolarization degree during each ICMART event. The model may be applied to most\nFermi LAT GRBs that have time-resolved, featureless Band-function spectra\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 16:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2010 19:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

It has been proposed that MHD\nturbulence, generated during cluster-cluster mergers, may be a source of\nparticle reacceleration in the IGM. Calculations of turbulent acceleration must\naccount self-consistently for the complex non--linear coupling between\nturbulent waves and particles. This has been calculated in some detail under\nthe assumption that turbulence interacts in a collisionless way with the IGM.\nIn this paper we explore a different picture of acceleration by compressible\nturbulence in galaxy clusters, where the interaction between turbulence and the\nIGM is mediated by plasma instabilities and maintained collisional at scales\nmuch smaller than the Coulomb mean free path. In this regime most of the energy\nof fast modes is channeled into the reacceleration of relativistic particles\nand the acceleration process approaches a universal behaviour being\nself-regulated by the back-reaction of the accelerated particles on turbulence\nitself. Assuming that relativistic protons contribute to several percent (or\nless) of the cluster energy, consistent with the FERMI observations of nearby\nclusters, we find that compressible turbulence at the level of a few percent of\nthe thermal energy can reaccelerate relativistic electrons at GeV energies,\nthat are necessary to explain the observed diffuse radio emission in the form\nof giant radio halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 16:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nsynthesis is done by a light-directed chemical process. The objective is to\nminimize unintended illumination that may contaminate the quality of\nexperiments. Unintended illumination is measured by a notion called border\nlength and the problem is called Border Minimization Problem (BMP). The\nobjective of the BMP is to place a set of probe sequences in the array and find\nan embedding (deposition of nucleotides/residues to the array cells) such that\nthe sum of border length is minimized. A variant of the problem, called P-BMP,\nis that the placement is given and the concern is simply to find the embedding.\nApproximation algorithms have been previously proposed for the problem but it\nis unknown whether the problem is NP-hard or not. In this paper, we give a\nthorough study of different variations of BMP by giving NP-hardness proofs and\nimproved approximation algorithms. We show that P-BMP, 1D-BMP, and BMP are all\nNP-hard. Contrast with the previous result that 1D-P-BMP is polynomial time\nsolvable, the interesting implications include (i) the array dimension (1D or\n2D) differentiates the complexity of P-BMP; (ii) for 1D array, whether\nplacement is given differentiates the complexity of BMP; (iii) BMP is NP-hard\nregardless of the dimension of the array.

Using multi-band photometry from GROND and\nSwift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic\nredshifts are not available. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic\nphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric\nredshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow\nsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry\nto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. The\nmeasurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and\nreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in\nthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be\nobtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the\nrelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and better\nthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without\nspectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND. The\ndistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be\n$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 080825B, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for GRB\n080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for GRB 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ for\nGRB 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 090530. Combining the response\nfrom UVOT with ground-based observatories and in particular GROND operating in\nthe optical/NIR wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~\n1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorable\ncases, provided that these GRBs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficiently\nbright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 16:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

The evolution of the\nphotospheric magnetic field is described and used to estimate how much flux is\nreconnected into the flux rope. About one third of the active region flux\ncancels at the internal polarity inversion line in the 2.5~days leading up to\nthe eruption. In this period, the coronal structure evolves from a weakly to a\nhighly sheared arcade and then to a sigmoid that crosses the inversion line in\nthe inverse direction. These properties suggest that a flux rope has formed\nprior to the eruption. The amount of cancellation implies that up to 60% of the\nactive region flux could be in the body of the flux rope. We point out that\nonly part of the cancellation contributes to the flux in the rope if the arcade\nis only weakly sheared, as in the first part of the evolution. This reduces the\nestimated flux in the rope to $\\sim\\!30%$ or less of the active region flux. We\nsuggest that the remaining discrepancy between our estimate and the limiting\nvalue of $\\sim\\!10%$ of the active region flux, obtained previously by the flux\nrope insertion method, results from the incomplete coherence of the flux rope,\ndue to nonuniform cancellation along the polarity inversion line. A hot linear\nfeature is observed in the active region which rises as part of the eruption\nand then likely traces out field lines close to the axis of the flux rope. The\nflux cancellation and changing magnetic connections at one end of this feature\nsuggest that the flux rope reaches coherence by reconnection shortly before and\nearly in the impulsive phase of the associated flare. The sigmoid is destroyed\nin the eruption but reforms within a few hours after a moderate amount of\nfurther cancellation has occurred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 17:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}

In 2007, Alpers and\nTijdeman gave examples of solutions to the PTE problem over the Gaussian\nintegers. This paper extends the framework of the problem to this setting. We\nprove generalizations of results from the literature, and use this information\nalong with computational techniques to find ideal solutions to the PTE problem\nin the Gaussian integers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 20:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 19:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-15"}

We show that a number of these\nresults follow easily from the application of a single probabilistic method\ncalled Precision Sampling. Using this method, we obtain simple data-stream\nalgorithms that maintain a randomized sketch of an input vector\n$x=(x_1,...x_n)$, which is useful for the following applications. 1) Estimating\nthe $F_k$-moment of $x$, for $k>2$. 2) Estimating the $\\ell_p$-norm of $x$, for\n$p\\in[1,2]$, with small update time. 3) Estimating cascaded norms\n$\\ell_p(\\ell_q)$ for all $p,q>0$. 4) $\\ell_1$ sampling, where the goal is to\nproduce an element $i$ with probability (approximately) $|x_i|/\\|x\\|_1$. It\nextends to similarly defined $\\ell_p$-sampling, for $p\\in [1,2]$.\n  For all these applications the algorithm is essentially the same: scale the\nvector x entry-wise by a well-chosen random vector, and run a heavy-hitter\nestimation algorithm on the resulting vector. Our sketch is a linear function\nof x, thereby allowing general updates to the vector x.\n  Precision Sampling itself addresses the problem of estimating a sum\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ from weak estimates of each real $a_i\\in[0,1]$. More\nprecisely, the estimator first chooses a desired precision $u_i\\in(0,1]$ for\neach $i\\in[n]$, and then it receives an estimate of every $a_i$ within additive\n$u_i$. Its goal is to provide a good approximation to $\\sum a_i$ while keeping\na tab on the \"approximation cost\" $\\sum_i (1/u_i)$. Here we refine previous\nwork [Andoni, Krauthgamer, and Onak, FOCS 2010] which shows that as long as\n$\\sum a_i=\\Omega(1)$, a good multiplicative approximation can be achieved using\ntotal precision of only $O(n\\log n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 20:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 02:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-26"}

We study stationary\nlocalized modes in a symmetric linearly coupled system of two such equations,\nfocusing on asymmetric states. The model may describe \"optical bullets\" in\ndual-core nonlinear optical waveguides (including spatiotemporal vortices that\nwere not discussed before), or a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a\n\"dual-pancake\" trap. Each family of solutions in the single-component model has\ntwo different counterparts in the coupled system, one symmetric and one\nasymmetric. Similarly to the earlier studied coupled 1D system with the CQ\nnonlinearity, the present model features bifurcation loops, for fundamental and\nvortex solitons alike: with the increase of the total energy (norm), the\nsymmetric solitons become unstable at a point of the direct bifurcation, which\nis followed, at larger values of the energy, by the reverse bifurcation\nrestabilizing the symmetric solitons. However, on the contrary to the 1D\nsystem, the system may demonstrate a double bistability for the fundamental\nsolitons. The stability of the solitons is investigated via the computation of\ninstability growth rates for small perturbations. Vortex rings, which we study\nfor two values of the \"spin\", s = 1 and 2, may be subject to the azimuthal\ninstability, like in the single-component model. We also develop a\nquasi-analytical approach to the description of the bifurcations diagrams,\nbased on the variational approximation.

We calibrate galaxy redshifts measured from rest-frame UV lines by\nutilizing the fact that the mean HI Ly-alpha absorption profiles around the\ngalaxies, as seen in spectra of background objects, must be symmetric with\nrespect to the true galaxy redshifts if the galaxies are oriented randomly with\nrespect to the lines of sight to the background objects. We use 15 QSOs at\nz~2.5-3 and more than 600 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at\nz~1.9-2.5. All galaxies are within 2 Mpc proper from the lines of sight to the\nbackground QSOs. We find that LyA emission and ISM absorption redshifts require\nsystematic shifts of v_LyA=-295(+35)(-35) km/s and v_ISM=145(+70)(-35) km/s.\nAssuming a Gaussian distribution, we put 1-sigma upper limits on possible\nrandom redshift offsets of <220 km/s for LyA and <420 km/s for ISM redshifts.\nFor the small subset (<10%) of galaxies for which near-IR spectra have been\nobtained, we can compare our results to direct measurements based on nebular\nemission lines which we confirm to mark the systemic redshifts. While our v_ISM\nagrees with the direct measurements, our v_LyA is significantly smaller.\nHowever, when we apply our method to the near-IR subsample which is\ncharacterized by slightly different selection effects, the best-fit velocity\noffset comes into agreement with the direct measurement. This confirms the\nvalidity of our approach, and implies that no single number appropriately\ndescribes the whole population of galaxies, in line with the observation that\nthe line offset depends on galaxy spectral morphology.

Such expansions should exhibit marked improvement over the\nconventional three-flavor chiral expansion. Although in principle one can\nformulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness\nof kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of such two-flavor\ntheories in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual kaon thresholds\non hyperon properties, specifically their isovector axial charges and\nelectromagnetic observables. In particular we uncover the underlying expansion\nparameter governing the description of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half\nhyperons, this expansion parameter is under theoretical control. As a result,\nthe virtual kaon contributions are well described in the two-flavor theory by\nterms analytic in the pion mass-squared. For spin three-half hyperons, however,\none is closer to the kaon production threshold, and the expansion parameter is\nnot as small. Breakdown of $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory is shown to arise\nfrom a pole in the expansion parameter associated with the kaon threshold. We\nfind that, despite the fact that higher-order corrections to the expansion\nparameter is necessary to ascertain whether the two-flavor theory of spin\nthree-half hyperons remains perturbative, there is a useful perturbative\nexpansion for isovector axial charges and magnetic moments of both spin-half\nand spin three-half hyperons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 00:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

The first approach deals with a broad beam\nlaunched into the dissipative nonlinear medium, which is equipped with an\nimprinted grating of a sufficiently sharp form. The beam splits into a cluster\nof jets, each subsequently self-trapping into a stable soliton, if the power is\nsufficient for that. We consider two kinds of sharp gratings -- \"raised-cosine\"\n(RC) and Kronig-Penney (KP) lattices -- and two types of the input beams,\nfundamental and vortical. By selecting appropriate parameters, this method\nmakes it possible to create various types of solitons arrays, such as solid,\nannular (with single and double rings), and cross-shaped ones. The second\nmethod uses a \"virtual lattice\", in the form of a periodic transverse phase\nmodulation imprinted into the broad beam, which is passed through an\nappropriate phase mask and then shone into a uniform nonlinear medium. Two\ndifferent types of the masks are considered, in the form of a \"checkerboard\" or\n\"tilings\". In that case, broad fundamental and vortical beams may also evolve\ninto stable SSAs, if the beam's power and spacing of the virtual phase lattice\nare large enough. By means of the latter technique, square-shaped, hexagonal,\nand quasi-crystalline SSAs can be created.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 01:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Our calculated band structure shows that\nthere is significant O2p-Ti3d hybridization in the valence bands. These bands\nare well separated from the conduction bands by an indirect band gap of 2.95\neV, from {\\Gamma} to R. Consequently, this work predicts that rutile TiO2 is an\nindirect band gap material, as all other gaps from our calculations are larger\nthan 2.95 eV. We found a slightly larger, direct band gap of 3.05 eV, at the\n{\\Gamma} point, in excellent agreement with experiment. Our calculations\nreproduced the peaks in the measured conduction and valence bands densities of\nstates, within experimental uncertainties. We also calculated electron\neffective mass. Our structural optimization led to lattice parameters of 4.65\n{\\AA} and 2.97 {\\AA} for a_{0} and c_{0}, respectively with a u parameter of\n0.3051 and a bulk modulus of 215 GPa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 03:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 23:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 06:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

The purity is known to be a good measure of\ncondensation, and this result clarifies the relevance of the condensation to\nthe interference. The fluctuation of the interference spectrum is also studied,\nand it is shown that the fluctuation is vanishingly small below the critical\ntemperature, while it is nonvanishing above.

We adopt these ideas towards the goal of showing lower bounds on the\nborder rank of specific tensors, in particular for matrix multiplication. We\nthus study specific orbit closure problems for the group $G = GL(W_1)\\times\nGL(W_2)\\times GL(W_3)$ acting on the tensor product $W=W_1\\otimes W_2\\otimes\nW_3$ of complex finite dimensional vector spaces.

In neuroscience, many models for the membrane\npotential evolution involve the presence of an upper threshold. Data are\nmodeled as discretely observed diffusions which are killed when the threshold\nis reached. Statistical inference is often based on the misspecified likelihood\nignoring the presence of the threshold causing severe bias, e.g. the bias\nincurred in the drift parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for biological\nrelevant parameters can be up to 25-100%. We calculate or approximate the\nlikelihood function of the killed process. When estimating from a single\ntrajectory, considerable bias may still be present, and the distribution of the\nestimates can be heavily skewed and with a huge variance.

This harmonic is antisymmetric with respect to the equator\nand its period (and growth rate) depends on the differential rotation\nparameters and the magnetic field strength. The oscillations may cause a\nperiodic magnetic flux emergence at the solar surface and consequently may lead\nto the observed QBO in the solar activity features.

Although the purchase and sale of private data has\nalready begun on a large scale, a theory of privacy as a commodity is missing.\nIn this paper, we propose to build such a theory. Specifically, we consider a\nsetting in which a data analyst wishes to buy information from a population\nfrom which he can estimate some statistic. The analyst wishes to obtain an\naccurate estimate cheaply. On the other hand, the owners of the private data\nexperience some cost for their loss of privacy, and must be compensated for\nthis loss. Agents are selfish, and wish to maximize their profit, so our goal\nis to design truthful mechanisms. Our main result is that such auctions can\nnaturally be viewed and optimally solved as variants of multi-unit procurement\nauctions. Based on this result, we derive auctions for two natural settings\nwhich are optimal up to small constant factors:\n  1. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed accuracy goal, we\nshow that an application of the classic Vickrey auction achieves the analyst's\naccuracy goal while minimizing his total payment.\n  2. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed budget, we give a\nmechanism which maximizes the accuracy of the resulting estimate while\nguaranteeing that the resulting sum payments do not exceed the analysts budget.\n  In both cases, our comparison class is the set of envy-free mechanisms, which\ncorrespond to the natural class of fixed-price mechanisms in our setting.\n  In both of these results, we ignore the privacy cost due to possible\ncorrelations between an individuals private data and his valuation for privacy\nitself. We then show that generically, no individually rational mechanism can\ncompensate individuals for the privacy loss incurred due to their reported\nvaluations for privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 12:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 15:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 21:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 14:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-30"}

The results presented here include parallaxes\nof 10 targets from observations over 18 months and a first version proper\nmotion catalog. The proper motions were obtained by combining PARSEC\nobservations astrometrically reduced with respect to the UCAC2 Catalog, and the\n2MASS Catalog. The resulting median proper motion precision is 5mas/yr for\n195,700 sources. The 140 0.3deg2 fields sample the southern hemisphere in an\nunbiased fashion with the exception of the galactic plane due to the small\nnumber of targets in that region. We present preliminary parallaxes with a 4.2\nmas median precision for 10 brown dwarfs, 2 of which are within 10pc. These\nincrease by 20% the present number of L dwarfs with published parallaxes.

On tip retraction, the molecule is\npeeled off the surface. During this experiment, a two-dimensional differential\nconductance map is measured on the plane spanned by the bias voltage and the\ntip-surface distance. The conductance map demonstrates that tip retraction\nleads to mechanical gating of the molecular wire in the STM junction. The\nexperiments are compared with a detailed ab initio simulation. We find that\ndensity functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA)\ndescribes the tip-molecule contact formation and the geometry of the molecular\njunction throughout the peeling process with predictive power. However, a\nDFT-LDA-based transport simulation following the non-equilibrium Green's\nfunctions (NEGF) formalism fails to describe the behavior of the differential\nconductance as found in experiment. Further analysis reveals that this failure\nis due to the mean-field description of electron correlation in the local\ndensity approximation. The results presented here are expected to be of general\nvalidity and show that, for a wide range of common wire configurations,\nsimulations which go beyond the mean-field level are required to accurately\ndescribe current conduction through molecules.

Here we study the nanorod coupling in various cases, including\nnanorod dimer with the asymmetrical lengths and symmetrical dimer with the\nvarying gap width. The asymmetrical nanorod dimer causes two plasmon modes: one\nis the attractive lower- energy mode and the other the repulsive high-energy\nmode. Using a simple coupled LC-resonator model, the position of dimer\nresonance has been determined analytically. Moreover, we found that the plasmon\ncoupling of symmetrical cylindrical (or rectangular) nanorod dimer is governed\nuniquely by gap width scaled for the (effective) rod radius rather than for the\nrod length. A new Plasmon Ruler Equation without using the fitting parameters\nhas been proposed, which agrees well with the FDTD calculations. The method has\nalso been extended to study the plasmonic wave-guiding in a linear chain of\ngold nanorod particles. A field decay length up to 2700nm with the lateral mode\nsize about 50nm (~wavelength/28) has been suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 14:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

Roll structures in the cross-stream/spanwise plane and\nassociated streamwise streaks are shown to arise as a linear instability of\ninteraction between the FST and the mean flow. In this interaction incoherent\nReynolds stresses arising from FST are organized by perturbation streamwise\nstreaks to coherently force perturbation rolls giving rise to an amplification\nof the streamwise streak perturbation and through this feedback to an\ninstability of the combined roll/streak/turbulence complex. The dominant\nturbulent perturbation structures involved in supporting the\nroll/streak/turbulence complex instability are non-normal optimal perturbations\nwith the form of oblique waves. The cooperative linear instability giving rise\nto the roll/streak structure arises at a bifurcation in the parameter of STM\nexcitation parameter. This structural instability eventually equilibrates\nnonlinearly at finite amplitude and although the resulting statistical\nequilibrium streamwise streaks are inflectional the associated flows are\nstable. Formation and equilibration of the roll/streak structure by this\nmechanism can be traced to the non-normality which underlies interaction\nbetween perturbations and mean flows in modally stable systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 15:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Quantum field theory has photons in\nthermal radiation but not in the vacuum state; classical theory has radiation\nin both situations. The contrast in interpretations is most striking for the\nRindler coordinate frame accelerating through zero-point radiation; classical\ntheory continues tensor behavior over to the Rindler frame, whereas quantum\ntheory introduces a new Rindler vacuum state.

The results for this quantity which have been obtained by several\ndifferent lattice simulation methods differ due to different numbers of\nflavors, different pion masses and different sizes of the simulation volume. In\norder to reconcile these results, it is important to investigate finite-volume\neffects on the curvature. We investigate the curvature of the chiral phase\ntransition line at finite temperature and chemical potential in a finite\nvolume. We use a phenomenological model for chiral symmetry breaking and apply\nnon-perturbative functional renormalization group methods which account for\ncritical long-range fluctuations at the phase transition. We find an\nintermediate volume region in which the curvature of the phase transition line\nis actually reduced relative to its infinite-volume value, provided periodic\nspatial boundary conditions are chosen for the quark fields. Size and location\nof this region depend on the value of the pion mass. Such an effect could\naccount for differences in the curvature between lattice simulations in\ndifferently sized volumes and from functional methods in the infinite volume\nlimit.
