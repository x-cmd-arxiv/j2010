Examples of these waves are standing\ntransverse motions, interpreted as the kink MHD modes, and propagating slow\nmodes, commonly reported at the loop footpoints. Here we study a simple system\nin which fast and slow MHD waves are coupled. The goal is to understand the\nfingerprints of the coupling when boundary conditions are imposed in the model.\nThe reflection problem of a fast and slow MHD wave interacting with a rigid\nboundary, representing the line-tying effect of the photosphere, is\nanalytically investigated. Both propagating and standing waves are analysed and\nthe time-dependent problem of the excitation of these waves is considered. An\nobliquely incident fast MHD wave on the photosphere inevitably generates a slow\nmode. The frequency of the generated slow mode at the photosphere is exactly\nthe same as the frequency of the incident fast MHD mode, but its wavelength is\nmuch smaller, assuming that the sound speed is smaller than the Alfv\\'en speed.\nThe main signatures of the generated slow wave are density fluctuations at the\nloop footpoints. We have derived a simple formula that relates the velocity\namplitude of the transverse standing mode with the density enhancements at the\nfootpoints due to the driven slow modes. Using these results it is shown that\nthere are possible evidences in the observations of the coupling between these\ntwo modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 16:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We compile data from the literature on star clusters, star-forming\nsubregions, normal star-forming galaxies, and starbursts to assess the\nimportance of radiation pressure on dust as a feedback mechanism, by comparing\nthe luminosity and flux of these systems to their dust Eddington limit. This\nexercise motivates a novel interpretation of the Schmidt Law, the LIR-L'CO\ncorrelation, and the LIR-L'HCN correlation. In particular, the linear LIR-L'HCN\ncorrelation is a natural prediction of radiation pressure regulated star\nformation. Overall, we find that the Eddington limit sets a hard upper bound to\nthe luminosity of any star-forming region. Importantly, however, many normal\nstar-forming galaxies have luminosities significantly below the Eddington\nlimit. We explore several explanations for this discrepancy, especially the\nrole of \"intermittency\" in normal spirals - the tendency for only a small\nnumber of subregions within a galaxy to be actively forming stars at any moment\nbecause of the time-dependence of the feedback process and the luminosity\nevolution of the stellar population. If radiation pressure regulates star\nformation in dense gas, then the gas depletion timescale is 6 Myr, in good\nagreement with observations of the densest starbursts. Finally, we highlight\nthe importance of observational uncertainties - namely, the dust-to-gas ratio\nand the CO-H2 and HCN-H2 conversion factors - that must be understood before a\ndefinitive assessment of radiation pressure as a feedback mechanism in\nstar-forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 17:57:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 14:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

HCO+ emission is a star\nformation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2)\n~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. We derive a\nlensing-corrected HCO+(J=4-3) line luminosity of L'(HCO+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x\n10^9 (mu_L/11)^-1 K km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the HCO+(J=1=0)\nluminosity, and <~4% of the CO(J=3-2) luminosity. The HCO+ excitation thus is\nclearly subthermal in the J=4-3 transition. Modeling of the HCO+ line radiative\ntransfer suggests that the HCO+ emission emerges from a region with physical\nproperties comparable to that exhibiting the CO line emission, but 2x higher\ngas density. This suggests that both HCO+ and CO lines trace the warm, dense\nmolecular gas where star formation actively takes place. The HCO+ lines have\nonly ~2/3 the width of the CO lines, which may suggest that the densest gas is\nmore spatially concentrated. In contrast to the z=3.91 quasar APM08279+5255,\nthe dense gas excitation in the Cloverleaf is consistent with being purely\ncollisional, rather than being enhanced by radiative processes. Thus, the\nphysical properties of the dense gas component in the Cloverleaf are consistent\nwith those in the nuclei of nearby starburst galaxies.

Only high-energy spectroscopy therefore, allows examination of the\nmatter close to the burst itself. Soft X-ray absorption allows an estimate to\nbe made of the total column density in metals. The detection of the X-ray\nafterglow can also be used to place a limit on the total gas column along the\nline of sight based on the Compton scattering opacity. Such a limit would\nenable, for the first time, the determination of lower limits on the\nmetallicity in the circumburst environments of GRBs. In this paper, we\ndetermine the limits that can be placed on the total gas column density in the\nvicinities of GRBs based on the Compton scattering. We simulate the effects of\nCompton scattering on a collimated beam of high energy photons passing through\na shell of high column density material to determine the expected lightcurves,\nluminosities, and spectra. We compare these predictions to observations, and\ndetermine what limits can realistically be placed on the total gas column\ndensity. The smearing out of pulses in the lightcurve from Compton scattering\nis not likely to be observable, and its absence does not place strong\nconstraints on the Compton depth for GRBs. However, the distribution of\nobserved luminosities of bursts allows us to place statistical, model-dependent\nlimits that are typically <~1e25 cm^{-2} for less luminous bursts, and as low\nas ~1e24 cm$^{-2} for the most luminous. Using the shape of the high-energy\nbroadband spectrum, however, in some favourable cases, limits as low as ~5e24\ncm^{-2} can placed on individual bursts, implying metallicity lower limits from\nX- and gamma-rays alone from 0 up to 0.01 Z/Zsun. At extremely high redshifts,\nthis limit would be at least 0.02 Z/Z_sun, enough to discriminate population\nIII from non-primordial GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 21:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

Depending\non the strength and density of the substrate disorder, we find that there can\nbe pronounced anisotropy in the transport produced by different dynamical flow\nphases. We also find a disorder-induced \"peak effect\" similar to that observed\nfor superconducting vortex systems, which is marked by a transition from\nelastic depinning to a state where the stripe structure fragments or partially\ndisorders at depinning. Under the sudden application of a driving force, we\nobserve pronounced metastability effects similar to those found near the\norder-disorder transition associated with the peak effect regime for\nthree-dimensional superconducting vortices. The characteristic transient time\nrequired for the system to reach a steady state diverges in the region where\nthe flow changes from elastic to disordered. We also find that anisotropy of\nthe flow persists in the presence of thermal disorder when thermally-induced\nparticle hopping along the stripes dominates. The thermal effects can wash out\nthe effects of the quenched disorder, leading to a thermally-induced stripe\nstate.

We find that\nthe Warm Spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science. For\nconsistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic Spitzer data\nfor secondary eclipses of CoRoT-2 at 4.5 and 8 microns. We compare the total\ndata for both planets, including optical eclipse measurements by the CoRoT\nmission, and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 microns, to existing\nmodels. Both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 microns,\nwhich is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. The spectrum\nof CoRoT-1 is best reproduced by a 2460K blackbody, due either to a high\naltitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermal\nregion in the planetary atmosphere. The spectrum of CoRoT-2 is unusual because\nthe 8 micron contrast is anomalously low. Non-inverted atmospheres could\npotentially produce the CoRoT-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emission\nfrom CO at 4.5 microns, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. However, the\nviability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannot\nbe more than about 30-percent larger than the planet's transit radius, based on\nthe ingress and egress times at eclipse. An alternative possibility to account\nfor the spectrum of CoRoT-2 is an additional opacity source that acts strongly\nat wavelengths less than 5 microns, heating the upper atmosphere while allowing\nthe deeper atmosphere seen at 8 microns to remain cooler. We obtain a similar\nresult as Gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of CoRoT-2,\nimplying an eccentric orbit with e*cos(omega)=-0.0030 +/- 0.0004.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 22:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A selective measurement (classical or quantum) can be used as a\n\"Maxwell's demon\" to power a single-temperature heat engine, by decreasing the\nentropy. Quantum mechanically, so can a non-selective measurement, despite\nincreasing the entropy of a thermal state. The maximal amount of work\nextractable following the measurement is given by the change in free energy:\n$W_{max}^{(non-)sel.}=\\Delta E_{meas}-T_{Bath}\\Delta S_{meas}^{(non-)sel.}$.\nThis follows from the \"generalized 2nd law for nonequilibrium initial state\"\n[Hasegawa et. al, PLA (2010)], of which an elementary reduction to the standard\nlaw is given here. It is shown that $W_{max}^{sel.}-W_{max}^{non-sel.}$ equals\nthe work required to reset the memory of the measuring device, and that no such\nresetting is needed in the non-selective case. Consequently, a single-bath\nengine powered by either kind of measurement works at a net loss of\n$T_{Bath}\\Delta S_{meas}^{non-sel}$ per cycle.

Recent experiments indicate a connection between the dynamical\ntransition and the dielectric response of the hydrated protein. We analyze two\nmechanisms of the coupling between the protein atomic motions and the\nprotein-water interface. The first mechanism considers viscoelastic changes in\nthe global shape of the protein plasticized by its coupling to the hydration\nshell. The second mechanism involves modulations of the motions of partial\ncharges inside the protein by electrostatic fluctuations. The model is used to\nanalyze mean square displacements of iron of metmyoglobin reported by\nMoessbauer spectroscopy. We show that high flexibility of heme iron at\nphysiological temperatures is dominated by electrostatic fluctuations.

This paper examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model\nthat is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the\nvariance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation.\nLike all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are\n\\textit{not} independent of the design matrix.\n  More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under\na sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for\nthe sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary\nconditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to\nresults for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal\nto noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and\nhomoscedastic data.\n  Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model\nselection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with\nproperly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as\na whole, these results suggest that the Lasso is robust to the Poisson-like\nheteroscedastic noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 22:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}

An\nATLAS alarm, augmented by other observations, should result in a determination\nof impact location and time that is accurate to a few kilometers and a few\nseconds. In addition to detecting and warning of approaching asteroids, ATLAS\nwill continuously monitor the changing universe around us: most of the variable\nstars in our galaxy, many micro-lensing events from stellar alignments,\nluminous stars and novae in nearby galaxies, thousands of supernovae, nearly a\nmillion quasars and active galactic nuclei, tens of millions of galaxies, and a\nbillion stars.

In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have\nbeen overestimated due to the use of rigid water models and flexible models in\nwhich the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic\nfunctions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model\nfor liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O--H stretches are described by\nMorse-type functions. We have parameterized this model to give the correct\nliquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infra-red absorption frequencies\nin quantum (path integral-based) simulations. By comparing classical and\nquantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations\nincrease the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in\nour model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is much smaller than that\nobserved in all previous simulations of simple empirical water models, which\nhave found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum\nsimulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our\nmodel is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy\nand tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen bonding network, leading to a\nless viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However this is offset\nby intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer\ngeometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular\ninteractions, and slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of\nsimulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we\nfind in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model\nto produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infra-red absorption\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 01:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}

These new results revealed\ndetailed distributions of the molecular gas and the line intensity ratio of the\ntwo transitions, R3-2/2-1. In the three loops, R3-2/2-1 is in a range from 0.1\nto 2.5 with a peak at ~ 0.7 while that in the disk molecular gas is in a range\nfrom 0.1 to 1.2 with a peak at 0.4.

The goal of such an analysis is to investigate\nalternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables\nthat lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In\nthis paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential\nignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is\nnonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with\nthose proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our\nidentification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator\nbased on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an\nACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that\nthese assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM\nframework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and\nperhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be\neasily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the\nexisting identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability\nassumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity\nanalysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings\nto the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the\nproposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology.

Numerical tests show that\nunconstrained inversion leads to reliable moment tensor solutions because of\nthe close proximity of numerous stations to the source positions. However,\nsingle forces cannot be accurately determined as they are very sensitive to\nuncertainties in the velocity model. Constrained inversions for a crack, a pipe\nor an explosion then allow us to accurately determine the structural\norientations of the source mechanisms. Both numerical tests and LP event\ninversions emphasise the importance of using stations located as close as\npossible to the source.

For Family 1 events, the crack geometry is nearly orthogonal to the\ndike-like structure along which events are located, while for Family 2 the\nlocation gave two pipe-like bodies which belong to the same plane as the crack\nmechanism.

The\nmethod, which is based on the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the time\nevolution operator and the Lanczos tridiagonalization scheme, efficiently\ntreats the propagation of phonon wave-packets in real-space and the phonon\ndiffusion coefficients. The mean free paths and the thermal conductance can be\ndetermined from the diffusion coefficients. These quantities can be extracted\nsimultaneously for all frequencies, which is another advantage in comparison\nwith the Green's function based approaches. Additionally, multiple scattering\nphenomena can be followed through the time dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient deep into the diffusive regime, and the onset of weak or strong\nphonon localization could possibly be revealed at low temperatures for thermal\ninsulators. The accuracy of our computational scheme is demonstrated by\ncomparing the calculated phonon mean free paths in isotope-disordered carbon\nnanotubes with Landauer simulations and analytical results. Then, the\nupscalibility of the method is illustrated by exploring the phonon mean free\npaths and the thermal conductance features of edge disordered graphene\nnanoribbons having widths of $\\sim$20 nanometers and lengths as long as a\nmicrometer, which are beyond the reach of other numerical techniques. It is\nshown that, the phonon mean free paths of armchair nanoribbons are smaller than\nthose of zigzag nanoribbons for the frequency range which dominate the thermal\nconductance at low temperatures. This computational strategy is applicable to\nhigher dimensional systems, as well as to a wide range of materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 11:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Since new surveys targeting M dwarfs will\nlikely be carried out at infrared wavelengths, a comparison between V and Y\nband starspot induced jitter is made, indicating a reduction of up to an order\nof magnitude when observing in the Y band. The exact reduction in jitter is\ndependent on the photosphere to spot contrast ratio, with greater improvements\nat smaller contrasts.

They introduced the concept of stability and optimality; and\nproposed the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm that is proven to lead to a\nstable and optimal solution. This algorithm is simple and computationally\nefficient. Furthermore, in subsequent studies it is shown that the DA algorithm\nis also strategy-proof, which means, when the algorithm is played out as a\nmechanism for matching two sides (e.g. colleges and students), the parties\n(colleges or students) have no incentives to act other than according to their\ntrue preferences. Yet, in practical college admission systems, the DA algorithm\nis often not adopted. Instead, an algorithm known as the Boston Mechanism (BM)\nor its variants are widely adopted. In BM, colleges accept students without\ndeferral (considering other colleges' decisions), which is exactly the opposite\nof Gale-Shapley's DA algorithm. To explain and rationalize this reality, we\nintroduce the notion of reciprocating preference to capture the influence of a\nstudent's interest on a college's decision. This model is inspired by the\nactual mechanism used to match students to universities in Hong Kong. The\nnotion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms,\nallowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and\ncolleges. DA and BM are but two extreme cases (with zero and a hundred percent\nreciprocation) of this set. This model extends the notion of stability and\noptimality as well. As in Gale-Shapley's original paper, we discuss how the\nanalogy can be carried over to the stable marriage problem, thus demonstrating\nthe model's general applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 12:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 14:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 03:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 01:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 14:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-04"}

He attended St. Jerome's High School and in January 1943 received the\nPh.B. from St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont. Jim enlisted in the US\nArmy Air Force to train and serve as a meteorologist. This took him to army\nairbases in China by the close of the war. Following discharge from the army,\nJim studied mathematics at Harvard and graduated with the M.S. in June 1947. To\nprepare for doctoral work in statistics at the University of North Carolina\nthat fall, Jim went to the University of Michigan in the summer of 1947. The\nroutine admissions' physical revealed a spot on the lung and the possibility of\ntuberculosis. This caused Jim to stay at Ann Arbor through the fall of 1947 and\nthen at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham, Massachusetts to have\nhis condition followed more closely. He was discharged from the hospital in the\nspring and started his study at Chapel Hill in the fall of 1948. There he began\nresearch in compound decision theory under Herbert Robbins.

Radio and X-ray surveys allow to investigate the\nstatistics of radio halos and unveil a bimodal behaviour of the radio\nproperties of galaxy clusters: merging clusters host radio halos and trace the\nwell known radio--X correlation, while more relaxed clusters do not host radio\nhalos and populate a region well separated from that spanned by the above\ncorrelation. This appears consistent with the hypothesis that relativistic\nelectrons can be reaccelerated by MHD turbulence generated during cluster\nmergers. In the context of this model the population of radio halos consists of\na mixture of halos with different spectral properties, most of them with very\nsteep spectrum and visible only at low radio frequencies.
