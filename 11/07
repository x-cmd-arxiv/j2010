We present a new algorithm\nfor error cause localization based on a reduction to the maximal satisfiability\nproblem (MAX-SAT), which asks what is the maximum number of clauses of a\nBoolean formula that can be simultaneously satisfied by an assignment. At an\nintuitive level, our algorithm takes as input a program and a failing test, and\ncomprises the following three steps. First, using symbolic execution, we encode\na trace of a program as a Boolean trace formula which is satisfiable iff the\ntrace is feasible. Second, for a failing program execution (e.g., one that\nviolates an assertion or a post-condition), we construct an unsatisfiable\nformula by taking the trace formula and additionally asserting that the input\nis the failing test and that the assertion condition does hold at the end.\nThird, using MAX-SAT, we find a maximal set of clauses in this formula that can\nbe satisfied together, and output the complement set as a potential cause of\nthe error. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool called bug-assist for C\nprograms. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the tool on a set of\nbenchmark examples with injected faults, and show that in most cases,\nbug-assist can quickly and precisely isolate the exact few lines of code whose\nchange eliminates the error. We also demonstrate how our algorithm can be\nmodified to automatically suggest fixes for common classes of errors such as\noff-by-one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2010 21:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 07:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

Early superhumps\ndetected during the rise to the superoutburst maximum exhibited an unusually\nlarge fractional period excess of epsilon = 0.137 (Psh = 0.0856(88) d).\nFollowing the maximum, a linear decline in brightness followed, lasting at\nleast 6 days.

The master Lagrangians turn out to be the\nNC versions of the so-called affine Toda model coupled to matter fields\n(NCATM$_{1,2}$), in which the Toda field $g$ belongs to certain subgroups of $\nGL(3)$, and the matter fields lie in the higher grading directions of an affine\nLie algebra.

The NCGMT$_{1,2}$ models correspond to Moyal product extension of the\ngeneralized massive Thirring model. The NCGMT$_{1,2}$ models posses constrained\nversions with relevant Lax pair formulations, and other sub-models such as the\nNC massive Thirring (NCMT$_{1,2}$), the NC Bukhvostov-Lipatov (NCBL$_{1,2}$)\nand constrained versions of the last models with Lax pair formulations.

Specifically, the instantaneous feedback is a function of\nan action taken by the encoder, an action taken by the decoder, and the channel\noutput. Encoder and decoder actions take values in finite alphabets, and may be\nsubject to average cost constraints. We prove capacity results for such a\nsetting by constructing a sequence of achievable rates, using a simple scheme\nbased on 'code tree' generation, that generates channel input symbols along\nwith encoder and decoder actions. We prove that the limit of this sequence\nexists. For a given block length and probability of error, we give an upper\nbound on the maximum achievable rate. Our upper and lower bounds coincide and\nhence yield the capacity for the case where the probability of initial state is\npositive for all states. Further, for stationary indecomposable channels\nwithout intersymbol interference (ISI), the capacity is given as the limit of\nnormalized directed information between the input and output sequence,\nmaximized over an appropriate set of causally conditioned distributions. As an\nimportant special case, we consider the framework of 'to feed or not to feed\nback' where either the encoder or the decoder takes binary actions, which\ndetermine whether current channel output will be fed back to the encoder, with\na constraint on the fraction of channel outputs that are fed back. As another\nspecial case of our framework, we characterize the capacity of 'coding on the\nbackward link' in FSCs, i.e. when the decoder sends limited-rate instantaneous\ncoded noise-free feedback on the backward link.

Consequently,\na piece of membrane has an area excess relative to its optically resolvable\narea, also called projected area. From a mechanical point of view, we can thus\nidentify three tensions associated to lipid membranes: the mechanical effective\ntension $\\tau$, associated to an increase in the projected area and to the\nflattening of the fluctuations; the tension $\\sigma$, associated to the\nmicroscopical area of the membrane and thus non measurable, but commonly used\nin theoretical predictions; and its macroscopical counterpart measured through\nthe fluctuation spectrum, $r$. Up to now, the equality between these quantities\nwas taken for granted when analyzing experimental data. In this dissertation,\nwe have studied, using the projected stress tensor, whether and under which\nconditions it is justified to assume $\\tau = \\sigma$. We studied three\ngeometries (planar, spherical and cylindrical) and obtained the relation $\\tau\n\\approx \\sigma - \\sigma_0$, where $\\sigma_0$ is a constant depending only on\nthe membrane's high frequency cutoff and on the temperature. Accordingly, we\nconclude that neglecting the difference between $\\tau$ and $\\sigma$ is\njustifiable only to membranes under large tensions: in the case of small\ntensions, corrections must be taken into account. We have studied the\nimplications of this result to the interpretation of experiments involving\nmembrane nanotubes.

Experiments have shown\nthat more heterogeneous microstructures exhibit up to one order of magnitude\nhigher elastic properties than their more homogeneous counterparts at equal\nvolume fraction. In this paper, packings of spherical particles are used as\nmodel structures to computationally investigate the elastic properties of\ncoagulated particle gels as a function of their degree of heterogeneity. The\ndiscrete element model comprises a linear elastic contact law, particle bonding\nand damping. The simulation parameters were calibrated using a homogeneous and\na heterogeneous microstructure originating from earlier Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. A systematic study of the elastic properties as a function of the\ndegree of heterogeneity was performed using two sets of microstructures\nobtained from Brownian dynamics simulation and from the void expansion method.\nBoth sets cover a broad and to a large extent overlapping range of degrees of\nheterogeneity. The simulations have shown that the elastic properties as a\nfunction of the degree of heterogeneity are independent of the structure\ngeneration algorithm and that the relation between the shear modulus and the\ndegree of heterogeneity can be well described by a power law. This suggests the\npresence of a critical degree of heterogeneity and, therefore, a phase\ntransition between a phase with finite and one with zero elastic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 15:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 20:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-11"}

On the basis of\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations, we argue that this outburst is of\nthe FU Orionis type. We gathered photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nthe object both in the pre-outburst state and during a phase of increase in its\nbrightness. The photometric BVRI data (Johnson-Cousins system) that we present\nwere collected from April 2009 to September 2010. To facilitate transformation\nfrom instrumental measurements to the standard system, fifteen comparison stars\nin the field of HBC 722 were calibrated in the BVRI bands. Optical spectra of\nHBC 722 were obtained with the 1.3-m telescope of Skinakas Observatory (Crete,\nGreece) and the 0.6-m telescope of Schiaparelli Observatory in Varese (Italy).\nThe pre-outburst photometric and spectroscopic observations of HBC 722 show\nboth low amplitude photometric variations and an emission-line spectrum typical\nof T Tau stars. The observed outburst started before May 2010 and reached its\nmaximum brightness in September 2010, with a recorded Delta V~4.7 mag.\namplitude. Simultaneously with the increase in brightness the color indices\nchanged significantly and the star became appreciably bluer. The light curve of\nHBC 722 during the period of rise in brightness is similar to the light curves\nof the classical FUors - FU Ori and V1057 Cyg. The spectral observations during\nthe time of increase in brightness showed significant changes in both the\nprofiles and intensity of the spectral lines. Only H alpha remained in\nemission, while the H beta, Na I 5890/5896, Mg I triplet 5174, and Ba II\n5854/6497 lines were in strong absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 15:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
