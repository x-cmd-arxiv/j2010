Here, it is argued that **bipartite** entanglement measures provide key\ninformation on out-of-equilibrium states and might therefore offer stringent\nthermalization criteria. This is illustrated by considering a global quench in\nan (extended) XXZ spin-1/2 chain across its (zero-temperature) quantum critical\npoint. A non-local **bipartition** of the chain **preserving translation\nsymmetry** is proposed.

Inspired by sequential complexity theory, we\nfocus on a complexity theory for distributed decision problems. In the context\nof locality, solving a decision problem requires the processors to\nindependently inspect their local neighborhoods and then collectively decide\nwhether a given global input instance belongs to some specified language. This\npaper introduces several classes of distributed decision problems, proves\nseparation among them and presents some complete problems. More specifically,\nwe consider the standard LOCAL model of computation and define LD (for local\ndecision) as the class of decision problems that can be solved in constant\nnumber of communication rounds. We first study the intriguing question of\nwhether randomization helps in local distributed computing, and to what extent.\nSpecifically, we define the corresponding randomized class BPLD, and ask\nwhether LD=BPLD. We provide a partial answer to this question by showing that\nin many cases, randomization does not help for deciding hereditary languages.\nIn addition, we define the notion of local many-one reductions, and introduce\nthe (nondeterministic) class NLD of decision problems for which there exists a\ncertificate that can be verified in constant number of communication rounds.

For models that are not linear Gaussian or possess finite state\nspace, smoothing distributions are in general infeasible to compute as they\ninvolve intergrals over a space of dimensionality at least equal to the number\nof observations. Recent years have seen an increased interest in Monte\nCarlo-based methods for smoothing, often involving particle filters. One such\nmethod is to approximate filter distributions with a particle filter, and then\nto simulate backwards on the trellis of particles using a backward kernel. We\nshow that by supplementing this procedure with a Metropolis-Hastings step\ndeciding whether to accept a proposed trajectory or not, one obtains a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo scheme whose stationary distribution is the exact smoothing\ndistribution. We also show that in this procedure, backward sampling can be\nreplaced by backward smoothing, which effectively means averaging over all\npossible trajectories. In an example we compare these approaches to a similar\none recently proposed by Andrieu, Doucet and Holenstein, and show that the new\nmethods can be more efficient in terms of precision (inverse variance) per\ncomputation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 17:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-10"}

These companions\nprovide insight into the extreme case of companion formation (either binary or\nplanetary), and due to their relative ease of observation when compared to\nclose companions, they offer a useful template for our expectations of more\ntypical planets. We present the results from an adaptive optics imaging survey\nfor wide (50-500 AU) companions to solar type stars in Upper Scorpius. We\nreport one new discovery of a ~14 M_J companion around GSC 06214-00210, and\nconfirm that the candidate planetary mass companion 1RXS J160929.1-210524\ndetected by Lafreniere et al (2008) is in fact co-moving with its primary star.\nIn our survey, these two detections correspond to ~4% of solar type stars\nhaving companions in the 6-20 M_J mass and 200-500 AU separation range.

The (WDM) corrections are obtained in a perturbative expansion\nvalid in the range of redshifts at which N-body simulations set up initial\nconditions, and for a wide range of scales. The redshift dependence is\ndetermined by the kurtosis $\\beta_2$ of the distribution function at\ndecoupling. At large redshift there is an enhancement of peculiar velocities\nfor $\\beta_2 > 1$ that contributes to free streaming and leads to further\nsuppression of the matter power spectrum and an enhancement of the peculiar\nvelocity autocorrelation function at scales smaller than the free streaming\nscale. Statistical fluctuations of peculiar velocities are also suppressed on\nthese scales by the same effect. In the linearized approximation, the coarse\ngrained phase space density features redshift dependent (WDM) corrections from\ngravitational perturbations determined by the power spectrum of density\nperturbations and $\\beta_2$.

The\nnetwork is recursively partitioned into subnetworks. Initially, nodes at the\nfinest scale gossip to compute local averages. Then, using geographic routing\nto enable gossip between nodes that are not directly connected, these local\naverages are progressively fused up the hierarchy until the global average is\ncomputed. We show that the proposed hierarchical scheme with $k$ levels of\nhierarchy is competitive with state-of-the-art randomized gossip algorithms, in\nterms of message complexity, achieving $\\epsilon$-accuracy with high\nprobability after $O\\big(n \\log \\log n \\log \\frac{kn}{\\epsilon} \\big)$\nmessages. Key to our analysis is the way in which the network is recursively\npartitioned. We find that the optimal scaling law is achieved when subnetworks\nat scale $j$ contain $O(n^{(2/3)^j})$ nodes; then the message complexity at any\nindividual scale is $O(n \\log \\frac{kn}{\\epsilon})$, and the total number of\nscales in the hierarchy grows slowly, as $\\Theta(\\log \\log n)$. Another\nimportant consequence of hierarchical construction is that the longest distance\nover which messages are exchanged is $O(n^{1/3})$ hops (at the highest scale),\nand most messages (at lower scales) travel shorter distances. In networks that\nuse link-level acknowledgements, this results in less congestion and resource\nusage by reducing message retransmissions. Simulations illustrate that the\nproposed scheme is more message-efficient than existing state-of-the-art\nrandomized gossip algorithms based on averaging along paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 23:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 21:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 21:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

Here we report the detection of continuum emission at\nsub-arcsec/arcsec resolution with the Submillimeter Array at 1.36mm and\n456microns, respectively. We detected dust emission arising from two compact\ncores, MM1 and MM2, separated by about 7\" (~12000AU in projected distance). MM1\nspatially coincides with the powerful thermal radio continuum jet that powers\nthe very extended molecular outflow, while MM2 is associated with the protostar\nthat drives the compact molecular outflow recently found in this region.\n  High angular resolution obervations at 1.36mm show that MM1 is unresolved and\nthat MM2 splits into two subcomponents separated by ~1\". The mass of MM1 is\nabout 4Msun and it has a size of <300AU. This is consistent with MM1 being\nassociated with a massive and dense (n(H2)>10^9cm-3) circumstellar dusty disk\nsurrounding a high-mass protostar, which has not developed yet a compact HII\nregion. On the other hand, the masses of the two separate components of MM2 are\nabout 2Msun each. One of these components is a compact core with an\nintermediate-mass young protostar inside and the other component is probably a\npre-stellar core.\n  MM1 is the brigthest source at 1.36mm, while MM2 dominates the emission at\n456microns. These are the only (sub)millimeter sources detected in the SMA\nobservations. Hence, it seems that both sources may contribute significantly to\nthe bolometric luminosity of the region. Finally, we argue that the\ncharacteristics of these two sources indicate that MM2 is probably in an\nearlier evolutionary stage than MM1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 23:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between L_UV and\nemission line EQW (the Baldwin Effect) and the \"blueshifting\" of\nhigh-ionization emission lines. The blueshift of the CIV emission line is\nnearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (RQ) quasars\nand 360 km/s for radio-loud (RL) quasars, and the Baldwin Effect is present in\nboth RQ and RL samples. Composite spectra are constructed as a function of CIV\nemission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships between\ndifferent line species and the SED. Within a two-component disk+wind model of\nthe broad emission line region (BELR), where the wind filters the continuum\nseen by the disk component, we find that RL quasars are consistent with being\ndominated by the disk component, while BALQSOs are consistent with being\ndominated by the wind component. Some RQ objects have emission line features\nsimilar to RL quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (BH) spin\nto form radio jets.

However, it is\npossible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of BELR\nparameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars\n(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the SED, which\nultimately must be tied to BH mass and accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 06:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 16:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

All the compositions show\nferromagnetic/metal to paramagnetic/insulator transition except the Pb doped\nsample which is insulating and ferromagnetic in the entire temperature range.\nThe simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in Pb\ndoped compound is most likely due to the presence of FM clusters separated by\nFe and Mn ions that are coupled AFM and hence prevent the current from crossing\nthe inter-domain region. The magnetization and Tc are decreased by decreasing\nthe Cation size on La site. We observed that (for a fixed Fe content of 5%) the\ntransition temperature and magnetic moment at 77 K is a maximum for Sr doped\nsample and is decreasing if we increase or decrease the cation size from Sr\nsize. The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most\nlikely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other\ndopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic\nmoment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size\nmismatch of the A site cations. This deviation leads to weakening of the FM\ndouble exchange (DE). We observed a spin freezing type effect in the Pb doped\nsample below 120 K in resistivity, AC susceptibility and in magnetization. This\nsuggests that the AFM interactions introduced by the Fe are most effective in\nthe Pb doped composition leading to increased competition between the FM and\nAFM interactions.

These studies will be limited not by raw\nsensitivity to the signal, but rather, by bright foreground radiation from\nGalactic and extragalactic radio sources and the Galactic continuum. In\naddition, leakage due to gain errors and non-ideal feeds conspire to further\ncontaminate low-frequency radio obsevations. This leakage leads to a portion of\nthe complex linear polarisation signal finding its way into Stokes I, and\ninhibits the detection of the non-polarised cosmological signal from the epoch\nof reionisation. In this work, we show that rotation measure synthesis can be\nused to recover the signature of cosmic hydrogen reionisation in the presence\nof contamination by polarised foregrounds. To achieve this, we apply the\nrotation measure synthesis technique to the Stokes I component of a synthetic\ndata cube containing Galactic foreground emission, the effect of instrumental\npolarisation leakage, and redshifted 21-cm emission by neutral hydrogen from\nthe epoch of reionisation. This produces an effective Stokes I Faraday\ndispersion function for each line of sight, from which instrumental\npolarisation leakage can be fitted and subtracted.

With our CO millimeter\nobservations, we find that the molecular clouds (MCs) at V(LSR)~84km/s can\nbetter explain the multiwavelength properties of the remnant than the\nV(LSR)=67-72km/s MCs that are suggested by Lee et al. (2009). At around 84km/s,\nthe western boundary of the SNR is perfectly confined by the western molecular\nwall. The CO emission fades out from west to east, indicating that the eastern\nregion is of low gas density. In particular, an intruding finger/pillar-like\nMC, which may be shocked at the tip, can well explain the X-ray and radio\nenhancement in the southwest and some infrared filaments there. The SNR-MC\ninteraction is also favored by the relatively elevated 12CO J=2-1/J=1-0 line\nratios in the southwestern \"pillar tip\" and the molecular patch on the\nnorthwestern boundary. The redshifted 12CO (J=1-0 and J=2-1) wings (86-90km/s)\nof an eastern 81km/s molecular patch may be the kinematic evidence for shock-MC\ninteraction.

However, regenerating codes possess in\naddition, the ability to repair a failed node by connecting to an arbitrary\nsubset of d nodes. It has been shown that for the case of functional-repair,\nthere is a tradeoff between the amount of data stored per node and the\nbandwidth required to repair a failed node. A special case of functional-repair\nis exact-repair where the replacement node is required to store data identical\nto that in the failed node. Exact-repair is of interest as it greatly\nsimplifies system implementation. The first result of the paper is an explicit,\nexact-repair code for the point on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff corresponding\nto the minimum possible repair bandwidth, for the case when d=n-1.

Hence the term `repair-by-transfer'. The\nsecond result of this paper shows that the interior points on the\nstorage-bandwidth tradeoff cannot be achieved under exact-repair, thus pointing\nto the existence of a separate tradeoff under exact-repair. Specifically, we\nidentify a set of scenarios, termed `helper node pooling', and show that it is\nthe necessity to satisfy such scenarios that over-constrains the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 12:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 11:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Their\nasymptotic normality is established. The finite sample property is demonstrated\nby simulation studies. The estimators also improve the power of the tests for\ndetecting statistically differentially expressed genes. The methodology is\nillustrated by the data from microarray quality control (MAQC) project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 12:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

The generator\nof this master equation is derived order by order in the hybridization between\ndot and leads. Although the generator turns out to be closely related to the\nT-matrix expressions for the transition rates, which are plagued by\ndivergences, in the time-convolutionless generator all divergences cancel order\nby order. The time-convolutionless and T-matrix master equations are contrasted\nto the Nakajima-Zwanzig version. The absence of divergences in the\nNakajima-Zwanzig master equation due to the nonexistence of secular reducible\ncontributions becomes rather transparent in our approach, which explicitly\nprojects out these contributions.

Their nature is unclear and\ndifficult to investigate since they are only visible in the radio.\nHigh-resolution radio images and comprehensive spectral coverage can yield\nconstraints on the emission mechanisms of IFRS and can give hints to\nsimilarities with known objects. We imaged a sample of 17 IFRS at 4.8GHz and\n8.6GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array to determine the structures\non arcsecond scales. We added radio data from other observing projects and from\nthe literature to obtain broad-band radio spectra. We find that the sources in\nour sample are either resolved out at the higher frequencies or are compact at\nresolutions of a few arcsec, which implies that they are smaller than a typical\ngalaxy. The spectra of IFRS are remarkably steep, with a median spectral index\nof -1.4 and a prominent lack of spectral indices larger than -0.7. We also find\nthat, given the IR non-detections, the ratio of 1.4GHz flux density to 3.6um\nflux density is very high, and this puts them into the same regime as\nhigh-redshift radio galaxies. The evidence that IFRS are predominantly\nhigh-redshift sources driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is strong, even\nthough not all IFRS may be caused by the same phenomenon. Compared to the rare\nand painstakingly collected high-redshift radio galaxies, IFRS appear to be\nmuch more abundant, but less luminous, AGN-driven galaxies at similar\ncosmological distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 14:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The latter are semiflexible in the meaning that static\nintrachain correlations are strongly non-gaussian at all length scales. The\ndynamic asymmetry in the blend is strongly enhanced by decreasing temperature,\ninducing confinement effects on the fast component. The dynamics of the Rouse\nmodes show very different trends for the two models of the fast component. For\nthe fully-flexible case, the relaxation times exhibit a progressive deviation\nfrom Rouse scaling on increasing the dynamic asymmetry. This anomalous effect\nhas a dynamic origin.

On the\ncontrary, in the semiflexible case the relaxation times exhibit approximately\nthe same scaling behaviour as the amplitudes of the modes.

Observations\nhave so far been unable to confirm the presence of planets caught in formation.\nWe have developed a novel method to detect a giant planet still embedded in a\ncircumstellar disk by the distortions of the CO molecular line profiles\nemerging from the protoplanetary disk's surface. The method is based on the\nfact that a giant planet significantly perturbs the gas velocity flow in\naddition to distorting the disk surface density. We have calculated the\nemerging molecular line profiles by combining hydrodynamical models with\nsemianalytic radiative transfer calculations. Our results have shown that a\ngiant Jupiter-like planet can be detected using contemporary or future\nhigh-resolution near-IR spectrographs such as VLT/CRIRES or ELT/METIS. We have\nalso studied the effects of binarity on disk perturbations. The most\ninteresting results have been found for eccentric circumprimary disks in\nmid-separation binaries, for which the disk eccentricity - detectable from the\nasymmetric line profiles - arises from the gravitational effects of the\ncompanion star. Our detailed simulations shed new light on how to constrain the\ndisk kinematical state as well as its eccentricity profile. Recent findings by\nindependent groups have shown that core-accretion is severely affected by disk\neccentricity, hence detection of an eccentric protoplanetary disk in a young\nbinary system would further constrain planet formation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 15:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 17:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
