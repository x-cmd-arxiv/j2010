These models typically involve many free\nparameters whose determination is a substantial obstacle to model development.\nDirect measurement of biochemical parameters in vivo is often difficult and\nsometimes impracticable, while fitting them under data-poor conditions may\nresult in biologically implausible values.\n  Results: We discuss different methodological approaches to estimate\nparameters in complex biological models. We make use of the high computational\npower of the Blue Gene technology to perform an extensive study of the\nparameter space in a model of avascular tumor growth. We explicitly show that\nthe landscape of the cost function used to optimize the model to the data has a\nvery rugged surface in parameter space. This cost function has many local\nminima with unrealistic solutions, including the global minimum corresponding\nto the best fit.\n  Conclusions: The case studied in this paper shows one example in which model\nparameters that optimally fit the data are not necessarily the best ones from a\nbiological point of view. To avoid force-fitting a model to a dataset, we\npropose that the best model parameters should be found by choosing, among\nsuboptimal parameters, those that match criteria other than the ones used to\nfit the model. We also conclude that the model, data and optimization approach\nform a new complex system, and point to the need of a theory that addresses\nthis problem more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 17:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

The possibility now exists\nexperimentally to exploit these high momentum particles to uniquely probe the\nunprecedented state of matter produced in heavy ion collisions. At the same\ntime naive theoretical expectations have been dashed by data.\n  The first puzzle we confront is that of the enormous intermediate-pT\nazimuthal anisotropy, or v2, of jets observed at RHIC. The second puzzle is the\nsurprisingly similar suppression of light mesons and nonphotonic electrons,\nwhich precludes perturbative predictions predicated on gluon bremsstrahlung\nradiation as the dominant energy loss channel. Near qualitative agreement\nresults from including collisional energy loss and integrating over the\nfluctuating jet pathlengths. Another conjecture for heavy quark energy loss\ncomes via explicit construction using the AdS/CFT correspondence; the momentum\nloss of a hanging dragging string moving through the deconfined plasma leads to\nqualitative agreement with heavy quark decay data. We propose a robust test to\nexperimentally differentiate these two competing ideas: the ratio of charm to\nbottom suppression rapidly approaches 1 for pQCD but is independent of momentum\nand well below 1 for AdS/CFT.

The conditional probability distribution is defined for the set\nof microstates associated with the set of phase space paths determined by\nsolutions of Hamilton's equations.

A\ngeneral problem is how to produce binaries with semi-major axes small enough to\nin significantly less than the Hubble time (t_H), and thus accommodate the\nobservation that these events closely follow episodes of star formation. I\nexplore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually\ncoeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai\noscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing\nits gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly\nincreases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is\nt_merge < t_H. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can\nmerge in < t_H if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough\ninclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that t_merge < t_H\nis yet larger. In contrast, P < 0.3 days is required in the absence of a\ntertiary. I discuss implications of these findings for the production of\ntransients formed via compact object binary mergers. Based on the statistics of\nsolar-type binaries, I argue that many such binaries should be in triple\nsystems affected by the Kozai resonance. If true, expectations for the mHz GW\nsignal from individual sources, the diffuse background, and the foreground for\nGW experiments like LISA are modified.

The persistent recurrence of such economic crises calls for an\nunderstanding of their generic features rather than treating them as singular\nevents. The global economic system is a highly complex system and can best be\nviewed in terms of a network of interacting macroeconomic agents. In this\nregard, from the perspective of collective network dynamics, here we explore\nhow the topology of global macroeconomic network affects the patterns of\nspreading of economic crises. Using a simple toy model of crisis spreading, we\ndemonstrate that an individual country's role in crisis spreading is not only\ndependent on its gross macroeconomic capacities, but also on its local and\nglobal connectivity profile in the context of the world economic network. We\nfind that on one hand clustering of weak links at the regional scale can\nsignificantly aggravate the spread of crises, but on the other hand the current\nnetwork structure at the global scale harbors a higher tolerance of extreme\ncrises compared to more \"globalized\" random networks. These results suggest\nthat there can be a potential hidden cost in the ongoing globalization movement\ntowards establishing less-constrained, trans-regional economic links between\ncountries, by increasing the vulnerability of global economic system to extreme\ncrises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 03:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 00:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-14"}

In most scenarios, the choice model, which can effectively be\nviewed as a distribution over permutations, must be learned from observed data.\nThe observed data, in turn, may frequently be viewed as (partial, noisy)\ninformation about marginals of this distribution over permutations. As such,\nthe search for an appropriate choice model boils down to learning a\ndistribution over permutations that is (near-)consistent with observed\ninformation about this distribution.\n  In this work, we pursue a non-parametric approach which seeks to learn a\nchoice model (i.e. a distribution over permutations) with {\\em sparsest}\npossible support, and consistent with observed data. We assume that the data\nobserved consists of noisy information pertaining to the marginals of the\nchoice model we seek to learn. We establish that {\\em any} choice model admits\na `very' sparse approximation in the sense that there exists a choice model\nwhose support is small relative to the dimension of the observed data and whose\nmarginals approximately agree with the observed marginal information. We\nfurther show that under, what we dub, `signature' conditions, such a sparse\napproximation can be found in a computationally efficiently fashion relative to\na brute force approach. An empirical study using the American Psychological\nAssociation election data-set suggests that our approach manages to unearth\nuseful structural properties of the underlying choice model using the sparse\napproximation found. Our results further suggest that the signature condition\nis a potential alternative to the recently popularized Restricted Null Space\ncondition for efficient recovery of sparse models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 03:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2011 07:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}

Dynamic Magic Sets (DMS) are an extension of this technique, which\nhas been proved to be sound and complete for query answering over ASP programs\nwith stratified negation.\n  A distinguishing feature of DMS is that the optimization can be exploited\nalso during the nondeterministic phase of ASP engines.

Below the Fermi level the minority spin highest valence states are found\nto localize more on the GaAs layers while lowest conduction states have a\nmany-body origin. Our results, therefore, suggest that in these\nheterostructures holes and electrons remain separated among different layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 10:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A set of high quality time-series data on nine targets has been\nobtained in 3 photometric bands (Sloan u', g', r') using ULTRACAM at the VLT\nwith a typical time resolution of a few tens of ms. Such high resolution is\nrequired because theory predicts very short periods, of the order of a second,\nfor the p-modes in white dwarfs. The data have been analyzed using Fourier\ntransform and correlation analysis methods. Results: P-modes have not been\ndetected in any of our targets. The upper limits obtained for the pulsation\namplitude, typically less than 0.1%, are the smallest limits reported in the\nliterature. The Nyquist frequencies are large enough to fully cover the\nfrequency range of interest for the p-modes. For the brightest target of our\nsample, G 185-32, a p-mode oscillation with a relative amplitude of 5x10**(-4)\nwould have been easily detected, as shown by a simple simulation. For G 185-32\nwe note an excess of power below ~2 Hz in all the three nights of observation,\nwhich might be due in principle to tens of low-amplitude close modes. However,\nneither correlation analysis nor Fourier transform of the amplitude spectrum\nshow significant results. We also checked the possibility that the p-modes have\na very short lifetime, shorter than the observing runs, by dividing each run in\nseveral subsets and analyzing these subsets independently.

For the first time we utilize a\ncomprehensive model of dust evolution which includes growth, fragmentation and\nsedimentation. Specific attention is paid to the influence of grain evolution\non the penetration of the UV field in the disk. A chemical model that includes\na comprehensive set of gas phase and grain surface chemical reactions is used\nto simulate the chemical structure of the disk. The main effect of the grain\nevolution on the disk chemical composition comes from sedimentation, and, to a\nlesser degree, from the reduction of the total grain surface area. The net\neffect of grain growth is suppressed by the fragmentation process which\nmaintains a population of small grains, dominating the total grain surface\narea. We consider three models of dust properties. In model GS both growth and\nsedimentation are taken into account. In models A5 and A4 all grains are\nassumed to have the same size (10(-5) cm and 10(-4) cm, respectively) with\nconstant gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100. Like in previous studies, the\n\"three-layer\" pattern (midplane, molecular layer, hot atmosphere) in the disk\nchemical structure is preserved in all models, but shifted closer to the\nmidplane in models with increased grain size (GS and A4).

This strategy is worked out in detail\nin the case of a homogeneous cosmology, in the context of both a conventional\nSchrodinger quantization scheme, and a `polymer' quantization scheme of the\nkind inspired by loop quantum gravity. Particular attention is given to\nlimitations placed on the observability of time evolution by the requirement\nthat a test clock should contribute only a negligible energy to the Hamiltonian\nconstraint. It is found that suitable compromises are available, in which the\nclock energy is reasonably small, while Dirac observables are reasonably\nsharply defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 15:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 11:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

We investigate the effect of such a\nnon-Poissonian nature of human behavior on dynamics of opinion formation. We\nuse a variant of the voter model and numerically compare the time to consensus\nof all the voters with different distributions of interevent intervals and\ndifferent networks. Compared with the exponential distribution of interevent\nintervals (i.e., the standard voter model), the power-law distribution of\ninterevent intervals slows down consensus on the ring. This is because of the\nmemory effect; in the power-law case, the expected time until the next update\nevent on a link is large if the link has not had an update event for a long\ntime. On the complete graph, the consensus time in the power-law case is close\nto that in the exponential case. Regular graphs bridge these two results such\nthat the slowing down of the consensus in the power-law case as compared to the\nexponential case is less pronounced as the degree increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 15:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 05:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

We show that effective entanglement is always reduced by\nrestricting measurements. We define effective entanglement as the least amount\nof entanglement necessary to play all semiquantum nonlocal games at least as\nwell with unrestricted measurements as with the more entangled original state\nand restricted measurements.

Here we focus on another effect\nof quantum confinement in superconducting grains that was not studied\npreviously, i.e., spatially nonuniform pairing. This effect is very significant\nwhen single-electron levels form bunches and/or a kind of shell structure: in\nhighly symmetric grains the order parameter can exhibit variations with\nposition by an order of magnitude. Nonuniform pairing is closely related to a\nquantum-confinement induced modification of the pairing-interaction matrix\nelements and size-dependent pinning of the chemical potential to groups of\ndegenerate or nearly degenerate levels. For illustration we consider spherical\nmetallic nanograins. We show that the relevant matrix elements are as a rule\nenhanced in the presence of quantum confinement, which favors spatial\nvariations of the order parameter, compensating the corresponding energy cost.\nThe size-dependent pinning of the chemical potential further increases the\nspatial variation of the pair condensate. The role of nonuniform pairing is\nsmaller in less symmetric confining geometries and/or in the presence of\ndisorder.
