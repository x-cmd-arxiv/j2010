Statistical models play an important role in improving\nknowledge of this complex spatio-temporal phenomenon and in supporting public\nagencies and policy makers. We focus on the class of hierarchical models that\nprovides a flexible framework for incorporating spatio-temporal interactions at\ndifferent hierarchical levels. The challenge is to choose a model that is\nsatisfactory in terms of goodness of fit, interpretability, parsimoniousness,\nprediction capability and computational costs. In order to support this choice,\nwe propose a comparison approach based on a set of criteria summarized in a\ntable that can be easily communicated to non-statisticians.

The analysis of SNRs images collected in different energy bands requires\nthe support of theoretical modeling of synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\nemission. We develop a numerical code (REMLIGHT) to synthesize, from MHD\nsimulations, the synchrotron radio, X-ray and IC gamma-ray emission from SNRs\nexpanding in non-uniform interstellar medium (ISM) and/or non-uniform\ninterstellar magnetic field (ISMF). As a first application, the code is used to\ninvestigate the effects of non-uniform ISMF on the SNR morphology in the\nnon-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We perform 3D MHD simulations of a\nspherical SNR shock expanding through a magnetized ISM with a gradient of\nambient magnetic field strength. The model includes an approximate treatment of\nupstream magnetic field amplification and the effect of shock modification due\nto back reaction of accelerated cosmic rays. From the simulations, we\nsynthesize the synchrotron radio, X-ray and IC gamma-ray emission with\nREMLIGHT, making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and\ninjection of relativistic electrons. A gradient of the ambient magnetic field\nstrength induces asymmetric morphologies in radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands\nindependently from the model of electron injection if the gradient has a\ncomponent perpendicular to the line-of-sight. The degree of asymmetry of the\nremnant morphology depends on the details of the electron injection and\nacceleration and is different in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. The\nnon-thermal X-ray morphology is the most sensitive to the gradient, showing the\nhighest degree of asymmetry. The IC gamma-ray emission is weakly sensitive to\nthe non-uniform ISMF, the degree of asymmetry of the SNR morphology being the\nlowest in this band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 16:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It comprises previously published data for 19 objects (Mieske et al.\n2008) which we re-analysed, including 13 with available HST photometric data.\nUsing Virtual Observatory technologies we found archival HST images for two\nmore UCDs and then determined their structural properties. For all objects we\nderived internal velocity dispersions, stellar population parameters, and\nstellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L)* by fitting individual simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) synthetic spectra convolved with a Gaussian against the\nobserved spectra using the NBursts full spectral fitting technique. For 14\nobjects we estimated dynamical masses suggesting no dark matter (DM) in 12 of\nthem and no more than 40 per cent DM mass fraction in the remaining two, in\ncontrast to findings for several UCDs in the Virgo cluster. Some Fornax UCDs\neven have too high values of (M/L)* estimated using the Kroupa stellar initial\nmass function (IMF) resulting in negative formally computed DM mass fractions.\nThe objects with too high (M/L)* ratios compared to the dynamical ones have\nrelatively short dynamical relaxation timescales, close to the Hubble time or\nbelow. We therefore suggest that their lower dynamical ratios (M/L)dyn are\ncaused by low-mass star depletion due to dynamical evolution. Overall, the\nobserved UCD characteristics suggest at least two formation channels: tidal\nthreshing of nucleated dwarf galaxies for massive UCDs (~10^8 M_sun), and a\nclassical scenario of red globular cluster formation for lower-mass UCDs (<\n10^7 M_sun).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 17:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

On\nthe other hand a mixed state, i.e. a statistical density matrix, is the\nstandard formalism to account for thermal equilibrium, as postulated in the\nmicrocanonical quantum statistics. In the present paper an alternative\ntreatment relying on a statistical analysis of the possible wavefunctions of an\nisolated system is presented. In analogy with the classical ergodic theory, the\ntime evolution of the wavefunction determines the probability distribution in\nthe phase space pertaining to an isolated system. However, this alone cannot\naccount for a well defined thermodynamical description of the system in the\nmacroscopic limit, unless a suitable probability distribution for the quantum\nconstants of motion is introduced. We present a workable formalism assuring the\nemergence of typical values of thermodynamic functions, such as the internal\nenergy and the entropy, in the large size limit of the system. This allows the\nidentification of macroscopic properties independently of the specific\nrealization of the quantum state. A description of material systems in\nagreement with equilibrium thermodynamics is then derived without constraints\non the physical constituents and interactions of the system. Furthermore, the\ncanonical statistics is recovered in all generality for the reduced density\nmatrix of a subsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 18:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 14:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-17"}

The digital halftoning is a sort of image processing,\nnamely, representing each grayscale in terms of black and white binary dots.\nThe digital halftoning is achieved by making use of the threshold mask, namely,\nfor each pixel, the halftoned binary pixel is determined as black if the\noriginal grayscale pixel is greater than or equal to the mask value and is\ndetermined as white vice versa. To determine the optimal value of the mask on\neach pixel for a given original grayscale image, we first assume that the\nhuman-eyes might recognize the black and white binary halftoned image as the\ncorresponding grayscale one by linear filters. The Hamiltonian is constructed\nas a distance between the original and the recognized images which is written\nin terms of the threshold mask. We are confirmed that the system described by\nthe Hamiltonian is regarded as a kind of antiferromagnetic Ising model with\nquenched disorders. By searching the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we obtain\nthe optimal threshold mask and the resulting halftoned binary dots\nsimultaneously. From the power-spectrum analysis, we find that the binary dots\nimage is physiologically plausible from the view point of human-eyes modulation\nproperties. We also propose a theoretical framework to investigate statistical\nperformance of inverse digital halftoning, that is, the inverse process of\nhalftoning. From the Bayesian inference view point, we rigorously show that the\nBayes-optimal inverse-halftoning is achieved on a specific condition which is\nvery similar to the so-called Nishimori line in the research field of spin\nglasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 19:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09"}

Elementary excitations of the system are found to be of two\ntypes - Vortex (V) and Quasi Polar (QP). DF decreases temperature of the local\nQP phase transition. The local phase transition temperature is found to be\nlower (higher) for Vortex than for QP excitations for the case of small (large)\nsize PNR. Therefore both QP and Vortex condensations are possible.\nDepolarization field hasn't effect on the Vortex scattering. For the case of QP\nscattering DF effect is essential especially in the case when total angular\nmomentum j=1. Vortex and QP (at j \\geq 2) cross section of scattering {\\Sigma}\nare nullified at the small value of momentum q of the incident wave.

Dynamical\ndecoupling is a particularly promising approach that complements conventional\nquantum error correction by eliminating some correlated errors without the\noverhead of additional qubits. In practice, the control pulses used for\ndecoupling are imperfect and thus introduce errors which can accumulate after\nmany pulses. These instrumental errors can destroy the quantum state. Here we\nexamine several dynamical decoupling sequences, and their concatenated\nvariants, using electron spin resonance of donor electron spins in a $^{28}$Si\ncrystal.

We further find that concatenated sequences\nperform better than the periodic variants, maintaining near 100% fidelities for\nspin states even after several hundred control pulses.

We compile samples of elliptical\nand disc galaxies that have Chandra and XMM-Newton measurements, and compare\nthe scaling of the coronal X-ray luminosity (L_X) with both the K-band\nluminosity (L_K) and the coronal X-ray temperature (T_X). The X-ray flux\nmeasurements are corrected for non-thermal point source contamination by\nspatial excision and spectral subtraction for resolved and unresolved sources\nrespectively. We find that the properties of the extended X-ray emission from\ngalaxies of different morphological types are similar: for both elliptical and\ndisc galaxies, the L_X - L_K and L_X - T_X relations have similar slope,\nnormalisation and scatter. The observed universality of coronal X-ray\nproperties suggests that the bulk of this emission originates from gas that has\nbeen accreted, shock-heated and compressed during the assembly of the galaxy\nand that outflows triggered by stellar processes make only a minor contribution\nto the X-ray emission. This reservoir of cooling gas is a potential source of\nmorphological transformation; it provides a fresh supply of material for discs\nto grow around galaxies of all morphological types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-10"}

Atomic diffusion in the presence\nof weak mass loss can explain the observed abundance anomalies of\npre-main-sequence stars, as well as the presence of binary systems with metal\nrich primaries and chemically normal secondaries such as V380 Ori and HD72106.\nThis is in contrast to turbulence models which do not allow for abundance\nanomalies to develop on the pre-main-sequence. The age at which anomalies can\nappear depends on stellar mass. For A and F stars, the effects of atomic\ndiffusion can modify both the internal and surface abundances before the onset\nof the MS.

The dominant source of the systematics for all ground based telescopes\nis the spatial correlation of the PSF modulated by both atmospheric turbulence\nand optical aberrations. In this paper, we present a full FOV simulation of the\nLSST images by modeling both the atmosphere and the telescope optics with the\nmost current data for the telescope specifications and the environment. To\nsimulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, we generated six-layer phase\nscreens with the parameters estimated from the on-site measurements. For the\noptics, we combined the ray-tracing tool ZEMAX and our simulated focal plane\ndata to introduce realistic aberrations and focal plane height fluctuations.\nAlthough this expected flatness deviation for LSST is small compared with that\nof other existing cameras, the fast f-ratio of the LSST optics makes this focal\nplane flatness variation and the resulting PSF discontinuities across the CCD\nboundaries significant challenges in our removal of the systematics. We resolve\nthis complication by performing PCA CCD-by-CCD, and interpolating the basis\nfunctions using conventional polynomials. We demonstrate that this PSF\ncorrection scheme reduces the residual PSF ellipticity correlation below 10^-7\nover the cosmologically interesting scale. From a null test using HST/UDF\ngalaxy images without input shear, we verify that the amplitude of the galaxy\nellipticity correlation function, after the PSF correction, is consistent with\nthe shot noise set by the finite number of objects. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe current optical design and specification for the accuracy in the focal\nplane assembly are sufficient to enable the control of the PSF systematics\nrequired for weak-lensing science with the LSST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 21:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 23:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 19:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It is based\non locating multi-stream flows, i.e. the places where the velocity field is\nmulti-valued. The method is local in Eulerian space, simple and computaionally\nefficient. This technique uses the velocities of particles and thus takes into\naccount the dynamical information. This is in contrast with the majority of\nstandard methods that use the coordinates of particles only. Two quantities are\ncomputed in every mesh cell: the mean and variance of the velocity field. In\nthe cells where the velocity is single-valued the variance must be equal to\nzero exactly, therefore the cells with non-zero variance are identified as\nmulti-stream flows. The technique has been tested in a N-body simulation of the\n\\L CDM model. The preliminary analysis has shown that numerical noise does not\npose a significant problem. The web identified by the new method has been\ncompared with the web identified by the standard technique using only the\nparticle coordinates. The comparison has shown overall similarity of two webs\nas expected, however they by no means are identical. For example, the\nisocontours of the corresponding fields have significantly different shapes and\nsome density peaks of similar heights exhibit significant differences in the\nvelocity variance and vice versa. This suggest that the density and velocity\nvariance have a significant degree of independence. The shape of the\ntwo-dimensional pdf of density and velocity variance confirms this proposition.\nThus, we conclude that the dynamical information probed by this technique\nintroduces an additional dimension into analysis of the web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 21:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 23:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The resulting\namplitude is unitary as a matter of course and it is gauge invariant, i.e., it\nsatisfies a generalized Ward-Takahashi identity. The novel feature of this\napproach is the consistent microscopic implementation of local gauge invariance\nacross all interaction mechanisms of the hadronic systems, thus serving as a\nconstraint for all subprocesses. The formalism is quite readily adapted to\napproximations and thus can be applied even in cases where the microscopic\ndynamical structure of the underlying interacting hadronic systems is either\nnot known in detail or too complex to be treated in detail. We point out how\nthe interaction currents resulting from the photon being attached to\nnucleon-nucleon-meson vertices can be treated by phenomenological four-point\ncontact currents that preserve gauge invariance. In an advance application of\nthe present formalism [K. Nakayama and H. Haberzettl, PRC 80, 051001(R)\n(2009)], such interaction currents were found to contribute significantly in\nexplaining experimental data. In addition, we provide a scheme that permits the\napproximate treatment of current contributions resulting from pieces of the NN\ninteraction that cannot be incorporated exactly. In each case, the\napproximation procedure ensures gauge invariance of the entire bremsstrahlung\namplitude. We also discuss the necessary modifications when taking into account\nbaryonic states other than the nucleon N; in detail, we consider the\n$Delta(1232)$ resonance by incorporating the couplings of the $NN$ to the\n$N\\Delta$ and $\\Delta\\Delta$ systems, and the $\\gamma N \\to \\Delta$\ntransitions.

This new equilibrium set\nrepresents improved performance over common Lloyd-type algorithms.\nAdditionally, we detail how our algorithm scales well for large teams in large\nenvironments and how the computation can run in anytime with limited resources.\nFinally, we report on large-scale simulations in complex environments and\nhardware experiments using the Player/Stage robot control system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 22:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 10:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The challenge here is computational. In a complete market, in\nwhich one security is offered for each outcome, the market institution can not\nefficiently keep track of the transaction history or calculate security prices\nwhen the outcome space is large. The natural solution is to restrict the space\nof securities to be much smaller than the outcome space in such a way that\nsecurities can be priced efficiently. Recent research has focused on searching\nfor spaces of securities that can be priced efficiently by existing mechanisms\ndesigned for complete markets. While there have been some successes, much of\nthis research has led to hardness results. In this paper, we take a drastically\ndifferent approach. We start with an arbitrary space of securities with bounded\npayoff, and establish a framework to design markets tailored to this space. We\nprove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price\nsecurities via a convex potential function and that the space of reachable\nprices must be precisely the convex hull of the security payoffs. We then show\nhow the convex potential function can be defined in terms of an optimization\nover the convex hull of the security payoffs. The optimal solution to the\noptimization problem gives the security prices. Using this framework, we\nprovide an efficient market for predicting the landing location of an object on\na sphere. In addition, we show that we can relax our \"no-arbitrage\" condition\nto design a new efficient market maker for pair betting, which is known to be\n#P-hard to price using existing mechanisms. This relaxation also allows the\nmarket maker to charge transaction fees so that the depth of the market can be\ndynamically increased as the number of trades increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 22:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-10"}

In this\nchapter, the design issues of a number of mobility management schemes have been\npresented. Each of these schemes utilizes IP-based technologies to enable\nefficient roaming in heterogeneous network. Efficient handoff mechanisms are\nessential for ensuring seamless connectivity and uninterrupted service\ndelivery. A number of handoff schemes in a heterogeneous networking environment\nare also presented in this chapter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 02:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Maoz (2007) recently\nchallenged this picture based on the observation that the strength of\nultraviolet emission relative to the X-ray and radio bands does not depart from\nempirical trends defined by more luminous sources. He advocates that AGNs\nacross all luminosities have essentially the same accretion and radiative\nprocesses, which in luminous sources are described by a standard optically\nthick, geometrically thin disk. We calculate ADAF models and demonstrate that\nthey can successfully fit the observed spectral energy distributions of the\nLLAGNs in Maoz's sample. Our model naturally accommodates the radio and X-ray\nemission, and the ultraviolet flux is well explained by a combination of the\nfirst-order Compton scattering in the ADAF, synchrotron emission in the jet,\nand black body emission in the truncated thin disk. It is premature to dismiss\nthe ADAF model for LLAGNs. The UV data can be fit equally well using a standard\nthin disk, but an additional corona and jet would be required to account for\nthe X-ray and radio emission. We argue that there are strong theoretical\nreasons to prefer the ADAF model over the thin disk scenario.

In the second epoch, one velocity feature peaking at Vlsr=7491.1\nkm/s, redshifted by ~200 km/s relative to the systemic velocity, was detected\nonly toward the southern nucleus.

Then the following hold: (i) $V$ is a\nsemisimple $H$-module if and only if $H$ is $G$-completely reducible; (ii)\n$H^\\circ$ is reductive if and only if $H$ is $G$-completely reducible.\n  We also discuss two new related results: (i) if $p \\ge \\dim V$ for some\n$G$-module $V$ and $H$ is a $G$-completely reducible subgroup of $G$, then $V$\nis a semisimple $H$-module -- this generalizes Jantzen's semisimplicity theorem\n(which is the case $H = G$); (ii) if $H$ acts semisimply on $V \\otimes V^*$ for\nsome faithful $G$-module $V$, then $H$ is $G$-completely reducible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 09:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 07:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29"}

Recent hydrodynamic simulations by\nGlover & Mac Low have explicitly followed the formation and destruction of\nmolecules in model MCs under varying conditions, confirming that CO formation\nstrongly depends on the cloud properties. Conversely, the H2 formation is\nprimarily determined by the age of the MC. We apply radiative transfer\ncalculations to these MC models in order to investigate the properties of CO\nline emission. We focus on integrated CO (J=1-0) intensities emerging from\nindividual clouds, including its relationship to the total, H2, and CO column\ndensities, as well as the \"X factor,\" the ratio of H2 column density to CO\nintensity. Models with high CO abundances have a threshold CO intensity ~65 K\nkm/s at sufficiently large extinctions. Clouds with low CO abundances show no\nsuch intensity thresholds. The distribution of H2 column densities are well\ndescribed as log-normal functions, though the distributions of CO intensities\nand column densities are usually not log-normal. In general, the PDFs of the\nintegrated intensity do not follow the distribution functions of CO column\ndensities. In the model with Milky Way-like conditions, the X factor is in\nagreement with the near constant value determined from observations. In clouds\nwith lower CO abundances the X factor can vary appreciably - sometimes by > 4\norders of magnitude. In models with high densities, the CO line is fully\nsaturated, so that the X factor is directly proportional to the molecular\ncolumn density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 09:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 13:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nfirst set of limit theorems is for critically loaded $G/Ph/n+GI$ queues, where\nthe patience times are independent and identically distributed following a\ngeneral distribution. The next limit theorem is for overloaded $G/ Ph/n+M$\nqueues, where the patience time distribution is restricted to be exponential.\nWe prove that a pair of diffusion-scaled total-customer-count and\nserver-allocation processes, properly centered, converges in distribution to a\ncontinuous Markov process as the number of servers $n$ goes to infinity. In the\noverloaded case, the limit is a multi-dimensional diffusion process, and in the\ncritically loaded case, the limit is a simple transformation of a diffusion\nprocess. When the queues are critically loaded, our diffusion limit generalizes\nthe result by Puhalskii and Reiman (2000) for $GI/Ph/n$ queues without customer\nabandonment.

Most current approaches\nhave concentrated on bivariate models at a single sequence position. There is,\nhowever, considerable value in simultaneously modeling angle pairs at multiple\nsequence positions in a protein. One area of application for such models is in\nstructure prediction for the highly variable loop and turn regions. Such\nmodeling is difficult due to the fact that the number of known protein\nstructures available to estimate these torsion angle distributions is typically\nsmall. Furthermore, the data is \"sparse\" in that not all proteins have angle\npairs at each sequence position. We propose a new semiparametric model for the\njoint distributions of angle pairs at multiple sequence positions.

Mutants are assumed to have lower\nfitness than the master type, yet they coexist with it forming the\nquasi-species. When the mutation rate is sufficiently high, the master type no\nlonger survives and gets replaced by a wide range of mutant types, thus\ndestroying the quasi-species. It is the so-called \"error catastrophe\". But\nnatural selection acts on phenotypes, not genotypes, and huge amounts of\ngenotypes yield the same phenotype. An important consequence of this is the\nappearance of beneficial mutations which increase the fitness of mutants. A\nmodel has been recently proposed to describe quasi-species in the presence of\nbeneficial mutations. This model lacks the error catastrophe of Eigen's model\nand predicts a steady state in which the viral population grows exponentially.\nExtinction can only occur if the infectivity of the quasi-species is so low\nthat this exponential is negative. In this work I investigate the transient of\nthis model when infection is started from a small amount of low fitness\nvirions. I prove that, beyond an initial regime where viral population\ndecreases (and can go extinct), the growth of the population is\nsuper-exponential. Hence this population quickly becomes so huge that selection\ndue to lack of host cells to be infected begins to act before the steady state\nis reached. This result suggests that viral infection may widespread before the\nvirus has developed its optimal form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 13:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}

The\nstarburst radio galaxies -- comprising ~15 - 25% of all powerful extragalactic\nradio sources -- frequently show disturbed morphologies at optical wavelengths,\nand unusual radio structures, although their stellar masses are typical of\nradio galaxies as a class. In terms of the characteristic ages of their young\nstellar populations (YSP), the objects can be divided into two groups: those\nwith YSP ages t_ysp < 0.1 Gyr, in which the radio source has been triggered\nquasi-simultaneously with the main starburst episode, and those with older YSP\nin which the radio source has been triggered or re-triggered a significant\nperiod after the starburst episode. Combining the information on the YSP with\nthat on the optical morphologies of the host galaxies, we deduce that the\nmajority of the starburst radio galaxies have been triggered in galaxy mergers\nin which at least one of the galaxies is gas rich. However, the triggering (or\nre-triggering) of the radio jets can occur immediately before, around, or a\nsignificant period after the final coalescence of the merging nuclei,\nreflecting the complex gas infall histories of the merger events. Overall, our\nresults provide further evidence that powerful radio jet activity can be\ntriggered via a variety of mechanisms, including different evolutionary stages\nof major galaxy mergers; clearly radio-loud AGN activity is not solely\nassociated with a particular stage of a unique type of gas accretion event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 14:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

To address the problem, we introduce a Bayesian\nmodel to integrate multiple independent microarray data sets from three recent\ngenome-wide cell cycle studies on fission yeast. A hierarchical model was used\nfor data integration. In order to facilitate an efficient Monte Carlo sampling\nfrom the joint posterior distribution, we develop a novel Metropolis--Hastings\ngroup move. A surprising finding from our integrated analysis is that more than\n40% of the genes in fission yeast are significantly periodically expressed,\ngreatly enhancing the reported 10--15% of the genes in the current literature.\nIt calls for a reconsideration of the periodically expressed gene detection\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 14:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-10"}
