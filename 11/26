A processing grid network is proposed to underlie\nnot just matter and energy, but also space and time. The suggested \"screen\" for\nour familiar three dimensional world is a hyper-sphere surface simulated by a\ngrid network. Light and matter then travel, or are transmitted, in the\n\"directions\" of the grid architecture. The processing sequences of grid nodes\ncreate time, as the static states of movies run together emulate events. Yet\nhere what exists are not the static states, but the dynamic processing between\nthem. Quantum collapse is the irreversible event that gives time its direction.\nIn this model, empty space is null processing, directions are node links, time\nis processing cycles, light is a processing wave, objects are wave tangles and\nenergy is the processing transfer rate. It describes a world where empty space\nis not empty, space warps, time dilates, and everything began when this virtual\nuniverse \"booted up\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 04:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

Between 2005 and 2009, the UNBSSI activities\nwere dedicated to promoting activities related to the International\nHeliophysical Year 2007 (IHY), which contributed to the establishment of a\nseries of worldwide ground-based instrument networks, a node of which is also\noperated by the Office for Outer Space Affairs. Building on these\naccomplishments, UNBSSI is now focussing on the ISWI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 17:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-01"}

Its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light,\nand the early-time near-IR light curves show secondary maxima, although the\nminima between the first and second peaks are not very pronounced. Bluer bands\nexhibit an enhanced fading after ~200 d, which might be caused by dust\nformation or an unexpectedly early IR catastrophe. The spectra of SN 2009dc are\ndominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times,\nand by iron-group elements at late phases. Strong C II lines are present until\n~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear SNe. The ejecta\nvelocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous SNe Ia.\nNo signatures of CSM interaction are found in the spectra. Assuming that the\nlight curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests that\nSN 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56Ni assuming the smallest possible\nrise time of 22 d. Together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solar\nmasses, this confirms that SN 2009dc is a member of the class of possible\nsuper-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia similar to SNe 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if.

Such behaviour\nis typically interpreted as a significant level of persisting spin dynamics\n(PSD) of the host material. In the case of Gd2Sn2O7, such PSD comes as a\nsurprise since magnetic specific heat measurements suggest conventional gapped\nmagnons, which would naively lead to an exponentially vanishing $\\lambda(T)$ as\n$T \\rightarrow 0$. In contrast to most materials that display PSD, the ordered\nphase of Gd2Sn2O7 is well characterized and both the nature and the magnitude\nof the interactions have been inferred from the magnetic structure and the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat. Based on this\nunderstanding, the temperature dependence of the muon spin polarization\nrelaxation through the scattering of spin waves (magnons) is calculated. The\nresult explicitly shows that, despite the unusual extensive number of weakly\ndispersive (gapped)excitations characterizing Gd2Sn2O7, a remnant of the zero\nmodes of the parent frustrated pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet, the\ntemperature dependence of the calculated $\\lambda(T)$ differs dramatically from\nthe experimental one. Indeed, the calculation conforms to the naive expectation\nof an exponential collapse of $\\lambda(T)$ at temperatures below ~ 0.7K. This\nresult, for the first time, illustrates crisply and quantitatively the paradox\nthat presents itself with the pervasive occurrence of PSD in highly frustrated\nmagnetic systems as evinced by muon spin relaxation measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 20:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

Various passive depth computation\ntechniques have been developed for computer vision applications. They can be\nclassified into two groups. The first group operates using just one image.

For the first time, we embed the galaxies in a\nmagnetized, low-density medium, thus modeling an ambient IGM. The simulations\ninclude radiative cooling and a model for star formation and supernova\nfeedback. The progenitor disks have initial magnetic seed fields in the range\nof 10e-9 to 10e-6 G and the IGM has initial fields of 10e-12 to 10e-9 G. The\nsimulations are compared to a run excluding magnetic fields. We show that the\npropagation of interaction-driven shocks depends significantly on the initial\nmagnetic field strength. The shocks propagate faster in simulations with\nstronger initial field, suggesting that the shocks are supported by magnetic\npressure. The Mach numbers of the shocks range from approximately M=1.5 for the\nnon-magnetized case up to M=6 for the highest initial magnetization, resulting\nin higher temperatures of the shock heated IGM gas. The magnetic field in the\nsystem saturates rapidly after the mergers at ~ 10e-6 G within the galaxies and\n~ 10e-8 G in the IGM independent of the initial value. These field strengths\nagree with observed values and correspond to the equipartition value of the\nmagnetic pressure with the turbulent pressure in the system. We also present\nsynthetic radio and polarization maps for different phases of the evolution\nshowing that shocks driven by the interaction produce a high amount of\npolarized emission. These idealized simulations indicate that magnetic fields\nplay an important role for the hydrodynamics of the IGM during galactic\ninteractions. We also show that even weak seed fields are efficiently\nstrengthened during multiple galactic mergers. This interaction driven\namplification might have been a key process for the magnetization of the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 09:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 14:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The sample is composed of normal ETGs having effective\nradii comparable to the mean radius of local ones and of compact ETGs having\neffective radii from two to six times smaller. We do not find evidence of a\ndependence of the compactness of ETGs on their stellar mass. We find that the\nstellar mass of normal ETGs formed at z_form<3 while the stellar content of\ncompact ETGs formed at 2<z_form<10 with a large fraction of them characterized\nby z_form>5. Earlier stars formed at z_form>5 are assembled in compact and more\nmassive (M_*>10^11 M_sun) ETGs while stars later formed (z_form<3) or resulting\nfrom subsequent episodes of star formation are assembled both in compact and\nnormal ETGs. Thus, the older the stellar population the higher the mass of the\nhosting galaxy but not vice versa. This suggests that the epoch of formation\nmay play a role in the formation of massive ETGs rather than the mass itself.\nThe possible general scheme in which normal <z>~1.5 ETGs are descendants of\nhigh-z compact spheroids enlarged through subsequent dry mergers is not\ncompatible with the current models which predict a number of dry mergers two\norders of magnitude lower than the one needed. Moreover, we do not find\nevidence supporting a dependence of the compactness of galaxies on their\nredshift of assembly.

For bright sources this classification can be done\nwith almost complete reliability, but for the numerous sources close to a\nsurvey's detection limit each image encodes only limited morphological\ninformation. In this regime, from which many of the new scientific discoveries\nare likely to come, it is vital to utilise all the available information about\na source, both from multiple measurements and also prior knowledge about the\nstar and galaxy populations. It is also more useful and realistic to provide\nclassification probabilities than decisive classifications. All these\ndesiderata can be met by adopting a Bayesian approach to star-galaxy\nclassification, and we develop a very general formalism for doing so. An\nimmediate implication of applying Bayes's theorem to this problem is that it is\nformally impossible to combine morphological measurements in different bands\nwithout using colour information as well; however we develop several\napproximations that disregard colour information as much as possible. The\nresultant scheme is applied to data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey\n(UKIDSS), and tested by comparing the results to deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) Stripe 82 measurements of the same sources. The Bayesian classification\nprobabilities obtained from the UKIDSS data agree well with the deep SDSS\nclassifications both overall (a mismatch rate of 0.022, compared to 0.044 for\nthe UKIDSS pipeline classifier) and close to the UKIDSS detection limit (a\nmismatch rate of 0.068 compared to 0.075 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier).\nThe Bayesian formalism developed here can be applied to improve the reliability\nof any star-galaxy classification schemes based on the measured values of\nmorphology statistics alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 12:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

These data\nallow us to conclude, with some confidence, that the emission at 16 micron in\npassive ETGs is stellar in origin, consistent with previous work concluding\nthat the excess mid-infrared emission comes from the dusty envelopes around\nevolved AGB stars. There is little evidence for the mid-infrared emission of an\nunresolved central component, as might arise in the presence of a dusty torus\nassociated with a low-luminosity AGN. We nonetheless find that the 16 micron\nemission is more centrally peaked than the near-infrared emission, implying a\nradial stellar population gradient. By comparing with independent evidence from\nstudies at optical wavelengths, we conclude that a metallicity that falls with\nincreasing radius is the principal driver of the observed gradient. We also\nplot the mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagram and combine with similar work on\nthe Coma cluster to define the colour-magnitude relation for absolute K-band\nmagnitudes from -26 to -19. Because a correlation between mass and age would\nproduce a relation with a gradient in the opposite sense to that observed, we\nconclude that the relation reflects the fact that passive ETGs of lower mass\nalso have a lower average metallicity. The colour-magnitude relation is thus\ndriven by metallicity effects. In contrast to what is found in Coma, we do not\nfind any objects with anomalously bright 16 micron emission relative to the\ncolour-magnitude relation. Although there is little overlap in the mass ranges\nprobed in the two clusters, this may suggest that observable ``rejuvenation''\nepisodes are limited to intermediate mass objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 13:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Here we describe\noptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed to\nexplain formation of this system. Radio timing measurements of three\npost-Keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of a\nmillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidence\nlimit) (...). Optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart show\nthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore its\nbinary companion (...) The optical detection also provides a measurement of the\nsystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measured\nfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-D velocity in the\nGalaxy. We find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of the\nGalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the Galactic centre. Thus an\nexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster or\nthe Galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. We suggest\nthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbit\nwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.\nThe neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner MS companion,\nforming a millisecond pulsar. The former donor star then disappears, either due\nto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion of\nthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case of\na very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formed\nmillisecond pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 14:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The origin of this\ncorrelation is not clear. It may result from a relation between the black hole\nmass (M_BH) and metallicity, or from a relation between the accretion rate\n(L/L_Edd) and metallicity. To investigate the origin of the L_AGN-Z_AGN\nrelation, we use optical spectra of 2383 quasars at 2.3 < z < 3.0 from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. By using this data set, we have constructed composite\nspectra of 33 subsamples in intervals of both M_BH and L/L_Edd. From these\ncomposite spectra we measure emission-line flux ratios that are sensitive to\nthe metallicity of the broad line region (BLR); specifically, NV/CIV, NV/HeII,\n(SiIV+OIV])/CIV, and AlIII/CIV. We find that there is a significant correlation\nbetween M_BH and Z_BLR as inferred from all four metallicity-sensitive\nemission-line flux ratios. This result strongly suggests that the observed\nL_AGN-Z_AGN relation is mostly a consequence of the M_BH-Z_AGN relation. The\nrelation between M_BH and Z_BLR is likely a consequence of both the M_BH-M_bul\nrelation and of the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxy. We also find\nthat L/L_Edd correlates with the emission line flux ratios involving NV (more\nspecifically, NV/CIV and NV/HeII), while it does not correlate with the other\ntwo metallicity sensitive emission line flux ratios, i.e., (SiIV+OIV])/CIV and\nAlIII/CIV. These correlations indicate that the emission-line flux ratios\ninvolving NV depend on both metallicity and relative abundance of nitrogen. We\nsuggest that the relation between L/L_Edd and those line ratios involving\nnitrogen, is caused by a delay of the black hole accretion rate relative to the\nonset of nuclear star formation of about 10^8 years, which is the timescale\nrequired for the nitrogen enrichment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 14:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

These operators may modify the standard model Higgs potential in\nmany ways, one of which being the appearance of a second vacuum. For a wide\nrange of parameters, this new vacuum becomes the true vacuum. It is then\nassumed that our universe is currently sitting in the false vacuum. Thus the\nusual second-order electroweak phase transition at early times will be followed\nby a second, first-order phase transition. In cosmology, a first-order phase\ntransition is associated with the production of gravity waves. In this paper we\npresent an analysis of the production of gravitational waves during such a\nsecond electroweak phase transition. We find that, for one certain range of\nparameters, the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by\nbubble nucleation and collision have an amplitude which is estimated to be of\norder $\\Omega_{GW}h^2\\sim10^{-11}$ at $f=3\\times 10^{-4}$Hz, which is within\nreach of the planned sensitivity of LISA. For another range of parameters, we\nfind that the amplitude is estimated o be of order $\\Omega_{GW}h^2\\sim10^{-25}$\naround $f=10^3$Hz, which is within reach of LIGO. Hence, it is possible to\ndetect gravity waves from such a phase transition at two different detectors,\nwith completely different amplitude and frequency ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 21:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

In general relativity, the\nPenrose inequality relates the mass and the entropy associated with a\ngravitational background. If the inequality is violated by some Cauchy data, it\nsuggests a creation of a naked singularity, thus providing means to consider\nthe cosmic censorship hypothesis. The analogous inequality in the context of\nfluid dynamics can provide a valuable tool in the study of finite-time blowups\nin hydrodynamics. We derive the inequality for relativistic and nonrelativistic\nfluid flows in general dimension. We show that the inequality is always\nsatisfied at the ideal fluid order. At the leading viscous order, the\ninequality may be violated by relativistic fluid flows, while it is always\nsatisfied by nonrelativistic incompressible flows. The inequality may be\nviolated at the next to leading viscous order by both relativistic and\nnonrelativistic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 22:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 13:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-18"}

Instead, fragmentation occurs for longer cooling timescales\nas the resolution is increased. These results certainly suggest that\nbeta_{crit} is larger than previously thought.

In light of\nthese results, we caution against using cooling timescale or gravitational\nstress arguments to deduce whether gravitational instability may or may not\nhave been the formation mechanism for observed planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 22:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
