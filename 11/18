In August 2010, the sudden optical brightening of two young stellar\nobjects, located in the North America/Pelican Nebula Complex, was announced.\nEarly observations indicated that these objects may belong to the FUor or EXor\nclass of young eruptive stars. The eruptions of FUors and EXors are often\nexplained by enhanced accretion of material from the circumstellar disk to the\nprotostar. Aims. In order to determine the true nature of these two objects, we\nstarted an optical and near-infrared monitoring program, and complemented our\ndata with archival observations and data from the literature. Methods. We plot\nand analyze pre-outburst and outburst spectral energy distributions (SEDs),\nmulti-filter light curves, and color-color diagrams. Results. HBC 722\nbrightened monotonically in about two months, and the SED obtained during\nmaximum brightness indicates the appearance of a hot, single-temperature\nblackbody. The current fading rate implies that the star will return to\nquiescence in about a year, questioning its classification as a bone fide FUor.\nThe outburst of VSX J205126.1+440523 happened more gradually, but reached an\nunprecedentedly high amplitude. At 2.5 months after the peak, its light curves\nshow a deep minimum, when the object was close to its pre-outburst optical\nbrightness. Further monitoring indicates that it is still far from being\nquiescent. Conclusions. The shape of the light curves, the bolometric\nluminosities and accretion rates suggest that these objects do not fit into the\nclassic FUor group. Although HBC 722 exhibit all spectral characteristics of a\nbona fide FUor, its luminosity and accretion rate is too low, and its timescale\nis too fast compared to classical FUors. VSX J205126.1+440523 seems to be an\nexample where quick extinction changes modulate the light curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 17:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 15:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number\nof open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy\nis transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its\nactual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a\nbroad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution\nMHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy\ntransfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and\nsmaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in\n(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) \"fragmenting\ncoalescence\" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation\nof the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At\nthe later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes\nreveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is\nshown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar\nflare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of\n(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy\nrelease, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,\nspontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised\ndissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be\nintrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may\nalso facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles.

Large buoyant slab segments sink more slowly into the asthenosphere,\nand their subduction result in a diminution of the velocity of subduction of\nthe plate. We observe a steeping of the slab below those buoyant anomalies,\nresulting in smaller radius of curvature of the slab, that augments the energy\ndissipated in folding the plate and further diminishes the velocity of\nsubduction.

We show that the nature\nof this reported offset may be explained by a recently proposed\nanti-correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the metallicity of\nstar forming galaxies. If low metallicity galaxies produce more stars than\ntheir equally massive, high-metallicity counterparts, then transient events\nthat closely trace the SFR in a galaxy would be more likely to be found in\nthese low metallicity, low mass galaxies. Therefore, the offset between the GRB\nand SDSS defined M-Z relations may be the result of the different methods used\nto select their respective galaxy populations, with GRBs being biased towards\nlow metallicity, high SFR, galaxies. We predict that such an offset should not\nbe expected of transient events that do not closely follow the star formation\nhistory of their host galaxies, such as short duration GRBs and SN Ia, but\nshould be evident in core collapse SNe found through upcoming untargeted\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We measure the\nasymmetries and core wavelengths of a set of unblended FeI lines covering a\nwide range of line strength. Line bisectors exhibit the characteristic C-shape\nsignature of surface convection (granulation) and they span from about 100 m/s\nin the strongest FeI features to 800 m/s in the weakest ones. Core wavelength\nshifts range from about -100 to -900 m/s, depending on line strength. In\ngeneral, larger blueshifts are observed in weaker lines, but there is\nincreasing scatter with increasing residual flux. Assuming local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE), we synthesize the same set of spectral lines using a\nstate-of-the-art three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation for a stellar\natmosphere of fundamental parameters similar to those of HD122563. We find good\nagreement between model predictions and observations. This allows us to infer\nan absolute zero-point for the line shifts and radial velocity. Moreover, it\nindicates that the structure and dynamics of the simulation are realistic, thus\nproviding support to previous claims of large 3D-LTE corrections, based on the\nhydrodynamic model used here, to elemental abundances and fundamental\nparameters of very metal-poor red giant stars obtained with standard 1D-LTE\nspectroscopic analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 21:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Despite long-standing interest in the compartmental structure of\nfood webs, past network analyses of food webs have been constrained by a\nstandard definition of compartments, or modules, that requires many links\nwithin compartments and few links between them. Empirical analyses have been\nfurther limited by low-resolution data for primary producers. In this paper, we\npresent a Bayesian computational method for identifying group structure in food\nwebs using a flexible definition of a group that can describe both functional\nroles and standard compartments. The Serengeti ecosystem provides an\nopportunity to examine structure in a newly compiled food web that includes\nspecies-level resolution among plants, allowing us to address whether groups in\nthe food web correspond to tightly-connected compartments or functional groups,\nand whether network structure reflects spatial or trophic organization, or a\ncombination of the two. We have compiled the major mammalian and plant\ncomponents of the Serengeti food web from published literature, and we infer\nits group structure using our method. We find that network structure\ncorresponds to spatially distinct plant groups coupled at higher trophic levels\nby groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus\nthe group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild\nstructure and spatial patterns, in contrast to the standard compartments\ntypically identified in ecological networks. From data consisting only of nodes\nand links, the group structure that emerges supports recent ideas on spatial\ncoupling and energy channels in ecosystems that have been proposed as important\nfor persistence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 21:23:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 22:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

Properties of this two-dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG) have attracted significant interest due to its potential\napplications in nanoelectronics. Control over this carrier density and mobility\nof the 2DEG is essential for applications of these novel systems, and may be\nachieved by epitaxial strain. However, despite the rich nature of strain\neffects on oxide materials properties, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, and\nsuperconductivity, the relationship between the strain and electrical\nproperties of the 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface remains largely\nunexplored. Here, we use different lattice constant single crystal substrates\nto produce LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces with controlled levels of biaxial epitaxial\nstrain. We have found that tensile strained SrTiO3 destroys the conducting\n2DEG, while compressively strained SrTiO3 retains the 2DEG, but with a carrier\nconcentration reduced in comparison to the unstrained LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface.\nWe have also found that the critical LaAlO3 overlayer thickness for 2DEG\nformation increases with SrTiO3 compressive strain. Our first-principles\ncalculations suggest that a strain-induced electric polarization in the SrTiO3\nlayer is responsible for this behavior. It is directed away from the interface\nand hence creates a negative polarization charge opposing that of the polar\nLaAlO3 layer. This both increases the critical thickness of the LaAlO3 layer,\nand reduces carrier concentration above the critical thickness, in agreement\nwith our experimental results. Our findings suggest that epitaxial strain can\nbe used to tailor 2DEGs properties of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 21:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We demonstrate that if weak, Solar-like winds\nare launched from low-mass Pop III stars formed in the progenitors of the dark\nmatter halo of the Galaxy, then such stars are likely to avoid significant\nenrichment via accretion of material from the interstellar medium. We find that\nat early times accretion is easily prevented if the stars are ejected from the\ncentral regions of the haloes in which they form, either by dynamical\ninteractions with more massive Pop III stars, or by violent relaxation during\nhalo mergers. While accretion may still take place during passage through\nsufficiently dense molecular clouds at later times, we find that the\nprobability of such a passage is generally low (< 0.1), assuming that stars\nhave velocities of order the maximum circular velocity of their host haloes and\naccounting for the orbital decay of merging haloes. In turn, due to the higher\ngas density required for accretion onto stars with higher velocities, we find\nan even lower probability of accretion (~ 0.01) for the subset of Pop III stars\nformed at z > 10, which are more quickly incorporated into massive haloes than\nstars formed at lower redshift. While there is no a priori reason to assume\nthat low-mass Pop III stars do not have Solar-like winds, without them surface\nenrichment via accretion is likely to be inevitable.

The method of QNM uses, as tools of analysis, the Green's function\nand biorthogonal spaces. The 1D-PBG is studied in a more realistic way : a\nfinite structure, immersed in an unlimited space. The renunciation of energy\nconservation for the system under consideration has important consequences,\nboth numerical and conceptual: it goes from real autofrequencies to complex\nquasi-autofrequencies. Moreover, as the operator describing the evolution of\nspace-time is not hermitian, the modes are no longer normal, but quasi-normal:\nin fact, only under appropriate conditions, they not only provide a basis\northogonal, but their space-time evolution is similar to that of the Hermitian\nnormal modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 23:19:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 10:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 17:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

The purpose of this paper is twofold.\nThe first is to give an explanation on how and why the singular vectors can be\nused in clustering. And the second is to show that the two seemingly unrelated\nSVD aspects actually originate from the same source: related vertices tend to\nbe more clustered in the graph representation of lower rank approximate matrix\nusing the SVD than in the original semantic graph. Accordingly, the SVD can\nimprove retrieval performance of an information retrieval system since queries\nmade to the approximate matrix can retrieve more relevant documents and filter\nout more irrelevant documents than the same queries made to the original\nmatrix. By utilizing this fact, we will devise an LSI algorithm that mimicks\nSVD capability in clustering related vertices. Convergence analysis shows that\nthe algorithm is convergent and produces a unique solution for each input.\nExperimental results using some standard datasets in LSI research show that\nretrieval performances of the algorithm are comparable to the SVD's. In\naddition, the algorithm is more practical and easier to use because there is no\nneed to determine decomposition rank which is crucial in driving retrieval\nperformance of the SVD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 23:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 18:56:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 08:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 04:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-19"}

This is contradicted by field\nobservations, where extended conduits, sometimes several kilometers long, are\nfound in karst environments. However, a sharp drop in the dissolution rate of\nCaCO_3 near saturation provides a mechanism for much deeper penetration of\nreactant. The notion of a \"kinetic trigger\" - a sudden change in rate constant\nover a narrow concentration range - has become a widely accepted paradigm in\nspeleogenesis modeling. However, it is based on one-dimensional models for the\nfluid and solute transport inside the fracture, assuming that the dissolution\nfront is planar in the direction perpendicular to the flow. Here we show that\nthis assumption is incorrect; a planar dissolution front in an entirely uniform\nfracture is unstable to infinitesimal perturbations and inevitably breaks up\ninto highly localized regions of dissolution. This provides an alternative\nmechanism for cave formation, even in the absence of a kinetic trigger. Our\nresults suggest that there is an inherent wavelength to the erosion pattern in\ndissolving fractures, which depends on the reaction rate and flow rate, but is\nindependent of the initial roughness. In contrast to one-dimensional models,\ntwo-dimensional simulations indicate that there is only a weak dependence of\nthe breakthrough time on kinetic order; localization of the flow tends to keep\nthe undersaturation in the dissolution front above the threshold for non-linear\nkinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 00:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

Hereby we mean\nthe problem, formulated by J-L. Loday in \\cite{LodayEns}, is that of finding a\ngeneralization of the Lie's third theorem for Leibniz algebra. That is, we\nsearch a manifold provided with an algebraic structure which generalizes the\nstructure of a (local) Lie group, and such that the tangent space at a\ndistinguished point is a Leibniz algebra structure. Moreover, when the Leibniz\nalgebra is a Lie algebra, we want that the integrating manifold is a Lie group.\nIn his article \\cite{Kinyon}, M.K.

The\ndistinguishing feature of these diagrams is that edges need not be connected to\nvertices at both ends, and these unconnected ends can be interpreted as the\ninputs and outputs of a diagram. In this paper, we give a concrete construction\nfor string diagrams using a special kind of typed graph called an open-graph.\nWhile the category of open-graphs is not itself adhesive, we introduce the\nnotion of a selective adhesive functor, and show that such a functor embeds the\ncategory of open-graphs into the ambient adhesive category of typed graphs.\nUsing this functor, the category of open-graphs inherits \"enough adhesivity\"\nfrom the category of typed graphs to perform double-pushout (DPO) graph\nrewriting. A salient feature of our theory is that it ensures rewrite systems\nare \"type-safe\" in the sense that rewriting respects the inputs and outputs.\nThis formalism lets us safely encode the interesting structure of a\ncomputational model, such as evaluation dynamics, with succinct, explicit\nrewrite rules, while the graphical representation absorbs many of the tedious\ndetails. Although topological formalisms exist for string diagrams, our\nconstruction is discreet, finitary, and enjoys decidable algorithms for\ncomposition and rewriting. We also show how open-graphs can be parametrised by\ngraphical signatures, similar to the monoidal signatures of Joyal and Street,\nwhich define types for vertices in the diagrammatic language and constraints on\nhow they can be connected. Using typed open-graphs, we can construct free\nsymmetric monoidal categories, PROPs, and more general monoidal theories.

Penrose has proposed a\nconjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the\noccurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black\nholes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day\nobservational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities\nfrom black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks\nproperties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,\nrespectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating\nnaked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the\nEinstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between\nrotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging\neffect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely\nproportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior\ngeometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are\ndifferent for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear\nobservational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked\nsingularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar\ncharge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can\nexceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black\nhole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by\nrotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency\nfor black holes. Thus, these observational signatures may provide the necessary\ntools from clearly distinguishing rotating naked singularities from Kerr-type\nblack holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 03:01:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 04:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

This arises from alterations\nin synaptic functioning of neurons leading to cognitive impairment and memory\nloss. Recent experimental studies indicate that the amyloid beta (A beta)\nprotein, in its dimer and oligomer forms, affects the synaptic activity of\nneurons in the early stages of AD. However, the precise mechanism underlying A\nbeta induced synaptic depression is still not clearly understood. In this\npaper, we introduce an electrical model that provides a possible mechanism for\nthis. Our studies show that the competing effects of synaptic activity and the\nindirect interaction mediated by A beta, can disrupt the synchrony among\nneurons and severely affect the neuronal activity. This then leads to\nsub-threshold activity or synaptic silencing. This is in agreement with the\nreported disruption of cortical synaptic integration in the presence of A beta\nin transgenic mice. We suggest that direct electrophysiological measurements of\nA beta activity can establish its role in AD and the possible revival, proposed\nin our model.

At low bias and\nlow temperature a strong current suppression is found around the electron-hole\nsymmetry point independent of the couplings, in agreement with previous\nresults. By means of a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we are able to give an\nintuitive explanation to this suppression in the low-energy regime. In the\ngeneral situation, numerical simulations are carried out using quantum rate\nequations. The simulations allow for the prediction of how the suppression is\naffected by the couplings, the charging energy, the position of the energy\nlevels, the applied bias, and the temperature. We find that away from\nelectron-hole symmetry, the parity of the couplings is essential for the\ncurrent suppression. It is also shown how broadening, interference, and a\nfinite interaction energy cause a shift of the current minimum away from\ndegeneracy.

Because of this fluctuating motion, it has been\ndiscussed that the accelerated charged particle emits extra radiation (the\nUnruh radiation) in addition to the classical Larmor radiation, and experiments\nare under planning to detect such radiation by using ultrahigh intensity lasers\nconstructed in near future. There are, however, counterarguments that the\nradiation is canceled by an interference effect between the vacuum fluctuation\nand the fluctuating motion. In fact, in the case of an internal detector where\nthe Heisenberg equation of motion can be solved exactly, there is no additional\nradiation after the thermalization is completed. In this paper, we revisit the\nissue in the case of an accelerated charged particle in the scalar-field analog\nof QED.

The object is a V ~ 20.5 mag star, ten times\nbrighter than any other established counterpart of a ULX in nearby galaxies.\nMedium resolution optical spectroscopy carried out in 2008 and 2009 with the\nESO-VLT reveals the presence of narrow high order Balmer, HeI and MgII\nabsorption lines indicating a late B type supergiant companion star with mass\nbetween 10 and 20 Msol. Stellar H beta and HeII 4686 emission lines are also\nseen superposed on the photospheric spectrum. We detect different patterns of\nradial velocity variations from the emission and absorption lines over a time\ninterval of one month. The velocity of the high order Balmer absorption lines\nchanges by ~ 100 km/s while the H beta and HeI 4686 emission components vary by\nabout the same amount but with a different phasing. Assuming that the observed\nvelocity changes trace the motion of the mass-donor star and of the X-ray\nsource implies a mass of the accreting black hole in the range of 3 to 100 Msol\nwith a most probable value of ~ 10 to 20 Msol.
