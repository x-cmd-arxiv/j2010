Most likely, the same mechanism\nproduces radio bursts from ultracool dwarfs. We investigate amplification of\nplasma waves by the horseshoe-like electron distribution (similar to those\nobserved in the terrestrial magnetosphere) as well as relaxation of this\ndistribution due to the ECMI. We aim to determine parameters of the generated\nplasma waves, timescales of the relaxation process, and the conversion\nefficiency of the particle energy into waves. We have developed a kinetic\nrelativistic quasi-linear 2D code for simulating the coevolution of an electron\ndistribution and the high-frequency plasma waves. The code includes the\nprocesses of wave growth and particle diffusion which are assumed to be much\nfaster than other processes (particle injection, etc.). A number of simulations\nhave been performed for different parameter sets which seem to be typical for\nthe magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs (in particular, the plasma frequency is\nmuch less than the cyclotron one). The calculations have shown that the\nfundamental extraordinary mode dominates strongly. The generated waves have the\nfrequency slightly below the electron cyclotron frequency and propagate across\nthe magnetic field. The final intensities of other modes are negligible. The\nconversion efficiency of the electron energy into the extraordinary waves is\ntypically around 10%. Complete relaxation of the unstable electron distribution\ntakes much less than a second. Energy efficiency of the ECMI is more than\nsufficient to provide the observed intensity of radio emission from ultracool\ndwarfs. On the other hand, the observed light curves of the emission are not\nrelated to the properties of this instability and reflect, most likely,\ndynamics of the electron acceleration process and/or geometry of the radiation\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 16:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

We derive a general\nmodel for the collisional evolution of an irregular satellite swarm and apply\nit to the Solar System and extrasolar planets. Our model reproduces the Solar\nSystem's complement of observed irregulars well, and suggests that the\ncompetition between grain-grain collisions and Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag\nhelps set the fate of the dust. Because swarm collision rates decrease over\ntime the main dust sink can change with time, and may help unravel the\naccretion history of synchronously rotating regular satellites that show\nbrightness asymmetries. Some level of dust must be present on AU scales around\nthe Solar System's giant planets, which we predict may be at detectable levels.\nWe also predict whether dust produced by extrasolar circumplanetary swarms can\nbe detected. The coronagraphic instruments on JWST will have the ability to\ndetect the dust generated by these swarms, which are most detectable around\nplanets that orbit at tens of AU from the youngest stars. Because the\ncollisional decay of swarms is relatively insensitive to planet mass, swarms\ncan be much brighter than their host planets and allow discovery of\nNeptune-mass planets that would otherwise remain invisible. This dust may have\nalready been detected. The observations of the planet Fomalhaut b can be\nexplained as scattered light from dust produced by the collisional decay of an\nirregular satellite swarm around a 10 Earth-mass planet. Such a swarm comprises\nabout 5 Lunar masses worth of irregular satellites. Finally, we consider what\nhappens if Fomalhaut b passes through Fomalhaut's main debris ring, which\nallows the circumplanetary swarm to be replenished through collisions with ring\nplanetesimals.

Noting that this temperature window exceeds\nthe fluctuation dominated regime drastically and that in these materials the\nspatial extent of homogeneity is limited, we explore the relevance of the zero\ndimensional (0D)-model, neglecting thermal fluctuations. It is shown that both,\nthe full 0D-model as well as its Gaussian approximation, mimic the essential\nfeatures of the isothermal magnetization curves in Pb nanoparticles and various\ncuprates remarkably well. This analysis also provides estimates for the spatial\nextent of the homogeneous domains giving rise to a smeared transition in zero\nmagnetic field. The resulting estimates for the amplitude of the in-plane\ncorrelation length exhibit a doping dependence reflecting the flow to the\nquantum phase transition in the underdoped limit. Furthermore it is shown that\nthe isothermal Nernst signal of a superconducting Nb_(0.15)Si_(0.85) film is\nfully consistent with this scenario. Accordingly, the observed diamagnetism\nabove T_c in Pb nanoparticles, in the cuprates La_(1.91)Sr_(0.09)CuO_4 and\nBiSr_2Ca_2CuO_(8-d), as well as the Nernst signal in Nb_(0.15)Si_(0.85) films,\nare all in excellent agreement with the scaling properties emerging from the\n0D-model, giving a universal perspective on the interplay between diamagnetism,\nNernst signal, correlation length, and the limited spatial extent of\nhomogeneity.

Spitzer/IRS measurements indicate\nthat the warm dust is present at distances as close as a few AU from the star.\nIts origin is puzzling, since an \"asteroid belt\" that could produce this dust\nwould be unstable because of the known inner planet. Aims: Here we test the\nhypothesis that the observed warm dust is generated by collisions in the outer\nbelt and is transported inward by Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag and strong\nstellar winds. Methods: We simulated a steady-state distribution of dust\nparticles outside 10AU with a collisional code and in the inner region (r<10AU)\nwith single-particle numerical integrations. By assuming homogeneous spherical\ndust grains composed of water ice and silicate, we calculated the thermal\nemission of the dust and compared it with observations. We investigated two\ndifferent orbital configurations for the inner planet inferred from RV\nmeasurements, one with a highly eccentric orbit of e=0.7 and another one with a\nmoderate one of e=0.25. We also produced a simulation without a planet.\nResults: Our models can reproduce the shape and magnitude of the observed SED\nfrom mid-IR to sub-mm wavelengths, as well as the Spitzer/MIPS radial\nbrightness profiles. The best-fit dust composition includes both ice and\nsilicates. The results are similar for the two possible planetary orbits and\nwithout a planet. Conclusions: The observed warm dust in the system can indeed\nstem from the outer belt and be transported inward by P-R and stellar wind\ndrag. The inner planet has little effect on the distribution of dust, so that\nthe planetary orbit could not be constrained. Reasonable agreement between the\nmodel and observations can only be achieved by relaxing the assumption of\npurely silicate dust and assuming a mixture of silicate and ice in comparable\namounts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 17:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Such low-$T/|W|$ instability can give rise to efficient\ngravitational wave emission from the proto-neutron star. We investigate how\nthis instability is affected by magnetic fields using a cylindrical stellar\nmodel. Wave absorption at the corotation resonance plays an important role in\nfacilitating the hydrodynamic low-$T/|W|$ instability. In the presence of a\ntoroidal magnetic field, the corotation resonance is split into two magnetic\nresonances where wave absorptions take place.

Although poloidal magnetic\nfields do not influence the instability directly, they can affect the\ninstability by generating toroidal fields through linear winding of the initial\npoloidal field and magneto-rotational instability.

We propose that an indeterministic\ndynamics can be $weakly$ compatible with free will (FW), whereby the latter\nacts by altering the probability distribution over allowed outcomes. In the\nquantum physical world, such a FW can collapse the wave function, introducing\ndeviations from the Born rule.

However, in practice, these deviations would not be\ndirectly or easily observable, because they occur in sub-neuronal\nsuperpositions in the brain, where they would be shrouded in random measurement\nerrors, noise and statistical fluctuations. Our result elucidates the\ndifference between the FW of human observers and that of observed particles in\nthe Free Will Theorem. This difference is a basic reason for why FW (and, in\ngeneral, consciousness) cannot be recreated by standard artificial intelligence\n(AI) technology. We propose various neurobiological experiments to test our\nproposed theory.

An overdamped Drude response and a small\nconductivity anisotropy observed in optics is consistent with a weakly\ntemperature dependent dc conductivity and anisotropy at high temperatures. The\nsplitting of the molecular vibrations nu27(Bu) evidences the abrupt onset of\nstatic charge order below TCO=136 K. The drop of optical conductivity measured\nwithin the ab plane of the crystal is characterized by an isotropic gap that\nopens of approximately 75 meV with several phonons becoming pronounced below.\nConversely, the dc conductivity anisotropy rises steeply, attaining at 50 K a\nvalue 25 times larger than at high temperatures. The dielectric response within\nthis plane reveals two broad relaxation modes of strength Deltaepsilon_LD ~=\n5000 and Deltaepsilon_SD ~= 400, centered at 1 kHz < f_LD < 100 MHz and f_SD ~=\n1 MHz. The anisotropy of the large-mode (LD) mean relaxation time closely\nfollows the temperature behavior of the respective dc conductivity ratio. We\nargue that this phason-like excitation is best described as a long-wavelength\nexcitation of a 2kF bond-charge density wave expected theoretically for layered\nquarter-filled electronic systems with horizontal stripes. Conversely, based on\nthe theoretically expected ferroelectric-like nature of the charge-ordered\nphase, we associate the small-mode (SD) relaxation with the motion of\ndomain-wall pairs, created at the interface between two types of domains, along\nthe a and b axes.

The sandwich smoother has a tensor product\nstructure that simplifies an asymptotic analysis and it can be fast computed.\nWe derive a local central limit theorem for the sandwich smoother, with simple\nexpressions for the asymptotic bias and variance, by showing that the sandwich\nsmoother is asymptotically equivalent to a bivariate kernel regression\nestimator with a product kernel. As far as we are aware, this is the first\ncentral limit theorem for a bivariate spline estimator of any type. Our\nsimulation study shows that the sandwich smoother is orders of magnitude faster\nto compute than other bivariate spline smoothers, even when the latter are\ncomputed using a fast GLAM (Generalized Linear Array Model) algorithm, and\ncomparable to them in terms of mean squared integrated errors. We extend the\nsandwich smoother to array data of higher dimensions, where a GLAM algorithm\nimproves the computational speed of the sandwich smoother. One important\napplication of the sandwich smoother is to estimate covariance functions in\nfunctional data analysis. In this application, our numerical results show that\nthe sandwich smoother is orders of magnitude faster than local linear\nregression.

Our\napproach is an adaptation of Burnett's formulation of the \"shortwave\napproximation\", which we generalize to analyze the effects of matter\ninhomogeneities as well as gravitational radiation. Our framework requires the\nmetric to be close to a \"background metric\", but allows arbitrarily large\nstress-energy fluctuations on small scales. We prove that, within our\nframework, if the matter stress-energy tensor satisfies the weak energy\ncondition (i.e., positivity of energy density in all frames), then the only\neffect that small scale inhomogeneities can have on the dynamics of the\nbackground metric is to provide an \"effective stress-energy tensor\" that is\ntraceless and has positive energy density---corresponding to the presence of\ngravitational radiation. In particular, nonlinear effects produced by small\nscale inhomogeneities cannot mimic the effects of dark energy. We also develop\n\"perturbation theory\" off of the background metric. We derive an equation for\nthe \"long-wavelength part\" of the leading order deviation of the metric from\nthe background metric, which contains the usual terms occurring in linearized\nperturbation theory plus additional contributions from the small-scale\ninhomogeneities. Under various assumptions concerning the absence of\ngravitational radiation and the non-relativistic behavior of the matter, we\nargue that the \"short wavelength\" deviations of the metric from the background\nmetric near a point $x$ should be accurately described by Newtonian gravity,\ntaking into account only the matter lying within a \"homogeneity lengthscale\" of\n$x$.

Namely, these\nmodifications will take the guise of additional gauge and scalar fields for the\nso-called Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories with an exponential Liouville\npotential; and of extra spatial dimensions for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories.\nThe black-hole solutions of EMD theories as well as their integrability are\nreviewed. One of the main results is that a master equation is obtained in the\ncase of planar horizon topology, which allows to completely integrate the\nproblem for s special relationship between the couplings. We also classify\nexisting solutions. We move on to the study of Gauss-Bonnet black holes,\nfocusing on the six-dimensional case. It is found that the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling exposes the Weyl tensor of the horizon to the dynamics, severely\nrestricting the Einstein spaces admissible and effectively lifting some of the\ndegeneracy on the horizon topology. We then turn to the study of the\nthermodynamic properties of black holes, in General Relativity as well as in\nEMD theories. For the latter, phase transitions may be found in the canonical\nensemble, which resemble the phase transitions for Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nholes. Generically, we find that the thermodynamic properties (stability, order\nof phase transitions) depend crucially on the values of the EMD coupling\nconstants. Finally, we interpret our planar EMD solutions holographically as\nInfra-Red geometries through the AdS/CFT correspondence, taking into account\nvarious validity constraints.

The partition of gas into different thermal components must itself\ndepend on the star formation rate, since a steady state distribution requires a\nbalance between heating (largely from stellar UV for the atomic component) and\ncooling. In this presentation, I discuss a simple thermal and dynamical\nequilibrium model for the star formation rate in disk galaxies, where the basic\ninputs are the total surface density of gas and the volume density of stars and\ndark matter, averaged over ~kpc scales. Galactic environment is important\nbecause the vertical gravity of the stars and dark matter compress gas toward\nthe midplane, helping to establish the pressure, and hence the cooling rate. In\nequilibrium, the star formation rate must evolve until the gas heating rate is\nhigh enough to balance this cooling rate and maintain the pressure imposed by\nthe local gravitational field. In addition to discussing the formulation of\nthis equilibrium model, I review the current status of numerical simulations of\nmultiphase disks, focusing on measurements of quantities that characterize the\nmean properties of the diffuse ISM. Based on simulations, turbulence levels in\nthe diffuse ISM appear relatively insensitive to local disk conditions and\nenergetic driving rates, consistent with observations. It remains to be\ndetermined, both from observations and simulations, how mass exchange processes\ncontrol the ratio of cold-to-warm gas in the atomic ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 21:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Closing this gap has been open for over 20 years. The best known\napproximation factors are achieved by LP-based algorithms.

Based on this\nENA production model, it is then shown that the sensitivities of the IBEX 1.1\nkeV skymaps are sufficient to detect the variations in ENA fluxes that are\nexpected to accompany the solar transition into the next upwind cloud.\nApproximately 20% of the IBEX 1.1 keV pixels appear capable of detecting the\npredicted model differences at the $ 3 \\sigma$ level, with these pixels\nconcentrated in the Ribbon region. Regardless of the detailed ENA production\nmodel, the success of the modeled \\BdotR\\ directions in reproducing the Ribbon\nlocus, together with our results, indicate that the Ribbon phenomenon traces\nthe variations in the heliosphere distortion caused by the relative pressures\nof the interstellar magnetic and gaseous components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 22:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We examine the accuracy of SHAM in two cosmological SPH\nsimulations, one of which includes momentum-driven winds. The SPH simulations\nindeed show a nearly monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo mass\nprovided that, for satellite galaxies, we use the mass of the subhalo at the\nepoch when it became a satellite. In each simulation, the median relation for\ncentral and satellite galaxies is nearly identical, though a somewhat larger\nfraction of satellites are outliers. SHAM-assigned masses (at z=0-2),\nluminosities (R-band at z=0), or star formation rates (at z=2) have a 68%\nscatter of 0.09-0.15 dex relative to the true simulation values. When we apply\nSHAM to the subhalo population of collisionless N-body simulation with the same\ninitial conditions as the SPH runs, we find generally good agreement for the\nhalo occupation distributions and halo radial profiles of galaxy samples\ndefined by thresholds in stellar mass. However, because a small fraction of SPH\ngalaxies suffer severe stellar mass loss after becoming satellites, SHAM\nslightly overpopulates high mass halos; this effect is more significant for the\nwind simulation, which produces galaxies that are less massive and more\nfragile. SHAM recovers the two-point correlation function of the SPH galaxies\nin the no-wind simulation to better than 10% at scales 0.1 < r < 10 Mpc/h.

Both distributions decay to zero for time\nintervals close to zero. But this feature contradicts the high immediate\naftershock level according to Omori's law. We propose that these statistical\ndistributions are influenced by the power-law stress distribution near the\nearthquake focal zone and we derive new distributions as a mixture of power-law\nstress with the exponent psi and Levy as well as IGD distributions. Such new\ndistributions describe the resulting inter-earthquake time intervals and\nclosely resemble Omori's law.

From the visual time-series\nphotometric observations by the ASAS and MACHO projects which cover nearly 8-10\nyears, the period and amplitude of light variation are analyzed carefully using\nboth the PDM and Period04 methods. According to the properties of light\nvariation, these objects are classified into five categories: (1) 20 objects\nare saturated in photometry or located in crowded stellar field with poor\nphotometric results, (2) 35 objects with too complex variation to have any\ncertain period, (3) 23 objects with irregular variation, (4) 16 objects with\nsemi-regular variation, and (5) 95 objects with Long Secondary Period (LSP)\namong which 31 have distinguishable short period, and 51 have a long period\nshorter than 3000 days that can be determined with reasonable accuracy. For the\nsemi-regular variables and the LSP variables with distinguishable short period,\nthe period-luminosity relation is analyzed in the visual, near-infrared and\nmid-infrared bands.

In this paper, motivated by the fairness concept\nof congestion control, we firstly propose a new generic objective function,\nwhere various interests of providers can be extracted with different parameter\nsettings. And then, we model the optimal TE as the utility maximization of\nmulti-commodity flows with the generic objective function and theoretically\nshow that any given set of optimal routes corresponding to a particular\nobjective function can be converted to shortest paths with respect to a set of\npositive link weights. This can be directly configured on OSPF-based protocols.\nOn these bases, we employ the Network Entropy Maximization(NEM) framework and\ndevelop a new OSPF-based routing protocol, SPEF, to realize a flexible way to\nsplit traffic over shortest paths in a distributed fashion. Actually, comparing\nto OSPF, SPEF only needs one more weight for each link and provably achieves\noptimal TE.

Coarsening of the system, when quenched from a dis-\nordered state to zero temperature, is observed to be enhanced by the existence\nof the mode coupling terms.

In this paper more than sixty curves with large ultraviolet deviations\nfrom their best-fit one parameter curve are analyzed.

Such curves represent the larger and homogeneous\nsample of anomalous curves studied so far with dust models.

It follows\nthat Boussinesq and anelastic fluids admit explicit compressible effects and\nconversions between internal energy and mechanical energy, under the form of\napparent changes in gravitational potential energy resulting from changes in\ndensity by diabatic and adiabatic effects. From the knowledge of $\\delta\nW_{ba}$, the corresponding approximation to the \"heat\" $\\delta Q_{ba}$ can be\nconstructed in a consistent way by requiring that the Maxwell relationships be\nsatisfied, ultimately leading to the construction of a well defined\napproximation to the internal energy and ultimately of the full range of known\nthermodynamic potentials. These properties make it possible to endow common\nforms of the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations with fully consistent\nenergetics and thermodynamics, even when diabatic effects and an arbitrary\nnonlinear equation of state for a binary fluid are retained, without loss of\naccuracy. In that case, it can be shown that the sum of kinetic energy and\nenthalpy is a conservative quantity, which plays the role of the total energy\nin the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations for both diabatic and adiabatic\nmotions. This implies that gravitational potential energy can be regarded as\nthe difference between enthalpy and internal energy, and hence as a pure\nthermodynamic property of the fluid.\n  The results have implications for our understanding of turbulent mixing in\nstratified fluids, as well as for correcting the energetics of current\nnumerical ocean general circulation models, which are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 12:03:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 14:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 09:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-22"}

These sensor\nnodes are mainly in large numbers and are densely deployed either inside the\nphenomenon or very close to it. They can be used for various application areas\n(e.g. health, military, home). Failures are inevitable in wireless sensor\nnetworks due to inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. Therefore,\nit is necessary that network failures are detected in advance and appropriate\nmeasures are taken to sustain network operation. We previously proposed a\ncellular approach for fault detection and recovery. In this paper we extend the\ncellular approach and propose a new fault management mechanism to deal with\nfault detection and recovery. We propose a hierarchical structure to properly\ndistribute fault management tasks among sensor nodes by introducing more\n'self-managing' functions. The proposed failure detection and recovery\nalgorithm has been compared with some existing related work and proven to be\nmore energy efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 12:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

In structured populations the array of those that\nare eligible to act as strategy sources is bounded to the immediate neighbors\nof each individual. But which one of these strategy sources should potentially\nbe copied? Previous research dealt with this question either by selecting the\nfittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. Here we introduce a\nparameter $u$ that interpolates between these two extreme options. Setting $u$\nequal to zero returns the random selection of the opponent, while positive $u$\nfavor the fitter players. In addition, we divide the population into two\ngroups. Players from group $A$ select their opponents as dictated by the\nparameter $u$, while players from group $B$ do so randomly irrespective of $u$.\nWe denote the fraction of players contained in groups $A$ and $B$ by $v$ and\n$1-v$, respectively. The two parameters $u$ and $v$ allow us to analyze in\ndetail how aspirations in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game influence\nthe evolution of cooperation. We find that for sufficiently positive values of\n$u$ there exist a robust intermediate $v \\approx 0.5$ for which cooperation\nthrives best. The robustness of this observation is tested against different\nlevels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process $K$ and for different\ninteraction networks. We also provide complete phase diagrams depicting the\ndependence of the impact of $u$ and $v$ for different values of $K$, and\ncontrast the validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model where\nindividual aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. Our study\nindicates that heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainability\nof cooperation in structured populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 15:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

It has been observed in computer simulations that\nimposing a torque at the contacts modifies the force chains, making support\nchains less important. In this work we investigate the effect of a gradual\nhindering of the grains rotations on the so-called critical state of soil\nmechanics. The critical state is an asymptotic state independent of the initial\nsolid fraction where deformations occur at a constant shear strength and\ncompactness. We quantify the difficulty to rotate by a friction coefficient at\nthe level of particles, acting like a threshold. We explore the effect of this\nparticle-level friction coefficient on the critical state by means of molecular\ndynamics simulations of a simple shear test on a poly-disperse sphere packing.\nWe found that the larger the difficulty to rotate, the larger the final shear\nstrength of the sample. Other micro-mechanical variables, like the structural\nanisotropy and the distribution of forces, are also influenced by the\nthreshold. These results reveal the key role of rotations on the critical\nbehavior of soils and suggest the inclusion of rotational variables into their\nconstitutive equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 15:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

If Vega were a normal, equator-on,\nslow-rotating star, then its spectrum and our analysis would indicate a\ntemperature of Teff ~ 9550 K, surface gravity of log g ~ 3.7, general surface\nmetallicity of [m/H] ~ -0.5, and a microturbulence velocity of v(turb) ~ 2.0\nkm/s. Given its rapid rotation and nearly pole-on orientation, however, these\nparameters must be regarded as representing averages across the observed\nhemisphere. Modeling the complex UV line spectrum has allowed us to determine\nthe specific surface abundances for 17 different chemical elements, including\nCNO, the light metals, and the iron group elements. The resultant abundance\npattern agrees in general with previous results, although there is considerable\nscatter in the literature. Despite its peculiarities, Vega has turned out to\nprovide a powerful test of the extent of our abilities to model the atmospheric\nproperties of the early A-stars, particularly the detailed UV line spectrum.\nThe value of the measurements from this pilot study will increase as this\nanalysis is extended to more objects in the rich high-dispersion IUE data\narchive, including both normal and peculiar objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 15:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Cosmological effects on a\nquantum system can be explored in one approach by considering an object at rest\nin space with a universal Hubble expansion taking place away from it, and\ndeveloping a Schroedinger type governing differential equation incorporating an\nintrinsic expansion speed. Wave function solutions to this governing equation\nexhibit pronounced central localization. The extent of concentration of\nprobability depends on mass; objects with small masses tend to behave in a\ndelocalized manner as ordinary quantum objects do in a static space, while\nquantum objects with large masses are concentrated into much smaller regions.\nTo develop a criterion for classicality, we consider that if the size of the\nlocalized region of concentrated probability density is larger than the size of\nthe corresponding extended object, then quantum behavior could be expected;\nwhereas if the region of high probability density for the location of the\ncenter of mass is smaller than the size of the object, the object would behave\nin a more classical manner. The resultant size threshold for classicality\naccords with results of other studies examining these issues based on\nuncertainty relations and wave packets. This size threshold is informative for\nthe case of compact extended objects and, as the constraint applies to the\ncenter of mass of the system, does not lead to inconsistencies for quantum\ncorrelations between distant entangled quantum objects. While local decoherence\nmay lead to classicality under a variety of conditions, cosmologically induced\nclassicality would appear to cause fundamental limitations on quantum behavior\nin our universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 20:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-25"}
