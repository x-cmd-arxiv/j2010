The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet\naround a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement\nuncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs. This requires\nrelying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise. Artifacts\nintroduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine\nplanets that should be easily detected otherwise. Here we discuss a\nparticularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly\naliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet. This\nproblem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection\nof a 3.1 Earth mass planet candidate in the habitable zone of the nearby low\nmass star GJ 581. The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g)\ncorresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously\nreported planet, GJ 581d. Although the star is stable, the combination of the\nobserving cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period\nmisinterpretations. In this work, we determine whether the detection of GJ 581g\nis justified given this degeneracy. We also discuss the implications of our\nanalysis for the recent Bayesian studies of the same data set, which failed to\nconfirm the existence of the new planet. Performing a number of statistical\ntests, we show that, despite some caveats, the existence of GJ 581g remains the\nmost likely orbital solution to the currently available RV data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2010 18:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 20:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-03"}

For the\nfirst time, we collect and compile the recent laboratory experiments on dust\naggregates into a collision model that can be implemented into dust coagulation\nmodels. We put this model into a Monte Carlo code that uses representative\nparticles to simulate dust evolution. Simulations are performed using three\ndifferent disk models in a local box (0D) located at 1 AU distance from the\ncentral star. We find that the dust evolution does not follow the previously\nassumed growth-fragmentation cycle, but growth is halted by bouncing before the\nfragmentation regime is reached. We call this the bouncing barrier which is an\nadditional obstacle during the already complex formation process of\nplanetesimals. The absence of the growth-fragmentation cycle and the halted\ngrowth has two important consequences for planet formation. 1) It is observed\nthat disk atmospheres are dusty throughout their lifetime. Previous models\nconcluded that the small, continuously produced fragments can keep the disk\natmospheres dusty. We however show that small fragments are not produced\nbecause bouncing prevents fragmentation. 2) As particles do not reach the\nfragmentation barrier, their sizes are smaller compared to the sizes reached in\nprevious dust models.

The amount of mass converted into large protoplanets and their\nresulting size distribution are not well understood. Here, we use analytic\nwork, that we confirm by coagulation simulations, to describe runaway growth\nand the corresponding evolution of the velocity dispersion. We find that\nrunaway growth proceeds as follows: Initially all the mass resides in small\nplanetesimals, with mass surface density \\sigma, and large protoplanets start\nto form by accreting small planetesimals. This growth continues until growth by\nmerging large protoplanets becomes comparable to growth by planetesimal\naccretion. This condition sets in when \\Sigma/\\sigma ~\\alpha^{3/4} ~ 10^{-3},\nwhere \\Sigma is the mass surface density in protoplanets in a given logarithmic\nmass interval and \\alpha is the ratio of the size of a body to its Hill radius.\nFrom then on, protoplanetary growth and the evolution of the velocity\ndispersion become self-similar and \\Sigma remains roughly constant, since an\nincrease in \\Sigma by accretion of small planetesimals is balanced by a\ndecrease due to merging with large protoplanets. We show that this growth leads\nto a protoplanet size distribution given by N(>R) \\propto R^{-3} where N(>R) is\nthe number of objects with radii greater than R (i.e., a differential power-law\nindex of 4). We apply our results to the Kuiper Belt, which is a relic of\nrunaway growth. Our results successfully match the observed Kuiper belt size\ndistribution, they illuminate the physical processes that shaped it and explain\nthe total mass that is present in large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) today. This\nwork suggests that the current mass in large KBOs is primordial and that it has\nnot been significantly depleted.

However, during the\nemission process, most related observations have not incorporated the effects\nof back reaction on the background spacetime, whose derivations are therefore\nnot the desiring results for the real physical process. With this point as a\ncentral motivation, in this paper we suitably adapt the \\emph{reformulated}\ntunneling framework so that it can well accommodate the effects of back\nreaction to produce the Hawking emission spectrum and entropy spectroscopy.\nConsequently, we interestingly find that, when back reaction is considered, the\nParikh-Wilczek's outstanding observations that, an isolated radiating black\nhole has an unitary-evolving emission spectrum that is \\emph{not} precisely\nthermal, but is related to the change of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can\nalso be reproduced in the reformulated tunneling framework, meanwhile the\nentropy spectrum has the same form as that without inclusion of back reaction,\nwhich demonstrates the entropy quantum is \\emph{independent} of the effects of\nback reaction. As our final analysis, we concentrate on the issues of the black\nhole information, but \\emph{unfortunately} find that, even including the\neffects of back reaction and higher-order quantum corrections, such tunneling\nformalism can still not provide a mechanism for preserving the black hole\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 04:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

Recently, there has been a\ngrowing trend for many governments to supplement public ownership and\nmanagement of reserves with incentive programs for conservation on private\nland. At the same time, policies to promote conservation on private land are\nrarely evaluated in terms of their ecological consequences. This raises\nimportant questions, such as the extent to which private land conservation can\nimprove conservation outcomes, and how it should be mixed with more traditional\npublic land conservation. We address these questions, using a general framework\nfor modelling environmental policies and a case study examining the\nconservation of endangered native grasslands to the west of Melbourne,\nAustralia. Specifically, we examine three policies that involve: i) spending\nall resources on creating public conservation areas; ii) spending all resources\non an ongoing incentive program where private landholders are paid to manage\nvegetation on their property with 5-year contracts; and iii) splitting\nresources between these two approaches. The performance of each strategy is\nquantified with a vegetation condition change model that predicts future\nchanges in grassland quality. Of the policies tested, no one policy was always\nbest and policy performance depended on the objectives of those enacting the\npolicy. This work demonstrates a general method for evaluating environmental\npolicies and highlights the utility of a model which combines ecological and\nsocioeconomic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 04:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

Systematic mortality risk is due to the uncertain\ndevelopment of future mortality intensities, or {\\it hazard rates}. In this\npaper, we develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a\nmortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure\nendowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are\ncorrelated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment\nby assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality\nforward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality\nrisk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. The major\nresult of this paper is that the value per contract solves a linear partial\ndifferential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can\nrepresent the limiting price as an expectation under an equivalent martingale\nmeasure. Another important result is that hedging with the mortality forward\nmay raise or lower the price of this pure endowment comparing to its price\nwithout hedging, as determined in Bayraktar et al. [2009]. The market price of\nthe reference mortality risk and the correlation between the two portfolios\njointly determine the cost of hedging.

Currently, it remains unresolved whether the algorithm\ncan be modified to compute an exact correlated equilibrium.

At low stellar mass, metallicity decreases sharply with\nincreasing SFR, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not depend on SFR.\nThe residual metallicity dispersion across this Fundamental Metallicity\nRelation (FMR) is very small, about 0.05dex. High redshift galaxies, up to\nz~2.5, are found to follow the same FMR defined by local SDSS galaxies, with no\nindication of evolution.

We combine density-functional with various\nscale-bridging tools to establish correlations between the macroscopic\nproperties and the atomic structure of materials. For examples, magnetic memory\ndevices exploiting the tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) effect depend\ncrucially on the spin polarization of the electrodes. Heusler alloys, e.g.\nCo2MnSi, if perfectly ordered, are ferromagnetic half-metals with (ideally)\n100% spin polarization. Their performance as electrodes in TMR devices is\nlimited by atomic disorder and deviations from perfect stoichiometry, but also\nby interface states at the tunneling barrier. We use ab initio thermodynamics\nin conjunction with the cluster expansion technique to show that excess\nmanganese in the alloy and at the interface helps to preserve the desired\nhalf-metallic property. As another example, nanostructured materials with a\nreduced thermal conductivity but good electrical conductivity are sought for\napplications in thermoelectrics. Semiconductor heterostructures with a regular\narrangement of nanoscale inclusions ('quantum dot superlattices') hold the\npromise of a high thermoelectric figure of merit. Our theoretical analysis\nreveals that an increased figure of merit is to be expected if the quantum dot\nsize, the superlattice period and the doping level are all suitably fine-tuned.\nSuch a superlattice thus constitutes a material whose transport properties are\ncontrolled by geometrical features at the nanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 14:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

The cluster is\ndetected with a peak SNR ratio of 13 sigma in the radio source subtracted map.\nComparison of the SZ and X-ray images suggests that they both have extended\nregions which lie approximately perpendicular to one another, with their\nemission peaks significantly displaced.

We use a Bayesian cluster analysis to explore\nthe high-dimensional parameter space of the cluster-plus-sources model to\nobtain cluster parameter estimates in the presence of radio point sources,\nreceiver noise and primordial CMB anisotropy; the probability of SZ + CMB\nprimordial structure + radio sources + receiver noise to CMB + radio sources +\nreceiver noise is 3 x 10^{6}:1.

Most of these young stars have\nhighly eccentric orbits, and were probably not formed in-situ. It has been\nproposed that these stars acquired their current orbits from the tidal\ndisruption of compact massive binaries scattered toward the proximity of the\ncentral supermassive black hole. Assuming a binary star formed in a thin\ngaseous disk beyond 0.1 pc from the central object, we investigate the\nrelevance of disk-satellite interactions to harden the binding energy of the\nbinary, and to drive its inward migration. A massive, equal-mass binary star is\nfound to become more tightly wound as it migrates inwards toward the central\nblack hole. The migration timescale is very similar to that of a single-star\nsatellite of the same mass. The binary's hardening is caused by the formation\nof spiral tails lagging the stars inside the binary's Hill radius. We show that\nthe hardening timescale is mostly determined by the mass of gas inside the\nbinary's Hill radius, and that it is much shorter than the migration timescale.\nWe discuss some implications of the binary's hardening process. When the more\nmassive (primary) components of close binaries eject most their mass through\nsupernova explosion, their secondary stars may attain a range of eccentricities\nand inclinations. Such processes may provide an alternative unified scenario\nfor the origin of the kinematic properties of the central cluster and S-stars\nin the Galactic center as well as the high velocity stars in the Galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 15:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
