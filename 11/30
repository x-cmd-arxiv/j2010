Or do they in fact make things worse? Just like medicine regulatory\nmeasures in financial markets aim at improving an already complex system. And\njust like medicine these interventions can cause side effects which are even\nharder to assess when taking the interplay with other measures into account. In\nthis paper an agent based stock market model is built that tries to find\nanswers to the questions above. In a stepwise procedure regulatory measures are\nintroduced and their implications on market liquidity and stability examined.\nParticularly, the effects of (i) a ban of short selling (ii) a mandatory risk\nlimit, i.e. a Value-at-Risk limit, (iii) an introduction of a Tobin Tax, i.e.\ntransaction tax on trading, and (iv) any arbitrary combination of the measures\nare observed and discussed. The model is set up to incorporate non-linear\nfeedback effects of leverage and liquidity constraints leading to fire sales\nand escape dynamics. In its unregulated version the model outcome is capable of\nreproducing stylised facts of asset returns like fat tails and clustered\nvolatility. Introducing regulatory measures shows that only a mandatory risk\nlimit is beneficial from every perspective, while a short selling ban - though\nreducing volatility - increases tail risk. The contrary holds true for a Tobin\nTax: it reduces the occurrence of crashes but increases volatility.\nFurthermore, the interplay of measures is not negligible: measures block each\nother and a well chosen combination can mitigate unforeseen side effects.\nConcerning the Tobin Tax the findings indicate that an overdose can do severe\nharm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 16:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 07:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

In the first model, associated with the\ncytochrome c oxidase complex in the inner mitochondria membranes, the\nelectrostatic coupling to the site occupied by an electron lowers the energy\nlevel of the proton-binding site, making the proton transfer possible. In the\nsecond model, roughly describing the redox loop in a nitrate respiration of E.\ncoli bacteria, an electron displaces a proton from the negative side of the\nmembrane to a shuttle, which subsequently diffuses across the membrane and\nunloads the proton to its positive side. We show that both models can be\ndescribed by the same approach, which can be significantly simplified if the\nsystem is separated into several clusters, with strong Coulomb interaction\ninside each cluster and weak transfer couplings between them. We derive and\nsolve the equations of motion for the electron and proton creation/annihilation\noperators, taking into account the appropriate Coulomb terms, tunnel couplings,\nand the interaction with the environment.

We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (SF)\nthat shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame\noptical SED. At 0.2<z<3 both populations show a strong and M_*-independent\ndecrease in their SSFR towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,\nwhere n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for SF sources. The decrease appears to\nhave started at z>2, at least above 4x10^10M_Sun where our conclusions are most\nrobust. We find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR (M_*)^beta,\nbetween SSFR and M_* at all z. It tends to flatten below ~10^10M_Sun if\nquiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_SFG\n-0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher M_* objects always have lower\nSSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an\nupper SSFR-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. It is suggested by a\nflattening of the SSFR-M_* relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive\n(>10^10M_Sun) galaxies only at the highest z. Below z=1.5 there thus is no\ndirect evidence that galaxies of higher M_* experience a more rapid waning of\ntheir SSFR than lower M_* SF systems.

First, the structure of the\nequations of motion underlying black hole solutions is considered, in theories\nof D-dimensional gravity coupled to scalars and vectors. For solutions\npreserving supersymmetry, the equations of motion have a dramatic\nsimplification: they become first-order instead of the second-order equations\none would expect. Recently, it was found that this is a feature some\nnon-supersymmetric black hole solutions exhibit as well. We investigate if this\nholds more generally, by examining what the conditions are to have first-order\nequations for the scalar fields of non-supersymmetric black holes, that mimic\nthe form of their supersymmetric counterparts. This is illustrated in examples.\nSecond, the structure of black holes themselves is investigated. String theory\nhas been successful in explaining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for (mainly\nsupersymmetric) black holes from a microscopic perspective. However, it is not\nfully established what the interpretation of the corresponding 'microstates'\nshould be in the gravitational description where the black hole picture is\nvalid. There have been recent advances to understand the nature of black hole\nmicrostates in the gravity regime, such as the fuzzball proposal. A related\nidea says that black hole configurations with multiple centers are related to\nmicrostates of single-centered black holes. We report on work relating both\npictures. As an aside, a relation between violations of causality for certain\nspacetimes (presence of closed timelike curves in the geometry) and a breakdown\nof unitarity in the dual conformal field theory is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 21:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

It is also given numerically for specific potential shapes as an\nexpansion in powers of $x_0$ up to the second order. We show that, for a\nharmonic trap, the well known first order shift of the critical temperature\n$\\Delta T_c/T_c \\propto N^{-1/3}$ is inaccurate when $N \\leqslant 10^{5}$, the\nnext order (proportional to $N^{-1/2}$) being significant. We also show that\nfinite size effects on the condensation temperature cancel out in a cubic\ntrapping potential, e.g. $V(\\mathbi{r}) \\propto r^3$. Finally, we show that in\na generic power-law potential of higher order, e.g. $V(\\mathbi{r}) \\propto\nr^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha > 3$, the shift of the critical temperature becomes\npositive. This effect provides a large increase of $T_c$ for relatively small\natom numbers. For instance, an increase of about +40% is expected with $10^4$\natoms in a $V(\\mathbi{r}) \\propto r^{12}$ trapping potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 08:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 07:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

For evaluation of the undrained thermo-poro-elastic\nproperties of saturated porous materials in conventional triaxial cells, it is\nimportant to take into account the effect of the dead volume of the drainage\nsystem.

The statistical\ndistribution in logarithmic period-duration space indicates that QPPs can be\nclassified into two groups: group I includes VLP, LPP, SPP and part of\nslow-VSPs distributed around a line approximately; group II includes fast-VSP\nand most of slow-VSP dispersively distributed away from the above line.

We construct a purely gravitational theoretical model of perfectly\ncollimated jets of high energy particles in the ideal case where the central\nengine is a Kerr BH of mass $M$ and angular momentum by unit of mass $a$. We\nstudy in Weyl coordinates ($\\rho $, $z$) the unbound Kerr 2D-geodesics which\nare asymptotes to straight lines parallel to the $z$ axis of equations \\rho\n=constant= \\rho_{1}= [(a/M)^2+Q/(E^2-1)]^{1/2} of which existence was recently\ndemonstrated (Gariel et al.,A & A, 2010). On these geodesics, flow test\nparticles of energy $E$, with a Carter constant $Q$ and (necessarily) an\nangular momentum $L_{z}=0$. Studying the characteristics of the geodesics\nequations system, in the special case of a double root, we exhibit jets with a\nradial structure, whose energy flux can be calculated. From the observed data\nof the jet powers, we obtain the mean particles density, the particles flow,\nthe speed and the Lorentz factor of the jets, for any charged or neutral test\nparticle. Then, we numerically apply these results to electrons. We also\ndiscuss the domains of initial conditions for geodesics starting inside the\nergosphere.

We find the progenitor to have\nan absolute magnitude of $V = -4.63^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ mag and a colour of $V-I =\n2.29^{+0.25}_{-0.39}$ mag, corresponding to a progenitor luminosity of log\n$L$/L$_{\\odot}$ $\\sim4.54\\pm0.19$ dex. Using the stellar evolution code STARS,\nwe find this to be consistent with a red supergiant progenitor with $M =\n8.5_{-1.5}^{+6.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The photometric and spectroscopic evolution of\nSN 2009md is similar to that of the class of sub-luminous Type IIP SNe; in this\npaper we compare the evolution of SN 2009md primarily to that of the\nsub-luminous SN 2005cs.

In conclusion, SN 2009md is a faint SN\narising from the collapse of a progenitor close to the lower mass limit for\ncore-collapse. This is now the third discovery of a low mass progenitor star\nproducing a low energy explosion and low $^{56}$Ni ejected mass, which\nindicates that such events arise from the lowest end of the mass range that\nproduces a core-collapse supernova (7-8 M$_{\\odot}$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 14:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This\ntheoretical prediction is now confirmed by interferometric observations of fast\nrotating stars.} Polar winds remove less angular momentum than spherical winds\nand thus allow the star to keep more angular momentum. We quantitatively assess\nthe importance of this effect.\n  First we use a semi-analytical approach to estimate the variation of the\nangular momentum loss when the rotation parameter increases. Then we compute\ncomplete 9 MSun stellar models at very high angular velocities (starting on the\nZAMS with Omega/Omega_crit = 0.8 and reaching the critical velocity during the\nMain Sequence) with and without radiative wind anisotropies.\n  When wind anisotropies are accounted for, the angular momentum loss rate is\nreduced by less than 4% for Omega/Omega_crit < 0.9 with respect to the case of\nspherical winds. The reduction amounts to at most 30% when the star is rotating\nnear the critical velocity. These values result from two counteracting effects:\non the one hand polar winds reduce the loss of angular momentum, on the other\nhand, surface deformations imply that the mass which is lost at high\nco-latitude is lost at a larger distance from the rotational axis and thus\nremoves more angular momentum.\n  In contrast with previous studies, which neglected surface deformations, we\nshow that the radiative wind anisotropies have a relatively modest effect on\nthe evolution of the angular momentum content of fast rotating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 15:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 08:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This\nprocess is particularly interesting as the subsequent K1 decay into its three\nbody final state allows us to determine the polarization of the photon, which\nis mostly left- (right-)handed for Bbar (B) in the SM while various new physics\nmodels predict additional right- (left-)handed components. A new method is\nproposed to determine the polarization, exploiting the full Dalitz plot\ndistribution, which seems to reduce significantly the statistical errors. This\npolarization measurement requires however a detailed knowledge of the K1--> K\npi pi strong interaction decays, namely, the various partial wave amplitudes\ninto the several possible quasi two-body channels, as well as their relative\nphases. The pattern of partial waves is especially complex for the K1(1270).

While retaining the Lagrangian character of\ngeneral relativity, the new theory provides a natural alternative to the view\nthat the singularity is inevitable in general relativity and in the theory of a\nhot Universe. We show that the macroscopic source-sink motion of the ordinary\n(dark) matter during production-absorption of particles by vacuum generates\npolarization (determining the variability of the cosmological term in general\nrelativity). We have removed the well-known problems of the cosmological\nconstant by refining the physical nature of dark energy associated precisely\nwith this hydrodynamically initiated variability of the vacuum energy density.\nA new exact solution of the modified general relativity equations that contains\nno free (fitting) parameter (additional to thouse available in general\nrelativity) has been obtained. It corresponds to continuous and\nmetric-affecting production of ultralight dark matter particles out of vacuum,\nwith its density being retaned constant during the expansion of spatially flat\nUniverse. This solution is shown to be stable in the regime of cosmological\nexpansion untill Tmax about 38 billion years. After that time, the solution\nbecomes unstable and characterizes the inverse process of dark matter particles\nabsorption by the vacuum in the regime of contraction of the Universe. The\nphysical nature of dark matter particles is considered and their mass is\nestimated. Good quantitative agreement of the indicated exact solution with\ncosmological observations (SnIa, SDSS-BAO and recently found reduction of\nacceleration of the expanding Universe) has been obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 02:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}
