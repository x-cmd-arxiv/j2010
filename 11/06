We test the hypothesis that a first generation of\nlow-mass stars may heat the gas enough that subsequent thermal fragmentation\nresults in fragments >=10Msun, sufficient to form B stars. We combine ATCA and\nSMA observations of the massive star-forming region G8.68-0.37 with radiative\ntransfer modeling to derive the present-day conditions in the region and use\nthis to infer the conditions in the past, at the time of core formation.\nAssuming the current mass/separation of the observed cores equals the\nfragmentation Jeans mass/length and the region's average density has not\nchanged, requires the gas temperature to have been 100K at the time of\nfragmentation. The postulated first-generation of low-mass stars would still be\naround today, but the number required to heat the cloud exceeds the limits\nimposed by the observations. Several lines of evidence suggest the observed\ncores in the region should eventually form O stars yet none have sufficient raw\nmaterial. Even if feedback may have suppressed fragmentation, it was not\nsufficient to halt it to this extent. To develop into O stars, the cores must\nobtain additional mass from outside their observationally defined boundaries.\nThe observations suggest they are currently fed via infall from the very\nmassive reservoir (~1500Msun) of gas in the larger pc scale cloud around the\nstar-forming cores. This suggests that massive stars do not form in the\ncollapse of individual massive fragments, but rather in smaller fragments that\nthemselves continue to gain mass by accretion from larger scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 16:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

We conclude that our sample of black hole\nmasses provides strong evidence of a gap between the maximum neutron star mass\nand the lower bound on black hole masses. Our results on the low-mass sample\nare in qualitative agreement with those of Ozel, et al (2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 17:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 01:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this work, we evaluate the\nextent of the degeneracies in this process, systematically explore the\ndependence of TTV signals on several parameters and provide phase space plots\nthat could aid observers in planning future observations. Our explorations are\nfocused on a likely-to-be prevalent situation: a known transiting short-period\nNeptune or Jupiter-sized planet and a suspected external low-mass perturber on\na nearly-coplanar orbit. Through approximately 10^7 N-body simulations, we\ndemonstrate how TTV signal amplitudes may vary by orders of magnitude due to\nslight variations in any one orbital parameter (0.001 AU in semimajor axis,\n0.005 in eccentricity, or a few degrees in orbital angles), and quantify the\nnumber of consecutive transit observations necessary in order to obtain a\nreasonable opportunity to characterize the unseen planet (approximately greater\nor equal to 50 observations).

Extinction peaks in the Pipe\nNebula appear to have a spatial distribution similar to the stars in Taurus,\nsuggesting that the spatial distribution of stars evolves directly from the\nprimordial spatial distribution of high density material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 19:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

The peak height, usually taken to be well\nrepresented by the virial mass, can instead be approximated by the mass inside\nspheres of different radii, which in some cases can be larger than the virial\nradius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo. The sphere\nradii are defined as r = $a$ delta_t + $b$ log_10(M_vir/M_nl), where delta_t is\nthe age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial\nmass M_vir, M_nl is the non-linear mass, and $a$=0.2 and $b$=-0.02 are the free\nparameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect. Note that $r$ depends on\nboth halo mass and age. In this new approach, some of the objects which were\ninitially considered low-mass peaks belong to regions with higher\noverdensities. At large scales, i.e. in the two-halo regime, this model\nproperly recovers the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height\nof the mass peak alone, in contrast to the usual definition (virial mass) that\nshows a strong dependence on additional halo properties such as formation time.\nThe dependence on the age in the one-halo term is also remarkably reduced. The\npopulation of galaxies whose \"peak height\" changes with this new definition\nconsists mainly of old stellar populations and are preferentially hosted by\nlow-mass haloes located near more massive objects. The latter is in agreement\nwith recent results which indicate that old, low-mass haloes would suffer\ntruncation of mass accretion by nearby larger haloes or simply due to the high\ndensity of their surroundings, thus showing an assembly bias effect. The change\nin mass is small enough that the Sheth et al.

The overall rest-frame optical emission of the\ngalaxies is characterized by shallow profiles in general (Sersic index n<1),\nwith median effective radii of ~5kpc. The morphologies are significantly clumpy\nand irregular, which we quantify through a non-parametric morphological\napproach, estimating the Gini (G), Multiplicity (Psi), and M_20 coefficients.\nThe strength of the rest-frame optical emission lines in the F160W bandpass\nindicates that the observed structure is not dominated by the morphology of\nline-emitting gas, and must reflect the underlying stellar mass distribution of\nthe galaxies. The sizes and structural parameters in the rest-frame optical\ncontinuum and Halpha emission reveal no significant differences, suggesting\nsimilar global distributions of the on-going star formation and more evolved\nstellar population.

As more and more people become the active users of\nonline social networks, one may ponder questions such as: (1) Do OSNs indeed\nimprove our sociability? (2) To what extent can we expand our offline social\nspectrum in OSNs? (3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs?\nOur work in this paper just aims to answer these interesting questions. To this\nend, we pay a revisit to the well-known Dunbar's number in online social\nnetworks. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, to our best\nknowledge, our work is the first one that systematically validates the\nexistence of the online Dunbar's number in the range of [200,300]. To reach\nthis, we combine using local-structure analysis and user-interaction analysis\nfor extensive real-world OSNs. Second, we divide OSNs users into two\ncategories: rational and aggressive, and find that rational users intend to\ndevelop close and reciprocated relationships, whereas aggressive users have no\nconsistent behaviors. Third, we build a simple model to capture the constraints\nof time and cognition that affect the evolution of online social networks.\nFinally, we show the potential use of our findings in viral marketing and\nprivacy management in online social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2010 09:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09"}

We prove the\nequality of 3x3 minors and derive Geramita's conjecture as a consequence of\nprevious work by Kanev.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2010 15:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2011 03:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 May 2013 05:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

Several entropic measures have been proposed in\nthis respect. Here we study the relation between the Shannon entropy and the\nVon Neumann entropy of networks with a given expected degree sequence. We find\nin different examples of network topologies that when the degree distribution\ncontains some heterogeneity, an intriguing correlation emerges between the two\nentropies.

We formulate a distribution-free robust framework\nfor the rate-maximization game. We present the robust-optimization equilibrium\nfor this game and derive sufficient conditions for its existence and\nuniqueness. We show that an iterative waterfilling algorithm converges to this\nequilibrium under certain sufficient conditions. We analyse the social\nproperties of the equilibrium under varying channel uncertainty bounds for the\ntwo-user case. We also observe an interesting phenomenon that the equilibrium\nmoves towards a frequency-division multiple access solution for any set of\nchannel coefficients under increasing channel uncertainty bounds. We further\nprove that increasing channel uncertainty can lead to a more efficient\nequilibrium, and hence, a better sum rate in certain two-user communication\nsystems. Finally, we confirm, through simulations, this improvement in\nequilibrium efficiency is also observed in systems with a higher number of\nusers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2010 15:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2011 15:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
