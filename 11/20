However, guaranteeing that the output from a candidate\nrandom source could not have been predicted by an outside party is a\nchallenging task, and many supposedly random sources used today provide no such\nguarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which\ninternally sends a photon through a beam-splitter and observes on which side it\nemerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal\nworkings of the device. Here we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking\nwhether randomness can be generated using untrusted devices---even ones created\nby an adversarial agent---while providing a guarantee that no outside party\n(including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily seen to be\nimpossible unless the user has an initially private random string, the task we\ninvestigate here is private randomness expansion.\n  We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted\ndevices which is designed to take as input an initially private random string\nand produce as output a longer private random string. We point out that private\nrandomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable to attacks that can\nrender the initial string partially insecure, even though that string is used\nonly inside a secure laboratory; our protocol is designed to remove this\npreviously unconsidered vulnerability by privacy amplification. We also discuss\nextensions of our protocol designed to generate an arbitrarily long random\nstring from a finite initially private random string. The security of these\nprotocols against the most general attacks is left as an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 21:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2011 04:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

One of the simplest and\nextensively used impurity solvers, namely the iterated perturbation theory\napproach is reformulated to avoid problems such as analytic continuation of\nMatsubara frequency quantities or calculating multi-dimensional integrals,\nwhile taking full account of the very sharp structures in the Green's functions\nthat arise close to the Mott transitions and in the Mott insulator regime. We\ndemonstrate its viability for the half-filled Hubbard model. Previous known\nresults are reproduced within the present approach. The universal behavior of\nthe spectral functions in the Fermi liquid regime is emphasized, and adiabatic\ncontinuity to the non-interacting limit is demonstrated. The dc resistivity in\nthe metallic regime is known to be a non-monotonic function of temperature with\na `coherence peak'. This feature is shown to be a universal feature occurring\nat a temperature roughly equal to the low energy scale of the system. A\ncomparison to pressure dependent dc resistivity experiments on Selenium doped\nNiS$_2$ yields qualitatively good agreement. Resistivity hysteresis across the\nMott transition is shown to be described qualitatively within the present\nframework. A direct comparison of the thermal hysteresis observed in V$_2$O$_3$\nwith our theoretical results yields a value of the hopping integral, which we\nfind to be in the range estimated through first-principle methods. Finally, a\nsystematic study of optical conductivity is carried out and the changes in\nabsorption as a result of varying interaction strength and temperature are\nidentified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 07:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 09:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

PQT\nis a fully micro-realistic version of quantum theory that provides us with a\nvery natural possible solution to the fundamental wave/particle problem, and is\nfree of the severe defects of orthodox quantum theory (OQT) as a result. PQT\nmakes sense of the quantum world. PQT recovers all the empirical success of OQT\nand is, furthermore, empirically testable (although not as yet tested). I argue\nthat Einstein almost put forward this version of quantum theory in 1916/17 in\nhis papers on spontaneous and induced radiative transitions, but retreated from\ndoing so because he disliked the probabilistic character of the idea.\nSubsequently, the idea was overlooked because debates about quantum theory\npolarised into the Bohr/Heisenberg camp, which argued for the abandonment of\nrealism and determinism, and the Einstein/Schr\\\"odinger camp, which argued for\nthe retention of realism and determinism, no one, as a result, pursuing the\nmost obvious option of retaining realism but abandoning determinism. It is this\nthird, overlooked option that leads to PQT. PQT has implications for quantum\nfield theory, the standard model, string theory, and cosmology. The really\nimportant point, however, is that it is experimentally testable. I indicate two\nexperiments in principle capable of deciding between PQT and OQT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

These observations suggest that the emission in these two\nbands has its origin in a single particle population. We aim at improving our\nunderstanding of the source behaviour by explaining the simultaneous X-ray and\nVHE data through a radiation model. We use a model based on a one zone\npopulation of relativistic leptonic particles assuming dominant adiabatic\nlosses located at the position of the compact object.

Coherent periodic fluctuation in origination/extinction of marine\ngenera that survive <45 million years is the source of an observed ~62 million\nyear periodicity analyzed in Paper I. We also show that the evolutionary\ndynamics of \"long-lived\" genera (those that survive >45 million years) do not\nparticipate in the periodic fluctuation in diversity and differ from those of\n\"short-lived\" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these\n2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of\nvariation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two\npreviously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in\nabundance of \"long-lived\" genera, is probably the source of heretofore\nunexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and\npost-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr\ncycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the\nPhanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal\nin sedimentary rock packages, particularly carbonates, which suggests a\nconnection.

This article shows the first evidence for gravitational lensing\nphenomena in high energy gamma-rays. This evidence comes from the observation\nof a gravitational lens induced echo in the light curve of the distant blazar\nPKS 1830-211. Methods. Traditional methods for the estimation of time delays in\ngravitational lensing systems rely on the cross-correlation of the light curves\nof the individual images. In this paper, we use 300 MeV-30 GeV photons detected\nby the Fermi-LAT instrument. The Fermi-LAT instrument cannot separate the\nimages of known lenses. The observed light curve is thus the superposition of\nindividual image light curves. The Fermi-LAT instrument has the advantage of\nproviding long, evenly spaced, time series. In addition, the photon noise level\nis very low. This allows to use directly Fourier transform methods. Results. A\ntime delay between the two compact images of PKS 1830-211 has been searched for\nboth by the autocorrelation method and the \"double power spectrum\" method. The\ndouble power spectrum shows a 3 {\\sigma} evidence for a time delay of 27.5\n$\\pm$ 1.3 days, consistent with the result from Lovell et al. (1998).

The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that\nthe relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence\nof intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two\nsubsamples split by v_Si (defined as \"Normal\" and \"High-Velocity\"). We verify\nthis result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when\nextremely reddened events (E(B-V) > 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that\n(1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ~0.06 mag to the red from the\nNormal subsample in the (B_max - V_max) - M_V plane, (2) the B_max - V_max\ncumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical\nshapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ~0.07 mag to the red in\nB_max - V_max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are ~0.10 mag redder\nthan the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference\nin intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color\ndifference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag\nfor SNe Ia with A_V < 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag\nby exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this\nresult can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R_V found\nin large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and\ncolor as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to\nbecome redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the\nimportance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular\nfocus on the design of WFIRST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Up to redshift z=0.6, we find 18\nphotometrically-identified subluminous SNe Ia, of which six have spectroscopic\nredshift (and three are spectroscopically-confirmed SNe Ia). The evolution of\nthe subluminous volumetric rate is constant or slightly decreasing with\nredshift, in contrast to the increasing SN Ia rate found for the normal stretch\npopulation, although a rising behaviour is not conclusively ruled out. The\nsubluminous sample is mainly found in early-type galaxies with little or no\nstar formation, so that the rate evolution is consistent with a galactic mass\ndependent behavior: $r(z)=A\\times M_g$, with $A=(1.1\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-14}$ SNe\nper year and solar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 22:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
