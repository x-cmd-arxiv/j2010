(arXive:astro-ph:/1011.4035, 2010) the authors\naddressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of\nhigh-resolution MHD simulations. They focused, in particular, on the problem of\nenergy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet\n(CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are\nformed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence\nprocesses. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly\nfragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective\nenergy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether\nthis mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation\nby deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The\nresults of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a\nspecific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded\nin the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of\nenergetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission\nregions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of\ndiffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and\ndynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping. Using the\nresults of the underlying MHD simulation we derive the expected structure of\nribbon emission and we extract selected statistical properties of the modelled\nbright kernels.

However, in biological applications, there are\noften a group of correlated genes responsible for clinical outcomes, and the\nuse of the covariance information can significantly reduce misclassification\nrates. The extent of such error rate reductions is unveiled by comparing the\nmisclassification rates of the Fisher discriminant rule and the independence\nrule. To materialize the gain based on finite samples, a Regularized Optimal\nAffine Discriminant (ROAD) is proposed based on a covariance penalty. ROAD\nselects an increasing number of features as the penalization relaxes. Further\nbenefits can be achieved when a screening method is employed to narrow the\nfeature pool before hitting the ROAD. An efficient Constrained Coordinate\nDescent algorithm (CCD) is also developed to solve the associated optimization\nproblems. Sampling properties of oracle type are established. Simulation\nstudies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate\nthe advantages of the new classification procedure under a variety of\ncorrelation structures. A delicate result on continuous piecewise linear\nsolution path for the ROAD optimization problem at the population level\njustifies the linear interpolation of the CCD algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 22:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 17:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

The attenuation in typical LBGs at z=2-3\nand LBAs is very similar. Because LBAs are much better analogs to LBGs compared\nto previous local star-forming samples, including M99, the practice of\ndust-correcting the SFRs of high redshift galaxies based on the local\ncalibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. We illustrate the\nimportance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relation\nbetween UV measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated,\ndust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 22:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In some\napplications, the shortcut paths added to the graph in order to obtain small\ndiameter can use Steiner vertices, that is, vertices not in the original graph\nG. The resulting spanner is called a Steiner transitive-closure spanner\n(Steiner TC-spanner).\n  Motivated by applications to property reconstruction and access control\nhierarchies, we concentrate on Steiner TC-spanners of directed acyclic graphs\nor, equivalently, partially ordered sets. In these applications, the goal is to\nfind a sparsest Steiner k-TC-spanner of a poset G for a given k and G. The\nfocus of this paper is the relationship between the dimension of a poset and\nthe size of its sparsest Steiner TCspanner. The dimension of a poset G is the\nsmallest d such that G can be embedded into a d-dimensional directed hypergrid\nvia an order-preserving embedding.\n  We present a nearly tight lower bound on the size of Steiner 2-TC-spanners of\nd-dimensional directed hypergrids. It implies better lower bounds on the\ncomplexity of local reconstructors of monotone functions and functions with low\nLipschitz constant. The proof of the lower bound constructs a dual solution to\na linear programming relaxation of the Steiner 2-TC-spanner problem. We also\nshow that one can efficiently construct a Steiner 2-TC-spanner, of size\nmatching the lower bound, for any low-dimensional poset. Finally, we present a\nlower bound on the size of Steiner k-TC-spanners of d-dimensional posets that\nshows that the best-known construction, due to De Santis et al., cannot be\nimproved significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 22:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

To study the\neffect of small-scale magnetic elements on total and spectral irradiance, we\nderive their contrasts from 3-D MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere. Such\ncalculations are necessary since measurements of small-scale flux tube\ncontrasts are confined to a few wavelengths and suffer from scattered light and\ninstrument defocus, even for space observations. To test the contrast\ncalculations, we compare rms contrasts from simulations with those obtained\nwith the broad-band filter imager mounted on the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT)\nonboard the Hinode satellite and also analyse centre-to-limb variations (CLV).\nThe 3-D MHD simulations include the interaction between convection and magnetic\nflux tubes. They have been run with non-grey radiative transfer using the MURaM\ncode. Simulations have an average vertical magnetic field of 0G, 50G, and 200G.\nEmergent intensities are calculated with the spectral synthesis code ATLAS9 and\nare convolved with a theoretical point-spread function to account for the\nproperties of the observations' optical system. We find reasonable agreement\nfor simulated and observed intensity distributions in the visible continuum\nbands. Agreement is poorer for the CN and G-Bands. The analysis of the\nsimulations exhibits a potentially more realistic centre-to-limb behaviour than\ncalculations based on 1-D model atmospheres. We conclude that starting from 3-D\nMHD simulations represents a powerful approach to obtaining intensity contrasts\nfor a wide wavelength coverage and for different positions on the solar disk.\nThis also paves the way for future calculations of facular and network contrast\nas a function of magnetic fluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 22:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Thanks to the very\nearly discovery, it is possible to place tight constraints on the SN explosion\nepoch. The expansion velocities measured from near maximum spectra are found to\nbe only slightly smaller than those measured from spectra of the prototype\nbroad-lined SN 1998bw associated with GRB 980425.

It is oftentimes computationally\nharder than solving the original problem. Even worse, truthfulness can be\nutterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism's outcome. One obstacle\nis that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such\nas the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call\nmechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they\nimplicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation\nusing only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness\nis a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of\nlarge payments.\n  We largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are\npossible.

During the planet formation stage, embryos undergoing type I migration are\nexpected to be stalled at inner edge of magnetic inactive disk ($a_{\\rm crit}\n\\sim 0.2-0.3 ~$AU). This mechanism makes the location around $a_{\\rm crit}$ a\nsweet spot of forming planets. Especially, $a_{\\rm crit}$ of dwarf stars with\nmasses $\\sim 0.5 M_\\odot$ is roughly inside the habitable zone of the system.\nIn this paper we study the formation of habitable planets due to this mechanism\nwith a model system OGLE-06-109L.

We model the embryos\nundergoing type I migration in the gas disk with a constant disk accretion rate\n($\\dot M$). Giant planets in outside orbits affect the formation of habitable\nplanets through secular perturbations at the early stage and secular resonance\nat the later stage. We find that the existence and the masses of the habitable\nplanets in OGLE-06-10L system depend on both $\\dot M$ and the speed of type I\nmigration. If planets formed earlier so that $\\dot M$ is larger ($\\sim 10^{-7}\nM_\\odot $ yr$^{-1}$), terrestrial planet can not be survived unless the type I\nmigration rate is an order of magnitude less. If planets formed later so that\n$\\dot M$ is smaller ($\\sim 10^{-8} M_\\odot $ yr$^{-1}$), single and high mass\nterrestrial planets with high water contents ($\\sim 5% $) will be formed by\ninward migration of outer planet cores. A slower speed migration will result in\nseveral planets by collisions of embryos, thus their water contents are low\n($\\sim 2%$).

Starting from the full Hamiltonian we show\nthat the circuit can be modeled as a charge qubit (ACPT) coupled to an\nanharmonic oscillator (dc-SQUID). Depending on the anharmonicity of the SQUID,\nthe Hamiltonian can be reduced either to one that describes two coupled qubits\nor to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. Here the dc-SQUID can be viewed as a\ntunable micron-size resonator. The coupling term, which is a combination of a\ncapacitive and a Josephson coupling between the two qubits, can be tuned from\nthe very strong- to the zero-coupling regimes. It describes very precisely the\ntunable coupling strength measured in this circuit and explains the\n'quantronium' as well as the adiabatic quantum transfer read-out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 08:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

Methods: The extinction curve of Paranal was\nobtained through low-resolution spectroscopy of 8 spectrophotometric standard\nstars observed with FORS1 mounted at the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope, covering a\nspectral range 3300-8000 A. A total of 600 spectra were collected on more than\n40 nights distributed over six months, from October 2008 to March 2009. The\naverage extinction curve was derived using a global fit algorithm, which\nallowed us to simultaneously combine all the available data. The main\natmospheric parameters were retrieved using the LBLRTM radiative transfer code,\nwhich was also utilised to study the impact of variability of the main\nmolecular bands of O2, O3, and H2O, and to estimate their column densities.\nResults: In general, the extinction curve of Paranal appears to conform to\nthose derived for other astronomical sites in the Atacama desert, like La Silla\nand Cerro Tololo. However, a systematic deficit with respect to the extinction\ncurve derived for Cerro Tololo before the El Chichon eruption is detected below\n4000 A. We attribute this downturn to a non standard aerosol composition,\nprobably revealing the presence of volcanic pollutants above the Atacama\ndesert. An analysis of all spectroscopic extinction curves obtained since 1974\nshows that the aerosol composition has been evolving during the last 35 years.\nThe persistence of traces of non meteorologic haze suggests the effect of\nvolcanic eruptions, like those of El Chichon and Pinatubo, lasts several\ndecades. The usage of the standard CTIO and La Silla extinction curves\nimplemented in IRAF and MIDAS produce systematic over/under-estimates of the\nabsolute flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 08:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

When the digraph has infinitely many ends we show that the\ndescendants of a vertex form a tree, and the reachability graph (which is one\nof the basic building blocks of the digraph) is one of: an even cycle, a\ncomplete bipartite graph, the complement of a perfect matching, or an infinite\nsemiregular tree.

Methods: Our analysis is based on 89 Type Ia supernovae at a redshift\ninterval z = 0.05 - 0.3, for which multiband SDSS photometry is available. A\nlower-z spectroscopy reference sample was used for comparisons over cosmic\ntime. We present measurements of time series of pseudo equivalent widths and\nline velocities of the main spectral features in Type Ia supernovae. Results:\nSupernovae with shallower features are found predominantly among the\nintrinsically brighter slow declining supernovae. We detect the strongest\ncorrelation between lightcurve stretch and the Si ii 4000 absorption feature,\nwhich also correlates with the estimated mass and star formation rate of the\nhost galaxy. We also report a tentative correlation between colour excess and\nspectral properties. If confirmed, this would suggest that moderate reddening\nof Type Ia supernovae is dominated by effects in the explosion or its immediate\nenvironment, as opposed to extinction by interstellar dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 13:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The two 1D hydrogen atoms, A and B,\nare assumed to be initially in their ground states with a large (but otherwise\narbitrary) internuclear separation of R = 100 a.u. (5.29 nm). Two types of a\nspatial envelope of a laser field linearly po- larized along the z-axis are\nconsidered: (i) a broad Gaussian envelope, such that atom A is excited by the\nlaser field predominantly, and (ii) a narrow envelope, such that practically\nonly atom A is excited by the laser field.

It is shown that with a narrow spatial envelope of\nthe laser field, the underlying mechanisms of the energy transfer from A to B\nand the ionization of B are the Coulomb attraction of the laser driven electron\nby the proton of atom B and a short-range Coulomb repulsion of the two\nelectrons when their wave functions significantly overlap in the domain of atom\nB.

It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where\nfor instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of\nequidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,\nUhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance\nDD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the\nenvironment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant\nsequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by\nUDD for intermediate regimes is not clear. In this paper, we analyze the\nrelative DD performance in this regime experimentally, using solid-state\nnuclear magnetic resonance. Our system-qubits are 13C nuclear spins and the\nenvironment consists of a 1H nuclear spin-bath whose spectral density is close\nto a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

The addition of an accelerometer on board a spacecraft provides\norbit determination specialists and physicists with an additional observable of\ngreat interest: it measures the value of the non-gravitational acceleration\nacting on the spacecraft, i.e. the departure of the probe from geodesic motion.\nThis technology is now routinely used for geodesy missions in Earth orbits with\nelectrostatic accelerometers. This article proposes a technological evolution\nwhich consists in adding a subsystem to remove the bias of an electrostatic\naccelerometer. It aims at enhancing the scientific return of interplanetary\nmissions in the Solar System, from the point of view of fundamental physics as\nwell as Solar System physics. The main part of the instrument is an\nelectrostatic accelerometer called MicroSTAR, which inherits mature\ntechnologies based on Onera's experience in the field of accelerometry. This\naccelerometer is mounted on a rotating stage, called Bias Rejection System,\nwhich modulates the non-gravitational acceleration and thus permits to remove\nthe bias of the instrument from the signal of interest. This article presents\nthe motivations of this study, describes the instrument, called GAP, and the\nmeasurement principle, and discusses the performance of the instrument as well\nas integration constraints. Within a mass of 3.1 kg and an average consumption\nof 3 W, it is possible to reach a precision of 1 pm s$^{-2}$ for the\nacceleration measured with an integration time of five hours. Combining this\nobservable with the radio tracking data, it is therefore possible to compare\nthe motion of the spacecraft to theoretical predictions with a precision\nimproved by at least three orders of magnitude with respect to existing\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 15:31:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 13:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 09:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

The source-free version of Maxwell's equations is purely\ndynamical, first-order in time and has a well-defined nonnegative conserved\nfield energy, but is decidedly noncanonical, an issue that has attracted little\nattention. The opposite parities of the electric and magnetic fields and\nconsequent curl operations that typify Maxwell's equations are especially at\nodds with their being canonical fields. Transformation of the magnetic field\ninto the transverse part of the vector potential helps but is not sufficient;\nfurther simple nonnegative symmetric integral transforms, which commute with\nall differential operators, are needed for both fields; such transforms also\nsupplant the curls in the equations of motion. The canonical replacements of\nthe source-free electromagnetic fields remain transverse-vector fields, but are\nmore diffuse than their predecessors. Combined as the real and imaginary parts\nof a complex field, the canonical fields prove to be the transverse-vector wave\nfunction of a time-dependent Schroedinger equation whose Hamiltonian operator\nis the quantization of the free photon's square-root relativistic energy. Thus\nproper quantization of the source-free Maxwell equations is identical to second\nquantization of free photons that have normal square-root energy. There is no\nphysical reason why first and second quantization of any relativistic free\nparticle ought not to proceed in precise parallel, utilizing the square-root\nHamiltonian operator. This natural procedure leaves no role for the completely\nartificial Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, as accords with their grossly\nunphysical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 10:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}
