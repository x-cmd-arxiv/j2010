The model studies generation of EM waves by a super-thermal, hot beam\nof electrons injected into a plasma thread that contains uniform longitudinal\nmagnetic field and a parabolic density gradient. In effect, a single magnetic\nline connecting Sun to earth is considered, for which several cases are\nstudied. (i) We find that the physical system without a beam is stable and only\nlow amplitude level EM drift waves (noise) are excited. (ii) The beam injection\ndirection is controlled by setting either longitudinal or oblique electron\ninitial drift speed, i.e. by setting the beam pitch angle. In the case of zero\npitch angle, the beam excites only electrostatic, standing waves, oscillating\nat plasma frequency, in the beam injection spatial location, and only low level\nEM drift wave noise is also generated. (iii) In the case of oblique beam pitch\nangles, again electrostatic waves with same properties are excited. However,\nnow the beam also generates EM waves with the properties commensurate to type\nIII radio bursts. The latter is evidenced by the wavelet analysis of transverse\nelectric field component, which shows that as the beam moves to the regions of\nlower density, frequency of the EM waves drops accordingly. (iv) When the\ndensity gradient is removed, electron beam with an oblique pitch angle still\ngenerates the EM radiation. However, in the latter case no frequency decrease\nis seen.

Under such conditions, ions\nare dragged by neutrals, and the magnetic field acts as if it is frozen-in to\nthe dynamics of the neutral gas.

The dissipation of these currents leads to resistive electron heating\nand efficient gas ionization.

The fifteen quasars in our sample cover\nthe range 4.6 < z_q < 6.4, enabling the first proximity effect measurements of\nthe UVB at z > 5. The metagalactic hydrogen ionisation rate, Gamma_bkg, was\ndetermined by modelling the combined ionisation field from the quasar and the\nUVB in the proximity zone on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The optical depths in the\nspectra were corrected for the expected effect of the quasar until the mean\nflux in the proximity region equalled that in the average Ly-alpha forest, and\nfrom this we make a measurement of Gamma_bkg. A number of systematic effects\nwere tested using synthetic spectra. Noise in the flux was found to be the\nlargest source of bias at z ~ 5, while uncertainties in the mean transmitted\nLy-alpha flux are responsible for the largest bias at z ~ 6. The impacts of\nlarge-scale overdensities and Lyman limit systems on Gamma_bkg were also\ninvestigated, but found to be small at z > 5. We find a decline in Gamma_bkg\nwith redshift, from log(Gamma_bkg) = -12.15 $\\pm$ 0.16 at z ~ 5 to\nlog(Gamma_bkg) = -12.84 $\\pm$ 0.18 at z ~ 6 (1 sigma errors). Compared to UVB\nmeasurements at lower redshifts, our measurements suggest a drop of a factor of\nfive in the HI photoionisation rate between z ~ 4 and z ~ 6. The decline of\nGamma_bkg appears to be gradual, and we find no evidence for a sudden change in\nthe UVB at any redshift that would indicate a rapid change in the attenuation\nlength of ionising photons. Combined with recent measurements of the evolution\nof the mean free path of ionising photons, our results imply decline in the\nemissivity of ionising photons by roughly a factor of two from z ~ 5 to 6,\nalbeit with significant uncertainty due to the measurement errors in both\nGamma_bkg and the mean free path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 17:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The SDSS-II Supernova Survey, conducted between 2005 and 2007, was\ndesigned to detect a large number of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) around z~0.2,\nthe redshift \"gap\" between low-z and high-z SN searches. The survey has\nprovided multi-band photometric lightcurves for variable targets, and SN\ncandidates were scheduled for spectroscopic observations, primarily to provide\nSN classification and accurate redshifts. We present SN spectra obtained in\n2006 and 2007 using the NTT and the NOT. Aims. We provide an atlas of SN\nspectra in the range z =0.03-0.32 that complements the well-sampled lightcurves\nfrom SDSS-II in the forthcoming three-year SDSS SN cosmology analysis. The\nsample can, for example, be used for spectral studies of SNe Ia, which are\ncritical for understanding potential systematic effects when SNe are used to\ndetermine cosmological distances. Methods. The spectra were reduced in a\nuniform manner, and special care was taken in estimating the uncertainties for\nthe different processing steps. Host-galaxy light was subtracted when possible\nand the SN type fitted using the SuperNova IDentification code (SNID). We also\npresent comparisons between spectral and photometric dating using SALT\nlightcurve fits to the photometry from SDSS-II, as well as the global\ndistribution of our sample in terms of the lightcurve parameters: stretch and\ncolour. Results. We report new spectroscopic data from 141 SNe Ia, mainly\nbetween -9 and +15 days from lightcurve maximum, including a few cases of\nmulti-epoch observations. This homogeneous, host-galaxy subtracted, SN Ia\nspectroscopic sample is among the largest such data sets and unique in its\nredshift interval. The sample includes two potential SN 1991T-like SNe (SN\n2006on and SN 2007ni) and one potential SN 2002cx-like SN (SN 2007ie).

However, the mass accretion rates derived from the X-ray\nobservations are consistently lower than those derived from UV/optical/NIR\nstudies. We aim to test the hypothesis that the high density soft X-ray\nemission is from accretion by analysing optical accretion tracers from an X-ray\nselected sample of CTTSs in a homogeneous manner. We analyse optical spectra of\na sample of CTTSs and calculate the accretion rates based on measuring optical\nemission lines. These are then compared to the accretion rates derived from the\nX-ray spectroscopy. We find that, for each CTTS in our sample, the different\noptical tracers predict mass accretion rates that agree within the errors,\nalbeit with a spread of ~1 order of magnitude. Typically, mass accretion rates\nderived from Halpha and HeI 5876 Ang are larger than those derived from Hbeta,\nHgamma and OI. When comparisons of the optical mass accretion rates are made to\nthe X-ray derived mass accretion rates, we find that: a) the latter are always\nlower (but by varying amounts); b) the latter range within a factor of ~2\naround 2x10^{-10} M_odot yr^{-1}, despite the fact that the former span a range\nof ~3 orders of magnitude. We suggest that the systematic underestimation of\nthe X-ray derived mass accretion rates could depend on the density distribution\ninside the accretion streams, where the densest part of the stream is not\nvisible in the X-ray band because of the absorption by the stellar atmosphere.\nWe also suggest that a non-negligible optical depth of X-ray emission lines\nproduced by post-shock accreting plasma may explain the almost constant mass\naccretion rates derived in X-rays if the effect is larger in stars with larger\noptical mass accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 21:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However,\nin the context of the CMSSM, the required supersymmetric contributions (which\ngrow with decreasing supersymmetric masses) are in potential tension with a\npossibly large Higgs mass (which requires large stop masses). In the limit of\nvery large m_h supersymmetry gets decoupled, and the CMSSM must show the same\ndiscrepancy as the SM with a_mu . But it is much less clear for which size of\nm_h does the tension start to be unbearable. In this paper, we quantify this\ntension with the help of Bayesian techniques.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the recovering ability of l_p-minimization (0<=p<=1) as p varies,\nwhere l_p-minimization returns a vector with the least l_p ``norm'' among all\nthe vectors x satisfying Ax=y. Besides analyzing the performance of strong\nrecovery where l_p-minimization needs to recover all the sparse vectors up to\ncertain sparsity, we also for the first time analyze the performance of\n``weak'' recovery of l_p-minimization (0<=p<1) where the aim is to recover all\nthe sparse vectors on one support with fixed sign pattern. When m/n goes to 1,\nwe provide sharp thresholds of the sparsity ratio that differentiates the\nsuccess and failure via l_p-minimization. For strong recovery, the threshold\nstrictly decreases from 0.5 to 0.239 as p increases from 0 to 1. Surprisingly,\nfor weak recovery, the threshold is 2/3 for all p in [0,1), while the threshold\nis 1 for l_1-minimization. We also explicitly demonstrate that l_p-minimization\n(p<1) can return a denser solution than l_1-minimization. For any m/n<1, we\nprovide bounds of sparsity ratio for strong recovery and weak recovery\nrespectively below which l_p-minimization succeeds with overwhelming\nprobability. Our bound of strong recovery improves on the existing bounds when\nm/n is large. Regarding the recovery threshold, l_p-minimization has a higher\nthreshold with smaller p for strong recovery; the threshold is the same for all\np for sectional recovery; and l_1-minimization can outperform l_p-minimization\nfor weak recovery. These are in contrast to traditional wisdom that\nl_p-minimization has better sparse recovery ability than l_1-minimization since\nit is closer to l_0-minimization. We provide an intuitive explanation to our\nfindings and use numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 23:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

We adopt a scenario in which (i) MSCs with masses of M_s can be\nformed from high-mass, high-density giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in their host\ngalactic building blocks embedded in dark matter halos at high redshifts and\n(ii) their evolution therefore can be significantly influenced by M_s, their\ninitial locations, and physical properties of their hosts. Our 3D\nhydrodynamical simulations show that gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be\nretained within MSCs and consequently converted into new stars very efficiently\nin the central regions of MSCs, only if M_s exceed a threshold mass (M_th) of\n~10^6 M_sun. The new stars can correspond to the ``second generation (SG)'' of\nstars with higher Na and lower O abundances observed in GCs. Star formation\nefficiencies during the formation of SG stars within MSCs with M_s > M_th can\nbe rather high (0.3-0.9) so that very compact new clusters within original MSCs\ncan be formed. M_s should be as large as 10^6-10^7 M_sun to explain the\nobserved large fraction of SG stars in the present ordinary Galactic GCs,\nbecause new stars can consist of only 1-4% among all stars for the standard\nIMF. Nuclear MSCs are found to retain much more effectively the AGB ejecta and\nconvert more efficiently the gas into new stars owing to much deeper\ngravitational potential of their hosts. We suggest that both M_s and their\nlocations within their hosts can determine whether abundance spread can be seen\nonly in light elements or even in heavy ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2010 09:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The general idea is to depart\nfrom a system generating successive pulses of oscillations, each of which gives\nrise to the next one with transformation of the phase in accordance with\nchaotic Bernoulli map. From mathematical point of view, it is an\ninfinite-dimensional system due to presence of the time delay. Nevertheless,\nthe material we present gives a foundation to assert that the model delivers an\nexample of a small-dimensional hyperbolic strange attractor, embedded in the\ninfinite-dimensional phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2010 13:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

High-quality spectra are homogeneously analysed using\nsophisticated non-LTE line-formation and comprehensive analysis strategies. All\nthe stars follow a previously established tight trend in the N/C-N/O ratio and\nshow normal helium abundances, tracing the nuclear path of the CNO-cycles\nquantitatively. A correlation of the strength of the mixing signature with the\npresence of magnetic fields is found. In conjunction with low rotation\nvelocities this implies that magnetic breaking is highly efficient for the\nspin-down of some massive stars. We suggest several objects for follow-up\nspectropolarimetry, as the mixing signature indicates a possible magnetic\nnature of these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2010 15:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Therefore, one has to infer the field strength in the higher\nlayers of the solar atmosphere from the measured photospheric field based on\nthe assumption that the corona is force-free. Meanwhile, those measured data\nare inconsistent with the above force-free assumption. Therefore, one has to\napply some transformations to these data before nonlinear force-free\nextrapolation codes can be applied. Extrapolation codes in cartesian geometry\nfor modelling the magnetic field in the corona do not take the curvature of the\nSun's surface into account and can only be applied to relatively small areas,\ne.g., a single active region. Here we apply a method for nonlinear force-free\ncoronal magnetic field modelling and preprocessing of photospheric vector\nmagnetograms in spherical geometry using the optimization procedure.We solve\nthe nonlinear force-free field equations by minimizing a functional in\nspherical coordinates over a restricted area of the Sun. We extend the\nfunctional by an additional term, which allows to incorporate measurement error\nand treat regions with lacking observational data. We use vector magnetograph\ndata from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun survey\n(SOLIS) to model the coronal magnetic field. We study two neighbouring\nmagnetically connected active regions observed on May 15 2009. For vector\nmagnetograms with variable measurement precision and randomly scattered data\ngaps (e.g., SOLIS/VSM) the new code yields field models which satisfy the\nsolenoidal and force-free condition significantly better as it allows\ndeviations between the extrapolated boundary field and observed boundary data\nwithin measurement errors. Data gaps are assigned to an infinite error. We\nextend this new scheme to spherical geometry and apply it for the first time to\nreal data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 19:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
