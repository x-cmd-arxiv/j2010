Considerable interest has also been devoted in\ninvestigating the properties of turbulence in thermally unstable flows, special\nemphasis on molecular clouds and the possibility of star formation. In this\nstudy, we investigate another setting in which this instability may be\nimportant, namely its effect on dynamo action in interstellar flows. The setup\nwe consider is a three dimensional periodic cube of gas with an initially weak\nmagnetic field, subject to heating and cooling, the properties of which are\nsuch that thermal instability is provoked at certain temperature regime. Dynamo\naction is established through external forcing on the flow field. By comparing\nthe results with a cooling function with exactly the same net effect but no\nthermally unstable regime, we find the following. The critical Reynolds number\nfor the onset of the large-scale dynamo was observed to roughly double between\nthe thermally stable versus unstable runs, the conclusion being that the\nthermal instability makes large-scale dynamo action more difficult. Whereas\ndensity and magnetic fields were observed to be almost completely uncorrelated\nin the thermally stable cases investigated, the action of thermal instability\nwas observed to produce a positive correlation of the form B propto rho^0.2.\nThis correlation is rather weak, and in addition it was observed to break down\nat the limit of the highest densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2010 16:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 18:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This\nmeasurement requires a deep understanding of the backgrounds to top quark\nproduction, thus setting the ground for the measurements of top quark intrinsic\nproperties. Finally, measuring sigma(ttbar) allows to set limits on new physics\nmodels that predict new particles coupling to the most recently discovered\nquark.

We analyse the process\nof absorption imaging and show that it is possible to observe atom number\nvariance directly, with a signal-to-noise ratio ten times better than the\natomic projection noise limit on 10^6 condensate atoms. We discuss the\ntechnical and fundamental noise sources that limit our current system, and\noutline the improvements that can be made. Our results indicate that, with\nfurther experimental refinements, it will be possible to produce and measure\nthe output of a sub-shot-noise limited, large atom number BEC-based\ninterferometer.\n  In an addendum to the original paper, we attribute our inability to observe\nquantum projection noise to the stability of our microwave oscillator and\nbackground magnetic field. Numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations for our system show that dephasing due to spatial dynamics driven by\ninterparticle interactions account for much of the observed decay in fringe\nvisibility at long interrogation times. The simulations show good agreement\nwith the experimental data when additional technical decoherence is accounted\nfor, and suggest that the clock states are indeed immiscible.

From an analysis treating rotation frequency as a small\nparameter it is found that slow rotation tends to $destabilize$ high\nradial-order $retrograde$ $g$-modes, although the effect is very small or\nabsent for relatively low order modes. Calculating eigenfrequencies at selected\nrotation rates, we find, on the other hand, that rapid rotation tends to\n$stabilize$ $retrograde$ $g$-modes. The stabilizing effect appears stronger for\nless massive B-type stars having low effective temperatures. If we change\nrotation rate continuously, the frequency of a $g$-mode belonging to ($l', m$)\ncrosses frequencies of other $g$-modes belonging to ($l', m$). If the parity of\nthe two encountering modes are the same, they interact each other and the\nstability (i.e., imaginary part of eigenfrequency) of each mode is modified.\nUsing an asymptotic method we discuss the property of such mode crossings and\ncouplings. For rapidly rotating stars mode couplings are important for the\nstability of low degree $g$-modes.

The atmospheric parameters of all objects\nare compatible with core helium-burning stars. The companions are most likely\nwhite dwarfs. In one case the companion could be shown to be a white dwarf by\nthe absence of light-curve variations. However, in most cases late type main\nsequence stars cannot be firmly excluded. Comparing our small sample with the\nknown population of close sdB binaries we show that our target selection method\naiming at massive companions is efficient. The minimum companion masses of all\nbinaries in our sample are high compared to the reference sample of known sdB\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 13:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Bodies can be trapped in resonance when their\norbital semi-major axes change, for instance when they migrate through a\nprotoplanetary disc. We use a Hamiltonian model to thoroughly investigate the\ncapture behaviour for first and second order resonances. Using this method, all\nresonances of the same order can be described by one equation, with\napplications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling. We focus on the\nlimit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive\nplanet. We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends\non the relative migration rate of the planet and particle, and the particle's\neccentricity. Resonant capture fails for high migration rates, and has\ndecreasing probability for higher eccentricities, although for certain\nmigration rates, capture probability peaks at a finite eccentricity. We also\ncalculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for\ncaptured particles, and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur.\nLibration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity. The model\nallows for a complete description of a particle's behaviour as it successively\nencounters several resonances.

Such a fact may be used to set constraints on\ntheories of high-mass star formation, but requires confirmation that the mass\nand luminosity of IRAS 20126+4104 are indeed typical of a B0.5 star, which in\nturn requires an accurate estimate of the distance. We used the Very Long\nBaseline Array and the European VLBI Network to observe the 22.2 GHz water and\n6.7 GHz methanol masers in IRAS 20126+4104 at a number of epochs suitably\ndistributed in time. The absolute positions of the maser features were\nestablished with respect to reference quasars, which allowed us to derive\nabsolute proper motions. From the parallax of the water masers we obtain a\ndistance of 1.64 \\pm 0.05 kpc, which is very similar to the value adopted so\nfar in the literature (1.7 kpc) and confirms that IRAS 20126+4104 is a\nhigh-mass (proto)star. From the methanol masers we derive the component in the\nplane of the sky of the systemic velocity of the disk+star system (-16 km/s in\nright-ascension and +7.6 km/s in declination). Accurate knowledge of the\ndistance and systemic velocity allows us to improve on the model fit to the\nwater maser jet presented in a previous study. Finally, we identify two groups\nof methanol maser features, one undergoing rotation in the disk and possibly\ndistributed along a narrow ring centered on the star, the other characterised\nby relative proper motions indicating that the features are moving away from\nthe disk, perpendicular to it. We speculate that the latter group might be\ntracing the disk material marginally entrained by the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 14:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We use a three-dimensional\nnon-ideal hydrodynamic ISM model in a domain extending 0.5 x 0.5 kpc\nhorizontally and 2 kpc vertically to explore the relative importance of various\nphysical and numerical effects on the multi-phase, turbulent ISM. We include\nboth Type I and II SNe, the latter occurring only in dense regions. First we\ninvestigate the role of the thermal instability in the temperature range\n300-6100 K, comparing results obtained for two different cooling functions, one\nsusceptible to the instability, the other stable. The presence of thermal\ninstability in the system is mainly visible as the tendency of the gas to avoid\nthe relevant temperature range, as it quickly evolves towards either colder or\nwarmer phases. Nevertheless, the formation of dense structures for both cooling\nfunctions appears to be dominated by expanding and colliding supernova\nremnants, rather than by the thermal instability. As we need to include a\nfinite thermal conduction coefficient to resolve the thermal instability with\nour uniform grid, we also explore the effects of changing Prandtl number on the\nsystem. The purely divergent SN forcing is found to produce significant amounts\nof vorticity. The relative vorticity is around 0.6-0.7 for the highest Prandtl\nnumbers explored, Pr=40, and is observed to diminish almost by a factor of two\nfor the lowest Prandtl numbers studied, Pr=1. Rotation laws with angular\nvelocity decreasing or increasing outwards are investigated, enabling us to\nseparate the contributions to kinetic helicity due to rotation and shear. When\nangular velocity decreases outwards, these two contributions partly cancel each\nother, resulting in a smaller net helicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 15:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 07:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 11:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}

Although an analysis based on the random\nphase approximation has been performed for multi-scale quantum criticality, an\nextension to an Eliashberg framework was claimed to be far from triviality in\nrespect that the self-energy correction beyond the random phase approximation,\nwhich originates from scattering with $z = 3$ longitudinal fluctuations,\nchanges the dynamical exponent $z = 2$ in the transverse mode, explicitly\ndemonstrated in nematic quantum criticality. A novel ingredient of the present\nstudy is to introduce an anomalous self-energy associated with the spin-flip\nchannel. Such an anomalous self-energy turns out to be essential for\nself-consistency of the Eliashberg framework in the multi-scale quantum\ncritical point because this off diagonal self-energy cancels the normal\nself-energy exactly in the low energy limit, preserving the dynamics of both $z\n= 3$ longitudinal and $z = 2$ transverse modes. This multi-scale quantum\ncriticality is consistent with that in a perturbative analysis for the nematic\nquantum critical point, where a vertex correction in the fermion bubble diagram\ncancels a singular contribution due to the self-energy correction, maintaining\nthe $z = 2$ transverse mode. We also claim that this off diagonal self-energy\ngives rise to an artificial electric field in the energy-momentum space in\naddition to the Berry curvature.
