As a\nfitness function (the energy function) to be maximized by the GA, we choose the\nso-called the $\\gamma$-value of anisotropy which can be observed empirically in\ntypical flocks of starling. We confirm that the GA successfully finds the\nsolution having a large $\\gamma$-value leading-up to a strong anisotropy. The\nnumerical experience shows that the procedure might enable us to make more\nrealistic and efficient artificial flocking of starling even in our personal\ncomputers. We also evaluate two distinct types of interactions in agents,\nnamely, metric and topological definitions of interactions. We confirmed that\nthe topological definition can explain the empirical evidence much better than\nthe metric definition does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 16:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2011 17:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Particle engulfment involves\nparticle recognition by cell-surface receptors, signaling and remodeling of the\nactin cytoskeleton to guide the membrane around the particle in a zipper-like\nfashion. Despite the signaling complexity, phagocytosis also depends strongly\non biophysical parameters, such as particle shape, and the need for\nactin-driven force generation remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a\nnovel, three-dimensional and stochastic biophysical model of phagocytosis, and\nstudy the engulfment of particles of various sizes and shapes, including spiral\nand rod-shaped particles reminiscent of bacteria. Highly curved shapes are not\ntaken up, in line with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we\nsurprisingly find that even without actin-driven force generation, engulfment\nproceeds in a large regime of parameter values, albeit more slowly and with\nhighly variable phagocytic cups. We experimentally confirm these predictions\nusing fibroblasts, transfected with immunoreceptor FcyRIIa for engulfment of\nimmunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Specifically, we compare the wild-type\nreceptor with a mutant receptor, unable to signal to the actin cytoskeleton.\nBased on the reconstruction of phagocytic cups from imaging data, we indeed\nshow that cells are able to engulf small particles even without support from\nbiological actin-driven processes. This suggests that biochemical pathways\nrender the evolutionary ancient process of phagocytic highly robust, allowing\ncells to engulf even very large particles. The particle-shape dependence of\nphagocytosis makes a systematic investigation of host-pathogen interactions and\nan efficient design of a vehicle for drug delivery possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 16:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

We apply the caustic technique to clusters with\nmass M_200>=10^{14}h^{-1} M_sun extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulation of a LambdaCDM universe. With a few tens of redshifts per squared\ncomoving megaparsec within the cluster, the caustic technique, on average,\nrecovers the profile of the escape velocity from the cluster with better than\n10 percent accuracy up to r~4 r_200. The caustic technique also recovers the\nmass profile with better than 10 percent accuracy in the range (0.6-4) r_200,\nbut it overestimates the mass up to 70 percent at smaller radii. This\noverestimate is a consequence of neglecting the radial dependence of the\nfilling function F_beta(r). The 1-sigma uncertainty on individual escape\nvelocity profiles increases from ~20 to ~50 percent when the radius increases\nfrom r~0.1 r_200 to ~4 r_200. Individual mass profiles have 1-sigma uncertainty\nbetween 40 and 80 percent within the radial range (0.6-4) r_200. We show that\nthe amplitude of these uncertainties is completely due to the assumption of\nspherical symmetry, which is difficult to drop. Alternatively, we can apply the\ntechnique to synthetic clusters obtained by stacking individual clusters: in\nthis case, the 1-sigma uncertainty on the escape velocity profile is smaller\nthan 20 percent out to 4 r_200. The caustic technique thus provides reliable\naverage profiles which extend to regions difficult or impossible to probe with\nother techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 16:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In order to\ntrack the origin of the huge effective mass, the case of intermediate valence\ncompounds is discussed with emphasis of the differences between Yb and Ce\nmaterials. The formation of the effective mass is analyzed by two regular- and\nsingular-part contributions.

We present phase variations for a variety of\ndifferent radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant\nre-radiation, the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's\neccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or\ntrails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or\napproaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with\nnon-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super- rotating\nwinds, and late for sub-rotating winds. We find that for a circular orbit, the\ntiming of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction\nindicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracy\nbetween wind speed and radiative time. For circular planets the phase minimum\noccurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum -despite the fact that the\ncoolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator- and therefore does not\nconvey any additional information. In general, increasing the advective\nfrequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough\namplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to these\ntrends. Lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer\nthan their radiative time exhibit \"ringing\" whereby the hot spot generated at\nperiastron rotates in and out of view. The existence of ringing makes it\npossible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) and\nthe radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nredshifts of the Lyman alpha emission from these galaxies are offset redward of\nthe systemic redshifts by Delta_v = 162 +/- 37 (photometric) +/- 42\n(systematic) km/s for HPS194, and Delta_v = 36 +/- 35 +/- 18 km/s for HPS256.\nAn interpretation for HPS194 is that a large-scale outflow may be occurring in\nits interstellar medium.

This sensing\ntask is formulated here as that of finding the maximum number of feasible\nsubsystems of linear equations, and proved to be NP-hard. Useful links are\nestablished with compressive sampling, which aims at recovering vectors that\nare sparse. In contrast, the signals here are not sparse, but give rise to\nsparse residuals. Capitalizing on this form of sparsity, four sensing schemes\nwith complementary strengths are developed. The first scheme is a convex\nrelaxation of the original problem expressed as a second-order cone program\n(SOCP). It is shown that when the involved sensing matrices are Gaussian and\nthe reliable measurements are sufficiently many, the SOCP can recover the\noptimal solution with overwhelming probability. The second scheme is obtained\nby replacing the initial objective function with a concave one. The third and\nfourth schemes are tailored for noisy sensor data. The noisy case is cast as a\ncombinatorial problem that is subsequently surrogated by a (weighted) SOCP.\nInterestingly, the derived cost functions fall into the framework of robust\nmultivariate linear regression, while an efficient block-coordinate descent\nalgorithm is developed for their minimization. The robust sensing capabilities\nof all schemes are verified by simulated tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2011 20:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The most\nastrophysically relevant black hole is the uncharged, rotating Kerr solution, a\nmember of the more general Kerr-Newman metrics. A generalization of the\nrotating Kerr black hole to a solution of the Einstein's equation with a\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ was discovered by Carter \\cite{DWDW}.

The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as\na hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a\ncircular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical\npoint-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the\nEarth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum\nstates, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during\nfree fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.\n  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating\naround it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the\nelectronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair\nwavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of\nthe superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess\na globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in\nthe response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the\nlocalizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to\na charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that\nopposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the\nsuperconducting system.\n  A \"Cavendish-like\" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation\neffect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting\ncircuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a\npair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational\nperturbations are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 00:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-03"}

With the realization that dead zones are robust features of\nprotoplanetary disks, the search for hydrodynamical sources of turbulence\ncontinues. A possible source is the baroclinic instability (BI), which has been\nshown to exist in unmagnetized non-barotropic disks. We present shearing box\nsimulations of baroclinicly unstable, magnetized, 3D disks, in order to assess\nthe interplay between the BI and other instabilities, namely the\nmagneto-rotational instability (MRI) and the magneto-elliptical instability. We\nfind that the vortices generated and sustained by the baroclinic instability in\nthe purely hydrodynamical regime do not survive when magnetic fields are\nincluded. The MRI by far supersedes the BI in growth rate and strength at\nsaturation. The resulting turbulence is virtually identical to an MRI-only\nscenario. We measured the intrinsic vorticity profile of the vortex, finding\nlittle radial variation in the vortex core. Nevertheless, the core is disrupted\nby an MHD instability, which we identify with the magneto-elliptic instability.\nThis instability has nearly the same range of unstable wavelengths as the MRI,\nbut has higher growth rates. In fact, we identify the MRI as a limiting case of\nthe magneto-elliptic instability, when the vortex aspect ratio tends to\ninfinity (pure shear flow). We conclude that vortex excitation and\nself-sustenance by the baroclinic instability in protoplanetary disks is viable\nonly in low ionization, i.e., the dead zone. Our results are thus in accordance\nwith the layered accretion paradigm. A baroclinicly unstable dead zone should\nbe characterized by the presence of large-scale vortices whose cores are\nelliptically unstable, yet sustained by the baroclinic feedback. As magnetic\nfields destroy the vortices and the MRI outweighs the BI, the active layers are\nunmodified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 01:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 22:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 23:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this paper we give the first\ningredient, and so obtain a combinatorial spectral sequence from Khovanov\nhomology to Heegaard Floer homology; in the sequel we show that this spectral\nsequence agrees with the previously known one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 01:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 05:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

In this paper,\nthe non-unitary and non-cyclic geometric phases for two nonlinear coherent and\none squeezed states are formulated respectively. Moreover, some of their common\nproperties are discussed respectively, such as gauge invariance, non-locality\nand non-linear effects. The non-linear functions have dramatic impacts on the\nevolution of the corresponding geometric phases. They speed the evolution up or\ndown. So this property may have application in controlling or measuring\ngeometric phase. For the squeezed case, when the squeezed parameter r ->\n\\infinity, the limiting value of the geometric phase is also determined by\nnon-linear function at a given time and angular velocity. In addition, the\ngeometric phases for standard coherent and squeezed states are obtained under a\nparticular condition.

By\ndropping the emptiness condition, we define another related quantity $F(k,\n\\ell)$, which is the smallest integer such that any set of at least $F(k,\n\\ell)$ points in the plane, no three on a line, contains a convex polygon with\n$k$ vertices or a pseudo-triangle with $\\ell$ vertices. Extending a result of\nBisztriczky and T\\'oth [Discrete Geometry, Marcel Dekker, 49--58, 2003], we\nobtain the exact values of $F(k, 5)$ and $F(k, 6)$, and obtain non-trivial\nbounds on $F(k, 7)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 05:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2012 22:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 09:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-18"}

It was\npredicted in 1974 but has never been observed so far. Parity violation should\nlead to a very tiny frequency difference in the rovibrational spectra of the\nenantiomers of a chiral molecule. We have proposed to observe this predicted\nfrequency difference using the two photon Ramsey fringes technique on a\nsupersonic beam. Promising candidates for this experiment are chiral oxorhenium\ncomplexes, which present a large effect, can be synthesized in large quantity\nand enantiopure form, and can be seeded in a molecular beam. As a first step\ntowards our objective, a detailed spectroscopic study of methyltrioxorhenium\n(MTO) has been undertaken. It is an ideal test molecule as the achiral parent\nmolecule of chiral candidates for the parity violation experiment. For the\n187Re MTO isotopologue, a combined analysis of Fourier transform microwave and\ninfrared spectra as well as ultra-high resolution CO2 laser absorption spectra\nenabled the assignment of 28 rotational lines and 71 rovibrational lines, some\nof them with a resolved hyperfine structure. A set of spectroscopic parameters\nin the ground and first excited state, including hyperfine structure constants,\nwas obtained for the antisymmetric Re=O stretching mode of this molecule. This\nresult validates the experimental approach to be followed once a chiral\nderivative of MTO will be synthesized, and shows the benefit of the combination\nof several spectroscopic techniques in different spectral regions, with\ndifferent set-ups and resolutions. First high resolution spectra of jet-cooled\nMTO, obtained on the set-up being developed for the observation of molecular\nparity violation, are shown, which constitutes a major step towards the\ntargeted objective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 06:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

In\nthis paper we present a scenario for shear-banding in a particular class of\ncomplex fluids, namely foams and concentrated emulsions, which differs from\nother scenarii in two important ways. First, the appearance of shear bands is\nshown to be possible both without any intrinsic physical evolution of the\nmaterial (e.g. via a parameter coupled to the flow such as concentration or\nentanglements) and without any finite critical shear rate below which the flow\ndoes not remain stationary and homogeneous. Secondly, the appearance of shear\nbands depends on the initial conditions, i.e., the preparation of the material.\nIn other words, it is history dependent. This behaviour relies on the tensorial\ncharacter of the underlying model (2D or 3D) and is triggered by an initially\ninhomogeneous strain distribution in the material. The shear rate displays a\ndiscontinuity at the band boundary, whose amplitude is history dependent and\nthus depends on the sample preparation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 06:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 21:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 19:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

In this style, instead of waiting\nfor time-consuming operations to complete, the programmer makes a non-blocking\ncall to the operation and posts a callback task to a task buffer that is\nexecuted later when the time-consuming operation completes. A co-operative\nscheduler mediates the interaction by picking and executing callback tasks from\nthe task buffer to completion (and these callbacks can post further callbacks\nto be executed later). Writing correct asynchronous programs is hard because\nthe use of callbacks, while efficient, obscures program control flow.\n  We provide a formal model underlying asynchronous programs and study\nverification problems for this model. We show that the safety verification\nproblem for finite-data asynchronous programs is expspace-complete. We show\nthat liveness verification for finite-data asynchronous programs is decidable\nand polynomial-time equivalent to Petri Net reachability. Decidability is not\nobvious, since even if the data is finite-state, asynchronous programs\nconstitute infinite-state transition systems: both the program stack and the\ntask buffer of pending asynchronous calls can be potentially unbounded.\n  Our main technical construction is a polynomial-time semantics-preserving\nreduction from asynchronous programs to Petri Nets and conversely. The\nreduction allows the use of algorithmic techniques on Petri Nets to the\nverification of asynchronous programs.\n  We also study several extensions to the basic models of asynchronous programs\nthat are inspired by additional capabilities provided by implementations of\nasynchronous libraries, and classify the decidability and undecidability of\nverification questions on these extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 09:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 16:20:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2011 20:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Only rare and powerful steady sources, located at\ndistances larger than several hundreds of Mpc and contributing to a fraction >\n10% of the flux at 10^19 eV might be detectable. We also discuss the gamma-ray\nhalos that are produced by inverse Compton/pair production cascades seeded by\nultra-high energy cosmic rays. This latter signal strongly depends on the\nconfiguration of the extragalactic magnetic fields; it is dominated by the\nsynchrotron signal on a degree scale if the filling factor of magnetic fields\nwith B > 10^(-14) G is smaller than a few percents. Finally, we discuss briefly\nthe case of nearby potential sources such as Centaurus A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 11:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This formalism is based on the explicitly covariant\nformulation of light-front dynamics, with a decomposition of the state vector\nin Fock components. In order to be able to make definite predictions order by\norder in the truncation of the Fock expansion, we use an appropriate Fock\nsector dependent renormalization scheme. Our covariant formulation enables us\nto have a strict control of any violation of rotational invariance due to the\nchoice of a given orientation of the light-front plane. This is mandatory in\norder to define the necessary renormalization conditions, and hence to be able\nto calculate physical observables. We emphasize the role played by antiparticle\ndegrees of freedom in order to control, order by order in the Fock expansion,\nthe scale invariance of physical observables. This nonperturbative framework\ndemands also to use an appropriate regularization scheme. We show why the\nrecently proposed Taylor-Lagrange regularization scheme is a very adequate\nscheme since it can be implemented very naturally, and from a systematic point\nof view, in light-front dynamics. As a direct application of this general\nframework, we settle the basis for a new formulation of chiral effective field\ntheory in the baryonic sector based on light-front dynamics and a Fock\ndecomposition of the state vector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 12:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-03"}

Here in this work, we are dealing with the problem that,\nwhen a world coordinate point is fixed in space, image coordinates of that 3D\npoint vary for different camera positions and orientations. In computer vision\naspect, this situation is undesirable. That is, the system has to be designed\nin such a way that image coordinate of the world coordinate point will be fixed\nirrespective of the position & orientation of the cameras. We have done it in\nan elegant fashion. Firstly, camera parameters are calculated in its local\ncoordinate system. Then, we use global coordinate data to transfer all local\ncoordinate data of stereo cameras into same global coordinate system, so that\nwe can register everything into this global coordinate system. After all the\ntransformations, when the image coordinate of the world coordinate point is\ncalculated, it gives same coordinate value for all camera positions &\norientations. That is, the whole system is calibrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 12:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-03"}

We combine\nX-ray measurements from both Chandra and XMM with ground-based near-infrared\nobservations from CTIO, AAT and CFHT to compare the mass in hot gas and stars\nto the dynamical mass and state of the clusters. Only 13 of the clusters are\ndetected in X-ray emission, and for these systems we find that a range of 7-20\nper cent of their baryonic mass, and <3 per cent of their dynamical mass, is\ndetected in starlight, similar to what is observed in more massive clusters. In\ncontrast, the five undetected clusters are underluminous in X-ray emission, by\nup to a factor 10, given their stellar mass. Although the velocity distribution\nof cluster members in these systems is indistinguishable from a Gaussian, all\nshow subtle signs of being unrelaxed: either they lack a central, dominant\ngalaxy, or the bright galaxy distribution is less concentrated and/or more\nelongated than the rest of the sample.

Aim: Here we use the afterglow detection statistics of\nthe systematic follow-up observations performed with GROND since mid-2007 in\norder to derive the fraction of \"dark bursts\" according to different methods,\nand to distinguish between various scenarios for \"dark bursts\". Method:\nObservations were performed with the 7-channel \"Gamma-Ray Optical and\nNear-infrared Detector\" (GROND) at the 2.2m MPI/ESO telescope. We used the\nafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between GRB and the\nfirst GROND exposure.

Most interesting value is the phase\nrigidity of the eigenfunctions which varies between 1 (for distant\nnon-overlapping states) and 0 (at the exceptional point where the resonance\nstates completely overlap). This variation allows the system to incorporate\nenvironmentally induced effects. In the very neighborhood of an exceptional\npoint, the system can be described well by a conventional nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. In the regime of overlapping resonances, a dynamical\nphase transition takes place to which all states of the system contribute: a\nfew short-lived resonance states are aligned to the scattering states of the\nenvironment by trapping the other states. The trapped resonance states show\nchaotic features. Due to the alignment of a few states with the states of the\nenvironment, observable values may be enhanced. The dynamical phase transition\nallows us to understand some experimental results which remained puzzling in\nthe framework of conventional Hermitian quantum physics.

One area of activity\nis in creating smoothed disease maps to describe the geographic variation of\ndisease and generate hypotheses for apparent differences in risk. With multiple\ndiseases, a multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) model is often\nused to smooth across space while accounting for associations between the\ndiseases. The MCAR, however, imposes complex covariance structures that are\ndifficult to interpret and estimate. This article develops a much simpler\nalternative approach building upon the techniques of smoothed ANOVA (SANOVA).\nInstead of simply shrinking effects without any structure, here we use SANOVA\nto smooth spatial random effects by taking advantage of the spatial structure.\nWe extend SANOVA to cases in which one factor is a spatial lattice, which is\nsmoothed using a CAR model, and a second factor is, for example, type of\ncancer. Datasets routinely lack enough information to identify the additional\nstructure of MCAR. SANOVA offers a simpler and more intelligible structure than\nthe MCAR while performing as well. We demonstrate our approach with simulation\nstudies designed to compare SANOVA with different design matrices versus MCAR\nwith different priors.

Chimneys are the principal\nconduits through which buoyancy effects transport material out of the mushy\nlayer and into the liquid from which it formed. Experiments show a coarsening\nof chimney spacing and we pursue the hypothesis that this observation is a\nconsequence of a variational principle: the chimney spacing adjusts to optimize\nmaterial transport and hence maximize the rate of removal of potential energy\nstored in the mushy layer. The optimal solute flux increases approximately\nlinearly with the mushy layer Rayleigh number. However, for spacings below a\ncritical value the chimneys collapse and solute fluxes cease, revealing a\nhysteresis between chimney convection and no flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 19:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}
