Jet-driven molecular outflows play an\nimportant role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand the\nprocess of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phases\ninvolved. Observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour an\nevolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with Class 0 objects\nwhile more evolved Class I/II objects show less evidence of powerful jets. The\npresent study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in the\nhigh-mass case. The IRAM 30-m telescope (Spain) has been used to perform\nsingle-pointing SiO(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57\nhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. Continuum data at\ndifferent wavelengths, from mid-IR to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build the\nspectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometric\nluminosities. SiO emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecular\njets, is detected in 88% of our sources, a very high detection rate indicating\nthat there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the sources of our\nsample. The SiO(2-1) luminosity drops with L/M, which suggests that jet\nactivity declines as time evolves. This represents the first clear evidence of\na decrease of SiO outflow luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample of\nhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages.

One particularly promising new technique\ndemonstrated in recent experiments uses strong fluorescent laser scattering\nfrom neutral atoms confined in a short-period optical lattice to measure the\nposition of individual atoms in the sample. A crucial condition for the\nmeasurements is that atomic hopping between lattice sites must be strongly\nsuppressed despite substantial photon recoil heating. This article models\nthree-dimensional polarization gradient cooling of atoms trapped within a\nfar-detuned optical lattice. The atomic dynamics are simulated using a hybrid\nMonte Carlo and master equation analysis in order to predict the frequency of\nprocesses which give rise to degradation or loss of the fluorescent signal\nduring measurements.

It is usually assumed that these algorithms\nconverge faster with a greater exchange of information (i.e., by increased\nnetwork connectivity) in every iteration. However, when interference is taken\ninto account, it is no longer clear if the rate of convergence increases with\nnetwork connectivity. We study this problem for randomly-placed\nconsensus-seeking nodes connected through an interference-limited network. We\ninvestigate the following questions: (a) How does the rate of convergence vary\nwith increasing communication range of each node? and (b) How does this result\nchange when each node is allowed to communicate with a few selected far-off\nnodes? When nodes schedule their transmissions to avoid interference, we show\nthat the convergence speed scales with $r^{2-d}$, where $r$ is the\ncommunication range and $d$ is the number of dimensions. This scaling is the\nresult of two competing effects when increasing $r$: Increased schedule length\nfor interference-free transmission vs. the speed gain due to improved\nconnectivity. Hence, although one-dimensional networks can converge faster from\na greater communication range despite increased interference, the two effects\nexactly offset one another in two-dimensions. In higher dimensions, increasing\nthe communication range can actually degrade the rate of convergence. Our\nresults thus underline the importance of factoring in the effect of\ninterference in the design of distributed estimation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 18:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nrate region of this problem has been considered in the literature under certain\nrestrictive assumptions, particularly in terms of the network topology, the\nfunctions and the characteristics of the sources. In this paper, we present\nresults that significantly relax these assumptions. Firstly, we consider this\nproblem for an arbitrary tree network and asymptotically lossless computation.\nWe show that, for depth one trees with correlated sources, or for general trees\nwith independent sources, a modularized coding scheme based on graph colorings\nand Slepian-Wolf compression performs arbitrarily closely to rate lower bounds.\nFor a general tree network with independent sources, optimal computation to be\nperformed at intermediate nodes is derived. We introduce a necessary and\nsufficient condition on graph colorings of any achievable coding scheme, called\ncoloring connectivity condition (C.C.C.).\n  Secondly, we investigate the effect of having several functions at the\nreceiver. In this problem, we derive a rate region and propose a coding scheme\nbased on graph colorings. Thirdly, we consider the functional compression\nproblem with feedback. We show that, in this problem, unlike Slepian-Wolf\ncompression, by having feedback, one may outperform rate bounds of the case\nwithout feedback. Fourthly, we investigate functional computation problem with\ndistortion. We compute a rate-distortion region for this problem. Then, we\npropose a simple suboptimal coding scheme with a non-trivial performance\nguarantee. Finally, we introduce cases where finding minimum entropy colorings\nand therefore, optimal coding schemes can be performed in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 20:53:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 18:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

Our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in the\nnear-UV green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow range\nof near-UV/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby E+A\n(post-starburst) galaxies. We parametrise the properties of the recent star\nformation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in the\nNGC 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-UV/optical photometry to stellar\nmodels. The typical age of the recent star formation (RSF) is around 0.9 Gyrs,\nconsistent with the similarity of the near-UV colours to post-starburst\nsystems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports the\nproposed merger scenario. The RSF metallicity, representative of the\nmetallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 Zsun.\nAssuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly from\nthe infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phase\nmetallicity (GPM) of the accreted satellite. Comparison to the local mass-GPM\nrelation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around\n3x10^8 Msun, making NGC 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. A summation of the pixel RSF\nmass fractions indicates that the RSF contributes about 2-3 percent of the\nstellar mass. This work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play a\nsignificant role in the evolution of ETGs at late epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 21:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The standard\nsolution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is\nwell known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players\nincreases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where\nplayers optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others' states remains\nconstant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we\nprovide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a\nparsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that\nguarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation\nproperty to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces.\nSecond, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market\nstructure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE\nwell, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate\nthis connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples.\nThese examples show that our conditions enforce a form of \"decreasing returns\nto larger states\"; this yields fragmented industries in the limit. By contrast,\nviolation of these conditions suggests \"increasing returns to larger states\"\nand potential market concentration.

In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair --\nall parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness\nis not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility,\nGordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure\ncomputation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they\nconstruct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either\ntheir domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon\nand Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols.\n  We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general\nfunctionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when\nthe number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties\nare corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is\ndeterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security\nparameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the\nrange is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the\nfunctionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the\nnumber of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the\nnegative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant,\n1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is\npolynomial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 08:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters\nand combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation\nuses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for\nthe first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of\ngraphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a\nstandard workstation. Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of the\nshortest paths between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently approximated by\nmeans of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its index of\ndispersion provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs.\nweb graphs. We thus propose the spid (Shortest-Paths Index of Dispersion) of a\ngraph as a new, informative statistics that is able to discriminate between the\nabove two types of graphs. We believe this is the first proposal of a\nsignificant new non-local structural index for complex networks whose\ncomputation is highly scalable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 11:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 11:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

These networks are characterized\nby a complex structure, which dramatically affects how information is\ntransmitted through them. For pure quantum state links, quantum networks\nexhibit a remarkable feature absent in classical networks: it is possible to\neffectively rewire the network by performing local operations on the nodes. We\npropose a family of such quantum operations that decrease the entanglement\npercolation threshold of the network and increase the size of the giant\nconnected component. We provide analytic results for complex networks with\narbitrary (uncorrelated) degree distribution. These results are in good\nagreement with numerical simulations, which also show enhancement in correlated\nand real world networks. The proposed quantum preprocessing strategies are not\nrobust in the presence of noise. However, even when the links consist of\n(noisy) mixed state links, one can send quantum information through a\nconnecting path with a fidelity that decreases with the path length. In this\nnoisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular lattices,\nnamely the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a relatively\nsmall number of steps, known as the small world effect. We calculate the\nprobability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can successfully\ncommunicate with a fidelity above a given threshold. This amounts to working\nout the classical problem of percolation with limited path length. We find that\nthis probability can be significant even for paths limited to few connections,\nand that the results for standard (unlimited) percolation are soon recovered if\nthe path length exceeds by a finite amount the average path length, which in\ncomplex networks generally scales logarithmically with the size of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 14:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}
