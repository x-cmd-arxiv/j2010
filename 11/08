The study of these structures can give\ninformation on the conditions for particle acceleration and radiation at the\nfront shocks. In addition, an evolutionary scenario can help to disentangle the\norigin of the detected X-ray emission in young FRI sources, like some Gigahertz\nPeaked Spectrum AGNs. This work focuses on the nature and detectability of the\nradiation seen from the termination regions of evolving FRI jets. We use the\nresults of a relativistic, two-dimensional numerical simulation of the\npropagation of an FRI jet, coupled with a radiation model, to make predictions\nfor the spectra and lightcurves of the thermal and non-thermal emission at\ndifferent stages of the FRI evolution. Our results show that under moderate\nmagnetic fields, the synchrotron radiation would be the dominant non-thermal\nchannel, appearing extended in radio and more compact in X-rays, with\nrelatively small flux variations with time. The shocked jet synchrotron\nemission would dominate the X-ray band, although the shocked ISM/ICM thermal\ncomponent alone may be significant in old sources. Inverse Compton scattering\nof CMB photons could yield significant fluxes in the GeV and TeV bands, with a\nnon-negligible X-ray contribution. The IC radiation would present a bigger\nangular size in X-rays and GeV than in TeV, with fluxes increasing with time.\nWe conclude that the thermal and non-thermal broadband emission from the\ntermination regions of FRI jets could be detectable for sources located up to\ndistances of a few 100 Mpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 16:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We first describe the generic band\nstructure of an isolated FeAs layer. Use of its Abelian glide-mirror group\nallows us to reduce the primitive cell to one FeAs unit. From\ndensity-functional theory, we generate the set of eight Fe $d$ and As $p$\nlocalized Wannier functions for LaOFeAs and their tight-binding (TB)\nHamiltonian, $h(k)$. We discuss the topology of the bands, i.e. allowed and\navoided crossings, the origin of the d6 pseudogap, as well as the role of the\nAs $p$ orbitals and the elongation of the FeAs$_{4}$ tetrahedron. We then\ncouple the layers, mainly via interlayer hopping between As $p_{z}$ orbitals,\nand give the formalism for simple and body-centered tetragonal stackings. This\nallows us to explain the material-specific 3D band structures. Due to the high\nsymmetry, several level inversions take place as functions of $k_{z}$ or\npressure, resulting in linear band dispersions (Dirac cones). The underlying\nsymmetry elements are, however, easily broken, so that the Dirac points are not\nprotected, nor pinned to the Fermi level. From the paramagnetic TB Hamiltonian,\nwe form the band structures for spin spirals with wavevector $q$ by coupling\n$h(k)$ and $h (k+q)$. The band structure for stripe order is studied as a\nfunction of the exchange potential, $\\Delta$, using Stoner theory. Gapping of\nthe Fermi surface (FS) for small $\\Delta $ requires matching of FS dimensions\n(nesting) and $d$-orbital characters. The origin of the propeller-shaped FS is\nexplained. Finally, we express the magnetic energy as the sum over\nband-structure energies, which enables us to understand to what extent the\nmagnetic energies might be described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the\ninterplay between the magnetic moment and the elongation of the FeAs4\ntetrahedron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 17:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 16:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2011 03:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-18"}

Observations of high-redshift galaxies,\nwhile showing ubiquitous outflows, have so far not revealed convincing traces\nof the predicted cold streams, which has been interpreted as a challenge for\nthe current models. Using high-resolution, zoom-in smooth particle\nhydrodynamics simulations of Lyman break galaxy (LBG) halos combined with\nionizing radiative transfer, we quantify the covering factor of the cold\nstreams at z=2-4. We focus specifically on Lyman limit systems (LLSs) and\ndamped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs), which can be probed by absorption\nspectroscopy using a background galaxy or quasar sightline, and which are\nclosely related to low-ionization metal absorbers. We show that the covering\nfactor of these systems is relatively small and decreases with time. At z=2,\nthe covering factor of DLAs within the virial radius of the simulated galaxies\nis ~3% (~1% within twice this projected distance), and arises principally from\nthe galaxy itself. The corresponding values for LLSs are ~10% and ~4%. Because\nof their small covering factor compared to the order unity covering fraction\nexpected for galactic winds, the cold streams are naturally dominated by\noutflows in stacked spectra. We conclude that the existing observations are\nconsistent with the predictions of cold mode accretion, and outline promising\nkinematic and chemical diagnostics to separate out the signatures of galactic\naccretion and feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 01:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 04:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Several\nnumerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speed\nvaries with heat flux and viscosity, but no previous theories have been\nadvanced to explain these trends. Here, we show using simple arguments that if\nconvective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them,\nthe mean jet speeds split into two regimes. When the convection is weakly\nnonlinear, the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with F/nu,\nwhere F is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity. When the\nconvection is strongly nonlinear, the jet speeds are faster and should scale\napproximately as (F/nu)^{1/2}. We demonstrate how this regime shift can\nnaturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiency\nwith heat flux and viscosity. Moreover, the simulations hint at a third regime\nwhere, at sufficiently small viscosities, the jet speed becomes independent of\nthe viscosity. We show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regime\nexists, mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power. Our\nscalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previous\nBoussinesq and anelastic, three-dimensional simulations of convection within\ngiant planets over a broad range of parameters. When extrapolated to the real\nheat fluxes, these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in the\nmolecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker--by an order of\nmagnitude or more--than the speeds measured at cloud level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 05:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Using a variational method, we can calculate several\ndiscrete quantities such as the position and the area of spectral peaks for\nlow-lying states.

In high\nmagnetic field the current is usually injected to the arm of the ring preferred\nby classical magnetic forces. However, for narrow magnetic field intervals that\nappear periodically on the magnetic field scale the current is injected to the\nother arm of the ring. We indicate that the appearance of the anomalous --\nnon-classical -- current circulation results from Fano interference involving\nlocalized resonant states. The identification of the Fano interference is based\non the comparison of the solution of the scattering problem with the results of\nthe stabilization method. The latter employs the bound-state type calculations\nand allows to extract both the energy of metastable states localized within the\nring and the width of resonances by analysis of the energy spectrum of a finite\nsize system in function of its length. The Fano resonances involving states of\nanomalous current circulation become extremely narrow on both magnetic field\nand energy scales. This is consistent with the orientation of the Lorentz force\nthat tends to keep the electron within the ring and thus increases the lifetime\nof the electron localization within the ring.

Gradual ageing\nof both the surface activity and the weak-contact reconfigurations is observed\nas a result of repeated tilt cycles up to a given angle smaller than the angle\nof avalanche. For an aged configuration reached after several consecutive tilt\ncycles, abrupt resumption of the on-surface activity and of the weak-contact\nrearrangements occurs when the packing is subsequently inclined beyond the\nprevious maximal tilting angle. This behavior is compared with literature\nresults from numerical simulations of inclined 2D packings. It is also found\nthat the aged weak-contact configurations exhibit spontaneous restoration\ntowards the initial state if the packing remains at rest for tens of minutes.\nWhen the packing is titled forth and back between zero and near-critical\nangles, instead of ageing, the weak-contact configuration exhibits \"internal\nweak-contact avalanches\" in the vicinity of both the near-critical and zero\nangles.

A problem of\nconsiderable interest is that of estimating the \"Transcription Regulation\nNetworks\" (TRN) relating the TFs and genes. While the expression levels of\ngenes can be observed, the activation levels of the corresponding TFs are\nusually unknown, greatly increasing the difficulty of the problem. Based on\nprevious experimental work, it is often the case that partial information about\nthe TRN is available. For example, certain TFs may be known to regulate a given\ngene or in other cases a connection may be predicted with a certain\nprobability. In general, the biology of the problem indicates there will be\nvery few connections between TFs and genes. Several methods have been proposed\nfor estimating TRNs. However, they all suffer from problems such as unrealistic\nassumptions about prior knowledge of the network structure or computational\nlimitations. We propose a new approach that can directly utilize prior\ninformation about the network structure in conjunction with observed gene\nexpression data to estimate the TRN.

We illustrate this\nusing recent relativistic MHD simulations of the Crab Nebula and also show that\nthe observed size, shape, and distance from the pulsar of the Crab Nebula inner\nknot are consistent with its interpretation as a Doppler-boosted emission from\nthe termination shock. If the electrons responsible for the synchrotron\ngamma-rays are accelerated only at the termination shock then their short\nlife-time ensures that these gamma-rays originate close to the shock and are\nalso strongly effected by the Doppler beaming. As the result, bulk of the\nobserved synchrotron gamma-rays of the Crab Nebula around 100 MeV may come from\nits inner knot. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed optical flux of\nthe inner knot provided its optical-gamma spectral index is the same as the\ninjection spectral index found in the Kennel & Coroniti model of the nebula\nspectrum. The observed variability of synchrotron gamma-ray emission can be\ncaused by the instability of the termination shock discovered in recent\nnumerical simulations. Given the small size of the knot, it is possible that\nthe September 2010 gamma-ray flare of the Crab Nebula also came from the knot,\nthough the actual mechanism remains unclear.

The study is carried out for both\nthe one-dimensional Burgers equation and the two-dimensional incompressible\nEuler equation. For large $K_G$ and smooth initial conditions, the first\nsymptom of truncation, a localized short-wavelength oscillation which we call a\n\"tyger\", is caused by a resonant interaction between fluid particle motion and\ntruncation waves generated by small-scale features (shocks, layers with strong\nvorticity gradients, etc). Tygers appear when complex-space singularities come\nwithin one Galerkin wavelength $\\lambdag = 2\\pi/K_G$ from the real domain and\narise far away from preexisting small-scale structures at locations whose\nvelocities match that of such structures. Tygers are weak and strongly\nlocalized at first - in the Burgers case at the time of appearance of the first\nshock their amplitudes and widths are proportional to $K_G^{-2/3}$ and $K_G\n^{-1/3}$ respectively - but grow and eventually invade the whole flow. They are\nthus the first manifestations of the thermalization predicted by T.D.

This leads to\nReynolds stresses acting on scales larger than the Galerkin wavelength and\nprevents the flow from converging to the inviscid-limit solution.

State estimators are\ncommonly used in power networks, for example, to detect faulty equipment and to\noptimally route power flows. The estimators are often located in control\ncenters, to which large numbers of measurements are sent over unencrypted\ncommunication channels. Therefore cyber security for state estimators becomes\nan important issue. In this paper we analyze the cyber security of state\nestimators in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for energy\nmanagement systems (EMS) operating the power network. Current EMS state\nestimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers\nin the measurement data. Such schemes are based on high measurement redundancy.\nAlthough these methods may detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail\nin the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by\nconsidering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending\nfalse information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent\nframework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the\nobjective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to\nthe attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a\nstate-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14\nsubstations, 27 buses, and 40 branches.

In\nparticular, minute temperature changes of the fluid solvent, which provides the\nnear-critical thermal fluctuations, lead to a significant change of the range\nand strength of the effective interaction among the solute particles. This\nfeature allows one to control, e.g., the aggregation of colloidal dispersions\nor the spatial distribution of colloids in the presence of chemically or\ntopographically patterned substrates. The spatial direction of the effective\nforce acting on a solute particle depends only on the surface properties of the\nimmersed particles and can be spatially modulated by suitably patterned\nsurfaces.
