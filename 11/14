As a result, this\nbackground radiation can drive the evaporation of circumstellar disks and lead\nto the loss of planet forming potential within a cluster. This paper presents a\ndetailed analysis of this process for clusters whose stellar membership falls\nwithin the range $100 \\le N \\le 1000$. For these intermediate-sized clusters,\nthe background UV field is often dominated by the most massive stellar member.\nDue to the steep slope of the initial mass function, the amount of background\nUV light that bathes clusters of similar size displays significant variance.

Fluid Mech","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"nlin.CD","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  In the Nastrom-Gage spectrum of atmospheric turbulence we observe a $k^{-3}$\nenergy spectrum that transitions into a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, with increasing\nwavenumber $k$. The transition occurs near a transition wavenumber $k_t$,\nlocated near the Rossby deformation wavenumber $k_R$. The Tung-Orlando theory\ninterprets this spectrum as a double downscale cascade of potential enstrophy\nand energy, from large scales to small scales, in which the downscale potential\nenstrophy cascade coexists with the downscale energy cascade over the same\nlength-scale range. We show that, in a temperature forced two-layer\nquasi-geostrophic model, the rates with which potential enstrophy and energy\nare injected place the transition wavenumber $k_t$ near $k_R$. We also show\nthat if the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy in the forcing range,\nthen the Ekman term suppresses the upscale cascading potential enstrophy more\nthan it suppresses the upscale cascading energy, a behavior contrary to what\noccurs in two-dimensional turbulence. As a result, the ratio $\\gn/\\gee$ of\ninjected potential enstrophy over injected energy, in the downscale direction,\ndecreases, thereby tending to decrease the transition wavenumber $k_t$ further.\nUsing a random Gaussian forcing model, we reach the same conclusion, under the\nmodeling assumption that the asymmetric Ekman term predominantly suppresses the\nbottom layer forcing, thereby disregarding a possible entanglement between the\nEkman term and the nonlinear interlayer interaction. Based on these results, we\nargue that the Tung-Orlando theory can account for the approximate coincidence\nbetween $k_t$ and $k_R$.

This paper presents a robust contour tracking method by contributing to\nsome of the key issues involved, including (a) a region functional formulation\nand its optimization; (b) design of a robust and effective feature; and (c)\ndevelopment of an integrated tracking algorithm. First, we formulate a region\nfunctional based on robust Earth Mover's distance (EMD) with kernel density for\ndistribution modeling, and propose a two-phase method for its optimization. In\nthe first phase, letting the candidate contour be fixed, we express EMD as the\ntransportation problem and solve it by the simplex algorithm. Next, using the\ntheory of shape derivative, we make a perturbation analysis of the contour\naround the best solution to the transportation problem. This leads to a partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) that governs the contour evolution. Second, we\ndesign a novel and effective feature for tracking applications. We propose a\ndimensionality reduction method by tensor decomposition, achieving a\nlow-dimensional description of SIFT features called Tensor-SIFT for\ncharacterizing local image region properties. Applicable to both color and\ngray-level images, Tensor-SIFT is very distinctive, insensitive to illumination\nchanges, and noise. Finally, we develop an integrated algorithm that combines\nvarious techniques of the simplex algorithm, narrow-band level set and fast\nmarching algorithms.

Our scheme has an constant\nstorage overhead (the number of nodes responsible for servicing a data item)\nand an $O(\\log N)$ overhead (messages and time) per insertion and essentially\nno overhead for deletions. All these bounds are essentially optimal. While DHT\nschemes with similar guarantees are already known in the literature, this work\nis new in the following aspects:\n  (1) It presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the scheme under a\ngeneral stochastic model of churn and shows the above guarantees;\n  (2) The theoretical analysis is complemented by a simulation-based analysis\nthat validates the asymptotic bounds even in moderately sized networks and also\nstudies performance under changing stable network size;\n  (3) The presented scheme seems especially suitable for maintaining dynamic\nstructures under churn efficiently. In particular, we show that a spanning tree\nof low diameter can be efficiently maintained in constant time and logarithmic\nnumber of messages per insertion or deletion w.h.p.\n  Keywords: P2P Network, DHT Scheme, Churn, Dynamic Spanning Tree, Stochastic\nAnalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2010 04:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 21:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

This\nphase is characterized by the aggregation of the holes into rows and columns,\nwhich in turn results in two internal fields. The first is the modulated AFM\nfield, whose main evidence comes from Neutron scattering experiments. The\nsecond internal field is made up by the checkerboard charge density waves that\nhave been observed by Scanning Tunneling Measurements. The present paper deals\nmainly with the internal field of the first type, and discusses the second type\nonly tentatively.

In active galactic nuclei of blazar type, these variations are the most\ndramatic. By following blazar outbursts from their onset and by correlating the\nobserved variations at many different wavelengths we can reconstruct the\nbehavior of the plasma and map out the development of the flare within the jet.\nThe advent of the Fermi satellite has allowed the start of a systematic and\nintensive monitoring program of blazars. Blazar outbursts are very effectively\ndetected by the LAT instrument in the MeV-GeV domain, and these can be promptly\nfollowed up with other facilities. Based on a Fermi LAT detection of a high\nMeV-GeV state, we have observed the blazar PKS 1502+106 with the INTEGRAL\nsatellite between 9 and 11 August 2008. Simultaneous Swift observations have\nbeen also accomplished, as well as optical follow-up at the Nordic Optical\nTelescope. The IBIS instrument onboard INTEGRAL detected a source at a position\ninconsistent with the optical coordinates of PKS 1502+106, but consistent with\nthose of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 841, located at 6.8 arcmin south-west from\nthe blazar, which is therefore responsible for all the hard X-ray flux detected\nby IBIS. At the location of the blazar, IBIS sets an upper limit of ~10^{-11}\nerg/s/cm2 on the 15-60 keV flux, that turns out to be consistent with a model\nof inverse Compton scattering accounting for the soft X-ray and gamma-ray\nspectra measured by Swift XRT and Fermi LAT, respectively. The gamma-ray\nspectrum during the outburst indicates substantial variability of the\ncharacteristic energy of the inverse Compton component in this\nblazar.(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2010 12:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Nevertheless there are\nmultiple attempts to define running couplings including the effects of gravity,\nwith varying conclusions. We sort through many of the issues involved, most\nparticularly the idea of operator mixing and also the kinematics of crossing,\nusing calculations in Yukawa and lambda phi^4 theory as illustrative examples.\nWe remain in the perturbative regime. In some theories with a high permutation\nsymmetry, such as lambda phi^4, a reasonable running coupling can be defined.\nHowever in most cases, such as Yukawa and gauge theories, a running coupling\nfails to correctly account for the energy dependence of the interaction\nstrength. As a byproduct we also contrast on-shell and off-shell renormalizaton\nschemes and show that operators which are normally discarded, such as those\nthat vanish by the equations of motion, are required for off-shell\nrenormalization of effective field theories.
