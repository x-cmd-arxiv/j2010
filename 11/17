In this paper, we show how to exploit the mode entanglement of just a\nsingle particle for the teleportation of an unknown quantum state of a spatial\nmode. We detail how to overcome the superselection rule to create any initial\nquantum state and how to perform Bell state analysis on two of the modes. We\nshow that two of the four Bell states can always be reliably distinguished,\nwhile the other two have to be grouped together due to an unsatisfied phase\nmatching condition.

We present results\nfrom our four Chandra and seven Swift observations that covered this outburst.\nX-ray transient behaviour is generally caused by one of two things: mass\naccretion from a high mass companion during some restricted phase range in the\norbital cycle, or disc instability in a low mass system. We aim to exploit\nEinstein, HST, Chandra and Swift observations to determine the nature of XMMU\nJ004215.8+411924. We model the 2010 May spectrum, and use the results to\nconvert from intensity to counts in the fainter Chandra observations, as well\nas the Swift observations; these data are used to create a lightcurve. We also\nestimate the flux in the 1979 January 13 Einstein observation. Additionally, we\nsearch for an optical counterpart in HST data. Our best X-ray positions from\nthe 2006 and 2010 outbursts are 0.3\" apart, and 1.6\" from the Einstein source;\nthese outbursts are likely to come from the same star system. We see no\nevidence for an optical counterpart with m_B < ~25.5; this new limit is 3.5\nmagnitudes fainter than the existing one. Furthermore, we see no V band\ncounterpart with m_V < ~26. The local absorption is ~7 times higher than the\nGalactic line-of-sight, and provides ~2 magnitudes of extinction in the V band.\nHence M_V > ~ -0.5. Fits to the X-ray emission spectrum suggest a black hole\nprimary. We find that XMMU J004215.8+411924 is most likely to be a transient\nLMXB, rather than a HMXB as originaly proposed. The nature of the primary is\nunclear, although we argue that a black hole is likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 16:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$. The result is $S_C=S_A+S_B+\\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2}}\nG(R_1,R_2)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside\nregion of $A$ and $B$, and $G(R_1,R_2) \\leq 0$. We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case.

We illustrate this on the basis of several examples: a small\nperturbation propagating down a steady string, a massless particle falling into\nAdS_5, and the decay of a time-like wave-packet. A similar observation was made\nin Phys. Rev. D81 (2010) 126001 for the case of a rotating string. In all these\ncases, the absence of broadening is related to the fact that the energy\nbackreaction on the boundary arises exclusively from the bulk perturbation at,\nor near, the boundary. This is so since bulk sources which propagate in AdS_5\nat the speed of light do not generate any energy on the boundary. We interpret\nthese features as an artifact of the supergravity approximation, which fails to\nencode quantum mechanical fluctuations that should be present even in the\nstrong coupling limit.

These whirlpool-like flows are characterized by very strong horizontal\nvelocities (7 - 11 km/s) and downflows (~ 7 km/s), and are accompanied by\nstrong decreases of the temperature, density and pressure at the surface and in\na ~ 0.5-1 Mm deep layer below the surface. High-speed whirlpool flows can\nattract and capture other vortices. According to our simulation results, the\nprocesses of the vortex interaction, such as vortex annihilation, can cause the\nexcitation of acoustic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 18:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 19:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 17:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this paper, we investigate, by\nmeans of numerical N-body computations, the orbital evolution of the stellar\ndisc, which we consider to be initially thin. We include the gravitational\ninfluence of both the torus and the late-type stars, as well as the\nself-gravity of the disc. Our results show that, for a significant set of\nsystem parameters, the evolution of the disc leads, within the lifetime of the\nearly-type stars, to a configuration compatible with the observations. In\nparticular, the disc naturally reaches a specific - perpendicular - orientation\nwith respect to the torus, which is indeed the configuration observed in the\nGalactic centre. We, therefore, suggest that all the early-type stars may have\nbeen born within a single gaseous disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In particular, it is found that for\nwaves originating from outside of the sunspot, p-mode waves travel across the\nsunspot with a small amplitude reduction and slightly higher speed, and wave\namplitude and phase get mostly restored to the quiet-Sun values after passing\nthe sunspot.

In this theory, the sensing mechanism simply selects sensing vectors\nindependently at random from a probability distribution F; it includes all\nmodels - e.g. Gaussian, frequency measurements - discussed in the literature,\nbut also provides a framework for new measurement strategies as well. We prove\nthat if the probability distribution F obeys a simple incoherence property and\nan isotropy property, one can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals\nfrom a minimal number of noisy measurements. The novelty is that our recovery\nresults do not require the restricted isometry property (RIP) - they make use\nof a much weaker notion - or a random model for the signal. As an example, the\npaper shows that a signal with s nonzero entries can be faithfully recovered\nfrom about s log n Fourier coefficients that are contaminated with noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 23:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 05:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 22:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

Our results are obtained without using the rotating wave\napproximation (RWA), and the initial state (a dressed state) is easy to\nprepare. When the central frequency of the cavity mode is resonant with the\nqubit energy level spacing, the normalized decay rate of the qubit is lower\nthan 1, which manifests the QZE. However, when the cavity frequency is detuned\nfrom resonance, the normalized decay rate becomes larger than 1, which\ncorresponds to the AZE. The change from the QZE to the AZE, by just varying the\ncentral frequency of the cavity mode, should allow to distinguish these two\ndifferent effects. Moreover, we find that in the presence of both qubit's\nintrinsic bath and the cavity bath, the emergence of the QZE and the AZE\nbehaviors relies not only on the match between the qubit energy level spacing\nand the central frequency of the cavity mode, but also on the coupling strength\nbetween the qubit and the cavity mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 01:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 05:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In the\nstandard approach to cosmology it is assumed that this relation is the same as\nin the homogeneous universe. As the real universe is not homogeneous there are\nseveral methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and\nthe Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between\nthese two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with\nonly small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of\nsight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a\nvanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of\ndensity fluctuations along the line of sight is zero. In this case, even within\nthe linear approximation, the distance correction is not negligible. The\nmodified version of the Dyer-Roeder relation is presented and it is shown that\nthis modified relation is consistent with the correction obtained within the\nweak lensing approximation. The correction to the distance for a source at z ~\n2 is of order of a few percent. Thus, with an increasing precision of\ncosmological observations an accurate estimation of the distance is essential.\nOtherwise errors due to miscalculation the distance can become a major source\nof systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 03:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It is well-known that there exists\na critical coupling strength among the oscillators at which a phase transition\nfrom incoherency to synchronization occurs. This paper features four\ncontributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of\nsynchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the\nconcept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for\nsynchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary,\nsufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength\nfor finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto\nmodels. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition\non the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional\nKuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The\nmultiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical\nstability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate\nphase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order\nparameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto\nmodels consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous\ndamping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time\nconstants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically\nconjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and\nwe present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase\nsynchronization and local frequency synchronization.

By enabling nodes to detect malicious behaviors probabilistically and\nuse overheard messages to police their downstream neighbors locally, the\nalgebraic watchdog delivers a secure global self-checking network. Unlike\ntraditional Byzantine detection protocols which are receiver-based, this\nprotocol gives the senders an active role in checking the node downstream. The\nkey idea is inspired by Marti et al.'s watchdog-pathrater, which attempts to\ndetect and mitigate the effects of routing misbehavior.\n  As an initial building block of a such system, we first focus on a two-hop\nnetwork. We present a graphical model to understand the inference process nodes\nexecute to police their downstream neighbors; as well as to compute, analyze,\nand approximate the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. In\naddition, we present an algebraic analysis of the performance using an\nhypothesis testing framework that provides exact formulae for probabilities of\nfalse detection and misdetection.\n  We then extend the algebraic watchdog to a more general network setting, and\npropose a protocol in which we can establish trust in coded systems in a\ndistributed manner. We develop a graphical model to detect the presence of an\nadversarial node downstream within a general multi-hop network. The structure\nof the graphical model (a trellis) lends itself to well-known algorithms, such\nas the Viterbi algorithm, which can compute the probabilities of misdetection\nand false detection. We show analytically that as long as the min-cut is not\ndominated by the Byzantine adversaries, upstream nodes can monitor downstream\nneighbors and allow reliable communication with certain probability.

In the\ncontinuum limit, the random environment is represented by a `stochastic flow of\nkernels', which is a collection of random kernels that can be loosely\ninterpreted as the transition probabilities of a Markov process in a random\nenvironment. The theory of stochastic flows of kernels was introduced by Le Jan\nand Raimond, who showed that each such flow is characterized by its n-point\nmotions. We focus on a class of stochastic flows of kernels with Brownian\nn-point motions which, after their inventors, will be called Howitt-Warren\nflows. We give a graphical construction of general Howitt-Warren flows, where\nthe underlying random environment takes on the form of a suitably marked\nBrownian web. Alternatively, we show that a special subclass of the\nHowitt-Warren flows can be constructed as random flows of mass in a Brownian\nnet. Using these constructions, we prove some new results for the Howitt-Warren\nflows. In particular, we show that the kernels spread with a finite speed and\nhave a locally finite support at deterministic times if and only if the flow is\nembeddable in a Brownian net. We show that the kernels are always purely atomic\nat deterministic times, but with the exception of a special subclass known as\nthe erosion flows, exhibit random times when the kernels are purely non-atomic.\nWe moreover prove ergodic statements for a class of measure-valued processes\ninduced by the Howitt-Warren flows.

The XFEL output intensity contains an\noscillating \"mode-beat\" component whose frequency is related to the frequency\ndifference between the pair of longitudinal modes considered. At saturation one\nobtains FEL-induced modulations of energy loss and energy spread in the\nelectron bunch at optical frequency, which can be converted into density\nmodulation at the same optical frequency using a weak chicane installed behind\nthe baseline undulator. Powerful coherent radiation can then be generated with\nthe help of an optical transition radiation (OTR) station. We also consider how\nthe doublet structure of the XFEL generation spectra can be monitored by an\noptical spectrometer. The OTR coherent radiation pulse is naturally\nsynchronized with the X-ray pulses, and can be used for timing the XFEL to high\npower conventional lasers with femtosecond accuracy for pump-probe\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 09:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The partonic production mechanism of the final-state system can be\ncontrolled by quark-antiquark (qqbar) annihilation and/or by gluon fusion.

In this framework, we discuss the effects of recent improvements in\nrelevant reaction rates for proton captures on intermediate-mass nuclei (from\ncarbon to aluminum). For each nucleus we briefly discuss the new choices and\ntheir motivations. The calculations are then performed on the basis of a\nparameterized circulation, where the effects of the new nuclear inputs are best\ncompared to previous works. We find that the new rates (and notably the one for\nthe 14N(p,g)15O reaction) imply considerable modifications in the composition\nof post-main sequence stars. In particular, the slight temperature changes due\nto the reduced efficiency of proton captures on 14N induce abundance variations\nat the first dredge up (especially for 17O, whose equilibrium ratio to 16O is\nvery sensitive to the temperature). In this new scenario presolar oxide grains\nof AGB origin turn out to be produced almost exclusively by very-low mass stars\n(M<=1.5-1.7Msun), never becoming C-rich. The whole population of grains with\n18O/16O below 0.0015 (the limit permitted by first dredge up) is now explained.\nAlso, there is now no forbidden area for very low values of 17O/16O (below\n0.0005), contrary to previous findings. A rather shallow type of transport\nseems to be sufficient for the CNO changes in RGB stages. Both thermohaline\ndiffusion and magnetic-buoyancy-induced mixing might provide a suitable\nphysical mechanism for this. Thermohaline mixing is in any case certainly\ninadequate to account for the production of 26Al on the AGB. Other transport\nmechanisms must therefore be at play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2010 12:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 13:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 10:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

While this is the simplest\nmodel, there is a need to consider other well motivated theories of halo\nformation. In this paper, we study a different halo model, that of self similar\ninfall which is characterized by the presence of a number of cold streams and\ncaustics, not seen in simulations. It is shown that the self similar infall\nmodel is consistent with the DAMA result both in amplitude and in phase, for\nWIMP masses exceeding $\\approx$ 250 GeV at the 99.7% confidence level. Adding a\nsmall thermal component makes the parameter space near $m_\\chi$ = 12 GeV\nconsistent with the self similar model. The minimum $\\chi^2$ per degree of\nfreedom is found to be 0.92(1.03) with(without) channeling taken into account,\nindicating an acceptable fit. For WIMP masses much greater than the mass of the\ntarget nucleus, the recoil rate depends only on the ratio $\\sigma_{\\rm\np}/m_\\chi$ which is found to be $\\approx$ 0.06 femtobarn/TeV.

The\nframework naturally incorporates Langevin dynamics to compute the most probable\ntrajectory of the protein.
