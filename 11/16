In the\nfirst problem, we have to build a data structure based on a pattern p of length\nm over an alphabet of size sigma such that we can answer to the following\nquery: given a text T of length n, where each character is encoded using\nlog(sigma) bits return the positions of all the occurrences of p in T (in the\nfollowing we refer by occ to the number of reported occurrences). For the\nmulti-pattern matching problem we have a set S of d patterns of total length m\nand a query on a text T consists in finding all positions of all occurrences in\nT of the patterns in S. As each character of the text is encoded using log\nsigma bits and we can read w bits in constant time in the RAM model, we assume\nthat we can read up to (w/log sigma) consecutive characters of the text in one\ntime step. This implies that the fastest possible query time for both problems\nis O((n(log sigma/w)+occ). In this paper we present several different results\nfor both problems which come close to that best possible query time.

In addition, we show that the state of matter\nand the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect\nthe precessional value. For example, a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) Dwarf Novae\n(DN) non-magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can\nbe described by a retrogradely precessing, differentially rotating, tilted\ndisc. Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the\ntilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the\ndisc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the\ninnermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al.\n(2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be\ngenerated instead of an inner ring. Therefore, we show that retrograde\nprecession in non-magnetic, spinning, tilted CV DN systems can equally be\ndescribed by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating disc with an\nattached retrogradely precessing inner spiral density wave so long as the wave\nappears at the same radius as the ring and within the plane of the tilted disc.\nWe find that the theoretical results generated in this work agree well with the\ntheoretical results presented in Montgomery (2009a) and thus with the numerical\nsimulations and select CV DN systems in Montgomery (2009b) that may have a main\nsequence secondary. Therefore, pressure effects do need to be considered in CV\nDN systems that exhibit negative superhumps if the accretion discs are tilted\nand have an inner spiral density wave that is in the plane of the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 16:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Until now, however, the timescale over which this process happens\nremained very poorly constrained. Using recently-measured turbulent mixing\nrates for fingering convection, I provide reliable numerical and\nsemi-analytical estimates for the rate at which the added heavy elements drain\ninto the interior. I find that the relative metallicity enhancement post-infall\ndrops by a factor of ten over a timescale which depends only on the structure\nof the host star, and decreases very rapidly with increasing stellar mass (from\nabout 1Gyr for a 1.3M_sun star to 10Myr for a 1.5M_sun star). This result\noffers an elegant explanation to the lack of observed trend between metallicity\nand convection zone mass in planet-bearing stars. More crucially, it strongly\nsuggests that the statistically-higher metallicity of planet-bearing stars must\nbe of primordial origin.

Such asymmetry led us to suggest\nthat the early ingress in the UV light curve of WASP-12b, compared to the\noptical observations, is caused by a shock around the planet, and that shocks\nshould be a common feature in transiting systems. Here, we classify all the\ntransiting systems known to date according to their potential for producing\nshocks that could cause observable light curve asymmetries. We found that 36/92\nof known transiting systems would lie above a reasonable detection threshold\nand that the most promising candidates to present shocks are: WASP-19b,\nWASP-4b, WASP-18b, CoRoT-7b, HAT-P-7b, CoRoT-1b, TrES-3, and WASP-5b. For\nprograde planets orbiting outside the co-rotation radius of fast rotating\nstars, the shock position, instead of being ahead of the planetary motion as in\nWASP-12b, trails the planet.

We show that CoRoT-11b is a\npotential candidate to host such a behind shock and show a late egress. If\nobserved, these asymmetries can provide constraints on planetary magnetic\nfields. For instance, for a planet that has a magnetic field intensity similar\nto Jupiter's field (~ 14 G) orbiting a star whose magnetic field is between 1\nand 100G, the stand-off distance between the shock and the planet, which we\ntake to be the size of the planet's magnetosphere, ranges from 1 to 40\nplanetary radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 17:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The analysis of\n{\\alpha}-helical folding in the framework of diffusion in a reduced\n(one-dimensional) free energy landscape further shows that the salt not only\nspecifically modifies equilibrium properties, but also induces kinetic barriers\ndue to individual ion binding. In the sodium salts, for instance, the peptide's\nconfigurational mobility (or \"diffusivity\") can decrease about one order of\nmagnitude. This study demonstrates the highly specific action of ions and\nhighlights the intimate coupling of intramolecular friction and solvent effects\nin protein folding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 18:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-08"}

Hence, it can be used for GPS-free node localisation as\nwell as minimum distance packet forwarding.

In this\npaper, we first provide the theory for justifying the use of the above edge\nweights.

In the last few years, these stars have been\nproposed as the direct progenitors of some core-collapse supernovae (SNe),\nparticularly Type IIn SNe, in conflict with stellar evolution theory. In this\npaper we investigate various scenarios wherein LBV stars have been suggested as\nthe immediate progenitors of SNe. Many of these suggestions stem from the fact\nthat the SNe appear to be expanding in a high density medium, which has been\ninterpreted as resulting from a wind with a high mass-loss rate. Others arise\ndue to perceived similarities between the SN characteristics and those of LBVs.\nOnly in the case of SN 2005gl do we find a valid possibility for an LBV-like\nprogenitor. Other scenarios encounter various levels of difficulty. The\nevidence that points to LBVs as direct core-collapse SNe progenitors is far\nfrom convincing. High mass-loss rates are often deduced by making assumptions\nregarding the wind parameters, which are contradicted by the results\nthemselves. A high density need not necessarily imply a high wind mass-loss\nrate: wind shocks sweeping up the surrounding medium may give a high density\nshell with a low associated wind mass-loss rate. High densities may also arise\ndue to wind clumps, or due to a previous LBV phase before the SN explodes as a\nWolf-Rayet star. Some Type IIn SNe appear to signify more a phase in the life\nof a SN than a class of SNe, and may arise from more than one type of\nprogenitor. A Wolf-Rayet phase that lasts for a few thousand years or less\ncould be one of the more probable progenitors of Type IIns, and channels for\ncreating short-lived W-R phases are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 19:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We have\napplied the algorithm to the daily analysis (every 12h) from 1958-2010,\nbuilding an extended climatology of waves packets with different spectral\nproperties. We show that wave packets characteristics over Northern Hemisphere\nexhibit a strong seasonal dependence, both in their spectral component and in\ntheir distribution and localization. The maximum activity is reached in the\ncold months, from autumn to spring, with a slight weakening in mid-winter and a\nclear minimum of activity in summer. Preferential areas of genesis are shown to\nbe the Western and Central-Pacific and Western-Atlantic while areas of lyses\nare the eastern borders of Pacific and Atlantic. We envisage possible\napplications of this algorithm also for predictability studies and operational\nactivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 01:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 19:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

In this paper\nwe recast the incompressible (constant density) Navier-Stokes equations (with\nthe velocity prescribed at the boundary) as an equivalent system, for the\nprimary variables velocity and pressure. We do this in the usual way away from\nthe boundaries, by replacing the incompressibility condition on the velocity by\na Poisson equation for the pressure.

Only the scalar of the highest isospin can couple to\nthe relevant fermions while only the scalar of the lowest isospin can directly\ndevelop a naturally small vacuum expectation value (VEV).

When gravity is switched off the theory becomes the usual non-linear\nelectrodynamics with a general structure function. The Einstein-Maxwell theory\ncan be recovered by sending some of the parameters of the defining potential to\nzero, but for any generic choice of the potential the theory is\nindistinguishable from Einstein-Maxwell at low energies. A real theory is\nobtained by imposing suitable reality conditions. We also study the\nspherically-symmetric solution and show how the usual Reissner-Nordstrom\nsolution is recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 10:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-28"}

Rev. A 82, 012316 (2010)] to higher counting bases. The\nalgorithm makes use of qubits, qutrits, and qudits to count numbers in a base\n2, base 3, or base d representation. In operating the algorithm, the number n <\nN = d^K is read into a K-qudit register through its interaction with a stream\nof n particles passing in a nearby wire; this step corresponds to a quantum\nFourier transformation from the Hilbert space of particles to the Hilbert space\nof qudit states. An inverse quantum Fourier transformation provides the number\nn in the base d representation; the inverse transformation is fully quantum at\nthe level of individual qudits, while a simpler semi-classical version can be\nused on the level of qudit registers. Combining registers of qubits, qutrits,\nand qudits, where d is a prime number, with a simpler single-shot measurement\nallows to find the powers of 2, 3, and other primes d in the number n. We show,\nthat the counting task naturally leads to the shift operation and an algorithm\nbased on the quantum Fourier transformation.

CO molecular shell is well coincident\nwith the partial shell of the SNR detected in radio continuum observations. The\nbroad emission lines and three 1720-MHz OH masers were detected in CO molecular\nshell. The present observations have provided further evidence in support of\nthe interaction between the SNR and the adjoining molecular clouds (MCs). The\ntotal mass of the MCs is 9.26*10^{3} sun masses. The integrated CO line\nintensity ratio I(CO(3-2))/I(CO(2-1)) for the whole molecular cloud is between\n0.79 and 3.40. The average value is 1.58, which is much higher than previous\nmeasurements of individual Galactic MCs. Higher line ratios imply that shocks\nhave driven into the MCs. We conclude that high I(CO(3-2))/I(CO(2-1)) is\nidentified as one good signature of SNR-MCs interacting system.
