Traditionally, these two regimes have been considered to reflect the\nexistence of two kinds of spatiotemporal instabilities of a fluid jet, the\ndripping regime corresponding to an absolutely unstable jet and the jetting\nregime to a convectively unstable jet. Here, we present quantitative\nmeasurements of the dripping and jetting regimes, both in an unforced and a\nforced state, and compare these measurements with recent theoretical studies of\nspatiotemporal instability of a confined liquid jet in a co-flowing liquid.

Bayesian inference for these models typically\nrelies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. However, even\nsophisticated MCMC methods dedicated to SSSM can prove quite inefficient as\nthey update potentially strongly correlated discrete-valued latent variables\none-at-a-time (Carter and Kohn, 1996; Gerlach et al., 2000; Giordani and Kohn,\n2008). Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods are a recently\ndeveloped class of MCMC algorithms which use particle filters to build\nefficient proposal distributions in high-dimensions (Andrieu et al., 2010). The\nexisting PMCMC methods of Andrieu et al. (2010) are applicable to SSSM, but are\nrestricted to employing standard particle filtering techniques. Yet, in the\ncontext of discrete-valued latent variables, specialised particle techniques\nhave been developed which can outperform by up to an order of magnitude\nstandard methods (Fearnhead, 1998; Fearnhead and Clifford, 2003; Fearnhead,\n2004). In this paper we develop a novel class of PMCMC methods relying on these\nvery efficient particle algorithms. We establish the theoretical validy of this\nnew generic methodology referred to as discrete PMCMC and demonstrate it on a\nvariety of examples including a multiple change-points model for well-log data\nand a model for U.S./U.K. exchange rate data. Discrete PMCMC algorithms are\nshown to outperform experimentally state-of-the-art MCMC techniques for a fixed\ncomputational complexity. Additionally they can be easily parallelized (Lee et\nal., 2010) which allows further substantial gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 17:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

Several pieces of evidence are found to support their\ninterpretation in terms of the fundamental standing longitudinal slow mode. The\nhigh excitation rate of these oscillations in small- or micro-flares suggest\nthat the slow mode waves are a natural response of the coronal plasma to\nimpulsive heating in closed magnetic structure. The strong damping and the\nrapid excitation of the observed waves are two major aspects of the waves that\nare poorly understood, and are the main subject of theoretical modeling. The\nslow waves are found mainly damped by thermal conduction and viscosity in hot\ncoronal loops. The mode coupling seems to play an important role in rapid\nexcitation of the standing slow mode.

We improve on\nprevious work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by\ndistinguishing accretion onto haloes and galaxies, by including important\nfeedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. The\nspecific rate of gas accretion onto haloes is, like that for dark matter, only\nweakly dependent on halo mass.

Galactic winds increase the halo mass at\nwhich the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to\nMhalo~10^12 Msun. Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures\neither of order the virial temperature or <~10^5 K.

The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM.

The graphene forms due to preferential sublimation of Si\nfrom the surface. In vacuum, this sublimation occurs much more rapidly for the\nC-face than the Si-face, so that 150 C lower annealing temperatures are\nrequired for the C-face to obtain films of comparable thickness. The evolution\nof the morphology as a function of graphene thickness is examined, revealing\nsignificant differences between the C-face and the Si-face. For annealing near\n1320 C, graphene films of about 2 monolayers (ML) thickness are formed on the\nSi-face, but 16 ML is found for the C-face. In both cases, step bunches are\nformed on the surface. For the Si-face, layer-by-layer growth of the graphene\nis observed in areas between the step bunches. At 1170 C, for the C-face, a\nmore 3-dimensional type of growth is found. The average thickness is then about\n4 ML, but with a wide variation in local thickness (2 - 7 ML) over the surface.\nThe spatial arrangement of constant-thickness domains are found to be\ncorrelated with step bunches on the surface, which form in a more restricted\nmanner than at 1320 C.

As motivation, we note that Linde's simple\nchaotic inflation $V=(1/2)m^{2}\\phi^{2}$ produces values of $n_{s}=0.967$ and\n$r=0.13$, which are consistent with the WMAP 1-sigma error bars.

Our numerical results from exact and self-consistent solution of\nthe equations of motion for $\\phi_2$ and the Friedmann equations support this\nformula, and it should hold for any slow-roll dark energy.\n  Our potential can be easily realized in N-flation models with many fields,\nand is easily falsifiable by upcoming experiments -- for example, if Linde's\nchaotic inflation is ruled out.

Radio observations of \"extreme scattering events\" and \"parabolic arcs\"\nand microwave observations of \"cold dust cirrus\" clouds are observed at 15 - 20\nK temperatures are till now not considered in a unifying picture. Aims: The\ntheory of gravitational hydrodynamics predicts galactic dark matter arises from\nJeans clusters that are made up of almost a trillion micro brown dwarfs (mBDs)\nof earth weight. It is intended to explain the aforementioned anomalous\nobservations and to make predictions within this framework. Methods: We employ\nanalytical isothermal modeling to estimate various effects.

The \"dust\" temperature of cold galaxy halos arises from\na thermostat setting due to a slow release of latent heat at the 14 K gas to\nsolid transition at the mBD surface.

Transmission electron\nmicroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism\nand magnetization measurements show that nanoparticles synthesized by thermal\ndecomposition display high crystal quality and bulk-like magnetic and\nelectronic properties, while nanoparticles synthesized by co-precipitation show\nmuch poorer crystallinity and particle-like phenomenology, including reduced\nmagnetization, high closure fields and shifted hysteresis loops. The key role\nof the crystal quality is thus suggested since particle-like behavior for\nparticles larger than about 5 nm is only observed when they are structurally\ndefective. These conclusions are supported by Monte Carlo simulations. It is\nalso shown that thermal decomposition is capable of producing nanoparticles\nthat, after further stabilization in physiological conditions, are suitable for\nbiomedical applications such as magnetic resonance imaging or bio-distribution\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 06:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}

In this study, we investigate the\nstatistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura\nstriata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable sequences, we first\nshow that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese\nfinch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one\nprevious syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential\nbehaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that\nhigher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden\nstate transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds\nto hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large\nrange of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these\nmodels with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual\nannotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and\nsurpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does\nnot use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical\nrepresentation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural\nimplementation for generating complex sequences with higher-order dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 06:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

At\nlow mass accretion rates, evaporation dominates and can completely remove the\ninner disk. At higher mass accretion rates, condensation becomes more efficient\nin the very inner regions, so that part of the mass accretes via a weak\n(initially formed) inner disk which is separated from the outer disk by a fully\nevaporated region at mid radii. At still higher mass accretion rates,\ncondensation dominates everywhere, so there is a continuous cool disk extending\nto the innermost stable circular orbit. We extend these calculations by\nincluding the effect of irradiation by the hot corona on the disk structure.\nThe flux which is not reflected is reprocessed in the disk, adding to the\nintrinsic thermal emission from gravitational energy release. This increases\nthe seed photons for Compton cooling of the hot corona, enhancing condensation\nof the hot flow and re-inforcing the residual inner disk rather than\nevaporating it. Our calculations confirm that a residual inner disk can\nco-exist with a hard, coronally dominated, spectrum over a range of $0.006<\\dot\nm<0.016$ (for $\\alpha=0.2$).

Recently, Dasgupta, Kumar, and\nSarlos (STOC 2010) constructed such a transform that uses a sparse matrix. This\nis motivated by the desire to speed up the computation when applied to sparse\ninput vectors, a scenario that comes up in applications. The sparsity of their\nconstruction was further improved by Kane and Nelson (ArXiv 2010).\n  We improve the previous bound on the number of non-zero entries per column of\nKane and Nelson from $O(1/\\epsilon \\log(1/\\delta)\\log(k/\\delta))$ (where the\ntarget dimension is $k$, the distortion is $1\\pm \\epsilon$, and the failure\nprobability is $\\delta$) to $$ O\\left({1\\over\\epsilon}\n\\left({\\log(1/\\delta)\\log\\log\\log(1/\\delta) \\over\n\\log\\log(1/\\delta)}\\right)^2\\right). $$\n  We also improve the amount of randomness needed to generate the matrix.

We report on a detailed study of the optical afterglow of GRB 061121\nwith our original time-series photometric data. In conjunction with X-ray\nobservations, we discuss the origin of its optical and X-ray afterglows.\nMethods. We observed the optical afterglow of Swift burst GRB 061121 with the\nKanata 1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory. Our observation covers\na period just after an X-ray plateau phase. We also performed deep imaging with\nthe Subaru telescope in 2010 in order to estimate the contamination of the host\ngalaxy. Results. In the light curve, we find that the optical afterglow also\nexhibited a break as in the X-ray afterglow. However, our observation suggests\na possible hump structure or a flattening period before the optical break in\nthe light curve. There is no sign of such a hump in the X-ray light curve.\nConclusions. This implies that the emitting region of optical was distinct from\nthat of X-rays. The hump in the optical light curve was possibly caused by the\npassage of the typical frequency of synchrotron emission from another forward\nshock distinct from the early afterglow. The observed decay and spectral\nindices are inconsistent with the standard synchrotron-shock model. Hence, the\nobservation requires a change in microphysical parameters in the shock region\nor a prior activity of the central engine. Alternatively, the emission during\nthe shallow decay phase may be a composition of two forward shock emissions, as\nindicated by the hump structure in the light curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 11:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We investigate the\ninfluence of cooling of the background plasma on the properties of\nmagneto-acoustic waves.

Assuming that the BBH has a circular orbit and that the jet\naxis is parallel to the binary angular momentum, our observational results\ndemonstrate the presence of a very close BBH that has the binary orbit with an\norbital period of $1.05\\pm0.03$ years, an orbital radius of $(3.9\\pm1.0) \\times\n10^{-3}$ pc, an orbital separation of $(6.1^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) \\times 10^{-3}$ pc,\nthe larger black hole mass of $(1.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2}) \\times 10^9$ $M_{\\sun}$, and\nthe smaller black hole mass of $(7.0^{+4.7}_{-6.4}) \\times 10^8$ $M_{\\sun}$.\nThe BBH decay time of $(5.1^{+60.5}_{-2.5})\\times 10^2$ years provides evidence\nfor the occurrence of black hole mergers.

By using the non-equilibrium Green function\ncombining with the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the Nernst and Seebeck\ncoefficients are obtained. Due to the electron-hole symmetry, the Nernst\ncoefficient is an even function of the Fermi energy while the Seebeck\ncoefficient is an odd function regardless of the magnetic field. In the\npresence of a strong magnetic field, the Nernst and Seebeck coefficients are\nalmost independent of the chirality and width of the nanoribbon, and they show\npeaks when the Fermi energy crosses the Landau levels. The height of $n$-th\n(excluding $n=0$) peak is $[\\ln2/|n|]$ for the Nernst effect and is $\\ln2/n$\nfor the Seebeck effect. For the zeroth peak, it is abnormal with height\n$[2\\ln2]$ for the Nernst effect and the peak disappears for the Seebeck effect.\nWhen the magnetic field is turned off, however, the Nernst effect is absent and\nonly Seebeck effect exists. In this case, the Seebeck coefficient strongly\ndepends on the chirality of the nanoribbon. The peaks are equidistant for the\nnanoribbons with zigzag edge but are irregularly distributed for the armchair\nedge. In particular, for the insulating armchair ribbon, the Seebeck\ncoefficient can be very large near the Dirac point. When the magnetic field\nvaries from zero to large values, the differences among the Seebeck\ncoefficients for different chiral ribbons gradually vanish and the nonzero\nvalue of Nernst coefficient appears first near the Dirac point then gradually\nextents to the whole energy region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 14:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We constrain the\nproperties of the magnetic field of HD 46375 based on spectropolarimetric\nobservations with the NARVAL spectrograph at the Pic du Midi observatory. In\naddition, we use a high-resolution NARVAL flux spectrum to contrain the\natmospheric parameters.

We consider a `space-time'\nrandom-cluster model and explore a range of useful probabilistic techniques for\nstudying it. The space-time Potts model emerges as a natural generalization of\nthe quantum Ising model. The basic properties of the phase transitions in these\nmodels are treated, such as the fact that there is at most one unbounded\nFK-cluster, and the resulting lower bound on the critical value in $\\ZZ$.

We address these issues by using the random-parity representation to\nestablish certain differential inequalities, integration of which give the\nresults.

Stable\nmagnetic field configurations are known which could persist probably for the\nentire main-sequence life of the star, but they may not show the complexity and\ndiversity exhibited by the Ap stars observed. We suggest that the Ap star\nmagnetism is not a result of stable configurations, but is the result of an\ninstability based on strong toroidal magnetic fields buried in the stars. The\nhighly nonaxisymmetric remainders of the instability are reminiscent of the\ndiversity of fields seen on Ap stars. The strengths of these remnant magnetic\nfields is actually between a few per cent up to considerable fractions of the\ninternal toroidal field; this means field strengths of the order of kGauss\nbeing compatible with what is observed. The magnetic fields emerge at the\nsurface rather quickly; rough estimates deliver time-scales of the order of a\nfew years. Since rotation stabilizes the instability, normal A stars may still\nhost considerable, invisible toroidal magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 15:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

HD 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting Saturn-mass\nexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. It was observed by the CoRoT satellite for\n34 days during the fall of 2008. We attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,\nthe changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. We then try to improve\nthe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and the\nuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. The data analysis relies\non the Fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. We find evidence of\na sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with light\nreflected by the planet. Its relative amplitude is Delta Fp/F* = [13.0, 26.8]\nppm, implying an albedo A=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightness\ntemperature Tb ~ [1880,2030] K by assuming a radius R=1.1 R_Jup and an\ninclination i=45 deg. Its orbital phase differs from that of the\nradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_RV. However, the tiny planetary\nsignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluric\nsignal with a 1 day period. We show that this signal is suppressed, but not\neliminated, when using the time series for HD 46179 from the same CoRoT run as\na reference. This detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planet\nshould be confirmable with a longer CoRoT observation of the same field. In any\ncase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized using\nultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by CoRoT\nand Kepler. The combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the same\ntargets (Gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetary\nscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such as\nPlato.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 15:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-12"}
