The present paper is devoted to the\ncase of genus 2, to the investigation of algebraic two-valued group structures\non Kummer varieties.\n  One of our approaches is based on the theory of $\\sigma$-functions. It\nenables us to study the dependence of parameters of the curves, including\nrational limits. Following this line, we are introducing a notion of\n$n$-groupoid as natural multivalued analogue of the notion of topological\ngroupoid.\n  Our second approach is geometric. It is based on a geometric approach to\naddition laws on hyperelliptic Jacobians and on a recent notion of billiard\nalgebra. Especially important is connection with integrable billiard systems\nwithin confocal quadrics.\n  The third approach is based on the realization of the Kummer variety in the\nframework of moduli of semi-stable bundles, after Narasimhan and Ramanan. This\nconstruction of the two-valued structure is remarkably similar to the\nhistorically first example of topological formal two-valued group from 1971,\nwith a significant difference: the resulting bundles in the 1971 case were\n\"virtual\", while in the present case the resulting bundles are effectively\nrealizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-12"}

For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole\nat the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the\nimmediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. (2009) have already shown\nthat by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion\ntheory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black\nhole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes.\nHere we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a\nclass of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models.

Until\nrecently relativistic supernovae have been discovered only through their\nassociation with long duration Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB). The blastwaves of such\nexplosions are well described by the Blandford-McKee (in the ultra relativistic\nregime) and Sedov-Taylor (in the non-relativistic regime) solutions during\ntheir afterglows, as the ejecta mass is negligible in comparison to the swept\nup mass. The recent discovery of the relativistic supernova SN 2009bb, without\na detected GRB, opens up the possibility of highly baryon loaded mildly\nrelativistic outflows which remains in nearly free expansion phase during the\nradio afterglow. In this work, we consider a massive, relativistic shell,\nlaunched by a Central Engine Driven EXplosion (CEDEX), decelerating\nadiabatically due to its collision with the pre-explosion circumstellar wind\nprofile of the progenitor. We compute the synchrotron emission from\nrelativistic electrons in the shock amplified magnetic field. This models the\nradio emission from the circumstellar interaction of a CEDEX. We show that this\nmodel explains the observed radio evolution of the prototypical SN 2009bb and\ndemonstrate that SN 2009bb had a highly baryon loaded, mildly relativistic\noutflow. We discuss the effect of baryon loading on the dynamics and\nobservational manifestations of a CEDEX.

This discrimination is performed by inputting one-mode or\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states with fixed total energy. By optimizing over\nthis class of states, we find that the optimal inputs are pure, thus\ncorresponding to single- and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In particular, we\nshow that for any value of the damping rate smaller than a critical value there\nis a threshold on the energy that makes the two-mode squeezed vacuum state more\nconvenient than the corresponding single-mode state, whereas for damping larger\nthan this critical value two-mode squeezed vacua are always better. We then\nconsider the discrimination in realistic conditions, where it is unlikely to\nhave pure squeezing. Thus by fixing both input energy and squeezing, we show\nthat two-mode squeezed thermal states are always better than their single- mode\ncounterpart when all the thermal photons are directed into the dissipative\nchannel. Besides, this result also holds approximately for unbalanced\ndistribution of the thermal photons. Finally, we also investigate the role of\ncorrelations in the improvement of detection. For fixed input squeezing\n(single-mode or two-mode), we find that the reduction of the quantum Chernoff\nbound is a monotone function of the two-mode entanglement as well as the\nquantum mutual information and the quantum discord.

Considering the PNJ with the\nsharp interface, in a armchair ribbon, the electron flow emitting from $(-L,0)$\nin n-region can always be focused perfectly at $(L,0)$ in p-region in the whole\nDirac fermion regime, i.e. in whole regime $E_0<t$ where $E_0$ is the distance\nbetween Dirac-point energy and Fermi energy and $t$ is the nearest hopping\nenergy. For the bipolar ribbon with zigzag edge, however, the incoming electron\nflow in n-region is perfectly converged in p-region only in a very low energy\nregime with $E_0<0.05t$. Moreover, for a smooth PNJ, electrons are\nbackscattered near PNJ, which weakens the focusing effect. But the focusing\npattern still remains the same as that of the sharp PNJ. In addition, quantum\noscillation in charge density occurs due to the interference between forward\nand backward scattering. Finally, in the presence of weak perpendicular\nmagnetic field, charge carriers are deflected in opposite directions in the\np-region and n-region. As a result, the focusing effect is smeared. The lower\nenergy $E_0$, the easier the focusing effect is destroyed. For the high energy\n$E_0$ (e.g. $E_0=0.9t$), however, the focusing effect can still survive in a\nmoderate magnetic field on order of one Tesla.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 04:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Living systems, known as complex systems,\nrequire complexity in interactions among molecules, cells, organs, and\nindividuals or regulatory mechanisms to perform a variety of activities for\nsurvival. On this basis, aging can be understood in terms of a progressive loss\nof complexity with age; this suggests that complexity in living systems would\nevolve with age. In general, aging dynamics is mathematically depicted by a\nsurvival function, which monotonically changes from 1 to 0 with age. It would\nbe then useful to find an adequate survival function to link aging dynamics and\ncomplexity evolution. Here we describe a flexible survival function, which is\nderived from the stretched exponential function by adopting an age-dependent\nexponent. We note that the exponent is associated with evolving complexity,\ni.e., a fractal-like scaling in cumulative mortality. The survival function\nwell depicts a general feature in survival curves; healthy populations show a\ntendency to evolve towards rectangular-like survival curves, as examples in\nhumans or laboratory animals. This tendency suggests that both aging and\ncomplexity would evolve towards healthy survival in living systems. Our\nfunction to link aging with complexity may contribute to better understanding\nof biological aging in terms of complexity evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 05:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-15"}

We simulate competing\ncosmological models which have identical expansion histories - one is a\nquintessence dark energy model with a scalar field and the other is a modified\ngravity model with a time varying gravitational constant - and demonstrate that\nthey do indeed produce different redshift space distortions.

The scatter in the SFI++ RL\nrelation is 2.5-4 times smaller than previously reported for various samples,\nwhich we attribute to the reliability of isophotal radii relative to disk\nscale-lengths. After carefully accounting for all measurement errors, our\nscaling relation error budgets are consistent with a constant intrinsic scatter\nin the LV and RV relations for velocity widths logW>2.4, with evidence for\nincreasing intrinsic scatter below this threshold. The scatter in the RL\nrelation is consistent with constant intrinsic scatter that is biased by\nincompleteness at the low-luminosity end. Possible applications of the\nunprecedentedly tight SFI++ RV and RL relations are investigated. Just like the\nTully-Fisher relation, the RV relation can be used as a distance indicator: we\nderive distances to galaxies with primary Cepheid distances that are accurate\nto 25%, and reverse the problem to measure a Hubble constant H_0=72+/-7\nkm/s/Mpc. Combining the small intrinsic scatter of our RL relation\n(0.034+/-0.001 log(kpc/h)) with a simple model for disk galaxy formation, we\nfind an upper limit on the range of disk spin parameters that is a factor of ~7\nsmaller than that of the halo spin parameters predicted by cosmological\nsimulations.

Simultaneous source mask\noptimization (SMO) has become an important objective in the field of\ncomputational lithography. SMO is considered essential to extending immersion\nlithography beyond the 45nm node. However, SMO is computationally extremely\nchallenging and time-consuming. The key challenges are due to run time vs.\naccuracy tradeoffs of the imaging models used for the computational\nlithography. We present a new technique to be incorporated in the SMO flow.\nThis new approach is based on the reduced basis method (RBM) applied to the\nsimulation of light transmission through the lithography masks. It provides a\nrigorous approximation to the exact lithographical problem, based on fully\nvectorial Maxwell's equations. Using the reduced basis method, the optimization\nprocess is divided into an offline and an online steps. In the offline step, a\nRBM model with variable geometrical parameters is built self-adaptively and\nusing a Finite Element (FEM) based solver. In the online step, the RBM model\ncan be solved very fast for arbitrary illumination and geometrical parameters,\nsuch as dimensions of OPC features, line widths, etc. This approach\ndramatically reduces computational costs of the optimization procedure while\nproviding accuracy superior to the approaches involving simplified mask models.\nRBM furthermore provides rigorous error estimators, which assure the quality\nand reliability of the reduced basis solutions.

The rolling problem $(NS)$ corresponds to the situation\nwhere there is no relative spin (or twist) of one manifold with respect to the\nother one. As for the rolling problem $(R)$, there is no relative spin and also\nno relative slip. Since the manifolds are not assumed to be embedded into an\nEuclidean space, we provide an intrinsic description of the two constraints\n\"without spinning\" and \"without slipping\" in terms of the Levi-Civita\nconnections $\\nabla^{g}$ and $\\nabla^{\\hg}$. For that purpose, we recast the\ntwo rolling problems within the framework of geometric control and associate to\neach of them a distribution and a control system. We then investigate the\nrelationships between the two control systems and we address for both of them\nthe issue of complete controllability. For the rolling $(NS)$, the reachable\nset (from any point) can be described exactly in terms of the holonomy groups\nof $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ respectively, and thus we achieve a complete\nunderstanding of the controllability properties of the corresponding control\nsystem. As for the rolling $(R)$, the problem turns out to be more delicate. We\nfirst provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the\nassociated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played\nby a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the\n\\emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space\nform (let say $(\\hM,\\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of\n$(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which\npreserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce\nthat the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy\ngroup of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove\nthat the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the\nholonomy group of a connection on $TM\\oplus \\R$, that we call the rolling\nconnection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if\nthe rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian\ncovering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of\n$\\R^{n+1}$. When the two manifolds are three-dimensional, we provide a complete\nlocal characterization of the reachable sets when the two manifolds are\nthree-dimensional and, in particular, we identify necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of a non open orbit. Besides the trivial case\nwhere the manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$ are (locally) isometric, we show\nthat (local) non controllability occurs if and only if $(M,g)$ and $(\\hM,\\hg)$\nare either warped products or contact manifolds with additional restrictions\nthat we precisely describe. Finally, we extend the two types of rolling to the\ncase where the manifolds have different dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 14:45:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2011 11:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

Moreover, high speed\nimaging enables us to show how the back-and-forth motion of flagella at very\nshort times affects the statistical description of the dynamics. Finally we\nshow how drag forces modify the characteristics of this particular random walk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 14:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 14:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-17"}

The size of each cluster is maintained\nhigher than $m$ nodes ($m$ is a parameter of the algorithm).
