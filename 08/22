Contemporary VHO decision algorithms are based\non generic QoS metrics viz. SNR, bandwidth, jitter, BER and delay. In this\npaper, Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is proposed to be a generic QoS trigger for\nVHO execution. EVM is defined as the deviation of inphase/ quadrature (I/Q)\nvalues from ideal signal states and thus provides a measure of signal quality.\nIn 4G Interoperable environment, OFDM is the leading Modulation scheme (more\nprone to multi-path fading). EVM (modulation error) properly characterises the\nwireless link/ channel for accurate VHO decision. EVM depends on the inherent\ntransmission impairments viz. frequency offset, phase noise,\nnon-linear-impairment, skewness etc. for a given wireless link.

Approximate values of the probabilities of fatality are used\nto calculate the Gibb's entropy, which is more accurate than the P-B entropy\nfar from equilibrium, and are shown to be again proportional to ISS.

This is a variant of the majority-vote model in which the\nindividual retains its opinion in case there is a tie among the neighbors'\nopinions.

We compute a\nnonlinear dispersion relation and show that the $x/t$ plane splits into $g+1$\nsoliton regions which are interlaced by $g+1$ oscillatory regions, where $g+1$\nis the number of spectral gaps.\n  In the soliton regions the solution is asymptotically given by a number of\nsolitons travelling on top of finite-gap solutions which are in the same\nisospectral class as the background solution. In the oscillatory region the\nsolution can be described by a modulated finite-gap solution plus a decaying\ndispersive tail. The modulation is given by phase transition on the isospectral\ntorus and is, together with the dispersive tail, explicitly characterized in\nterms of Abelian integrals on the underlying hyperelliptic curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 13:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 20:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

Due to sequential nature, parallel implementation of these\nalgorithms usually leads to miss of efficiency; e.g. a significant convergence\nrate decay. Therefore, there is an interest to parallelize sequential sweeping\nprocedures, keeping the efficiency of the original method simultaneously. This\npaper goals to parallelize sequential sweeping algorithms on structured grids,\nwith emphasis on SOR and ILU preconditioners. The presented method can be\naccounted as an overlapping domain decomposition method combined to a\nmulti-frontal sweeping procedure. The implementation of method in one and two\ndimensions are discussed in details. The extension to higher dimensions and\ngeneral structured n-diagonal matrices is outlined. Introducing notion of\nalternatively block upper-lower triangular matrices, the convergence theory is\nestablished in general cases. Numerical results on model problems show that,\nunlike related alternative parallel methods, the convergence rate and\nefficiency of the presented method is close to the original sequential method.\nNumerical results also support successful use of the presented method as a\ncache efficient solver in sequential computations as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 13:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

EMD can be used to estimate\na signal's instantaneous frequency (IF) but suffers from poor performance in\nthe presence of noise. To produce a meaningful IF, each mode of the\ndecomposition must be nearly monochromatic, a condition that is not guaranteed\nby the algorithm and fails to be met when the signal is corrupted by noise. In\nthis work, the extraction of modes containing both signal and noise is\nidentified as the cause of poor IF estimation. The specific mechanism by which\nsuch \"transition\" modes are extracted is detailed and builds on the observation\nof Flandrin and Goncalves that EMD acts in a filter bank manner when analyzing\npure noise. The mechanism is shown to be dependent on spectral leak between\nmodes and the phase of the underlying signal. These ideas are developed through\nthe use of simple signals and are tested on a synthetic seismic waveform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 00:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-26"}

In this heuristic, $N$\nagents, characterized by binary strings of length $F$ which represent possible\nsolutions to the optimization problem, are fixed at the sites of a square\nlattice and interact with their nearest neighbors only. The interactions are\nsuch that the agents' strings (or cultures) become more similar to the low-cost\nstrings of their neighbors resulting in the dissemination of these strings\nacross the lattice. Eventually the dynamics freezes into a homogeneous\nabsorbing configuration in which all agents exhibit identical solutions to the\noptimization problem. We find through extensive simulations that the\nprobability of finding the optimal solution is a function of the reduced\nvariable $F/N^{1/4}$ so that the number of agents must increase with the fourth\npower of the problem size, $N \\propto F^ 4$, to guarantee a fixed probability\nof success. In this case, we find that the relaxation time to reach an\nabsorbing configuration scales with $F^ 6$ which can be interpreted as the\noverall computational cost of the ACH to find an optimal set of weights for a\nBoolean Binary Perceptron, given a fixed probability of success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 13:05:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 19:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}
