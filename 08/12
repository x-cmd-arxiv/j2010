Spikes are emitted when the membrane potential blows up or reaches\na cutoff value. The precise simulation of the spike times and of the adaptation\nvariable is critical for it governs the spike pattern produced, and is hard to\ncompute accurately because of the exploding nature of the system at the spike\ntimes. We thoroughly study the precision of fixed time-step integration schemes\nfor this type of models and demonstrate that these methods produce systematic\nerrors that are unbounded, as the cutoff value is increased, in the evaluation\nof the two crucial quantities: the spike time and the value of the adaptation\nvariable at this time.

Dynamical decoupling (DD) is\none of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,\nespecially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment\n(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is\na reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,\nthe environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the\nsystem-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between\nrefocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of\nthe environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the\nspacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of\ndifferent DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C\nnuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the\nenvironment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.\nStrong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly\nfluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our\nexperimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better\nperformance if they are compared with the bath correlation time.

Here we suggest\nusing gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to test such a marriage of\nneutrino HDM and modified gravity, adopting the framework of\ntensor-vector-scalar theory (TeVeS). Unlike conventional cold dark matter\n(CDM), such HDM is subject to strong phase-space constraints, which allows one\nto check cluster lens models inferred within the modified framework for\nconsistency. Since the considered HDM particles cannot collapse into\narbitrarily dense clumps and only form structures well above the galactic\nscale, systems which indicate the need for dark substructure are of particular\ninterest. As a first example, we study the cluster lens Abell 2390 and its\nimpressive straight arc with the help of numerical simulations. Based on our\nresults, we outline a general and systematic approach to model cluster lenses\nin TeVeS which significantly reduces the calculation complexity. We further\nconsider a simple bimodal lens configuration, capable of producing the straight\narc, to demonstrate our approach.

We have reasons to believe that powerful gamma-ray\nflat spectrum radio sources emit most of their radiation where radiative\ncooling is severe. This helps to find the minimum number of emitting leptons\nneeded to explain the radiation we see. The number of protons is more\nuncertain. If there is one proton per electron, they dominate the jet power,\nbut they could be unimportant if the emission is due to electron-positron\npairs. In this case the total jet power could be much smaller. However, if the\ngamma-ray flux is due to inverse Compton scattering with seed photons produced\noutside the jet, the radiation is anisotropic also in the comoving frame,\nmaking the jet to recoil. This Compton rocket effect is strong for light,\nelectron-positron jets, and negligible for heavy, proton dominated jets.

In the absence of subsequent accretion, it will be\ndepleted from the photosphere. We now extend diffusive nuclear burning to He,\nmotivated by the recent observation by Ho \\& Heinke of a carbon atmosphere on\nthe NS in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. We calculate the equilibrium\nstructure of He on an underlying $\\alpha$ capturing material, accounting for\nthermal, mass defect, and Coulomb corrections on the stratification of material\nwith the same zeroth order $\\mu_e = A/Z$. We show that Coulomb corrections\ndominate over thermal and mass defect corrections in the highly degenerate part\nof the envelope. We also show that the bulk of the He sits deep in the envelope\nrather than near the surface. Thus, even if the photospheric He abundance is\nlow, the total He column could be substantially larger than the photospheric\ncolumn, which may have implications for rapid surface evolution ($\\approx 1$ yr\ntimescales) of neutron stars. When nuclear reactions are taken into account, we\nfind that for base temperatures $\\gtrsim 1.6 \\times 10^8$ K, He is readily\ncaptured onto C. As these high temperatures are present during the early stages\nof NS evolution, we expect that the primordial He is completely depleted from\nthe NS surface like the case for primordial H.

Armed with the\nresults of this work and our prior efforts, we expect that primordial H and He\nare depleted, and so any observed H or He on the surfaces of these NS must be\ndue to subsequent accretion (with or without spallation).

We interpret the observed SEDs of 16 ULIRGs using\nthis physically-motivated model which accounts for the emission of stellar\npopulations from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and for the attenuation\nby dust in two components: an optically-thick starburst component and the\ndiffuse ISM. The infrared emission is computed by assuming that all the energy\nabsorbed by dust in these components is re-radiated at mid- and far-infrared\nwavelengths. This model allows us to derive statistically physical properties\nincluding star formation rates, stellar masses, as well as temperatures and\nmasses of different dust components and plausible star formation histories. We\nfind that, although the ultraviolet to near-infrared emission represents only a\nsmall fraction of the total power radiated by ULIRGs, observations in this\nwavelength range are important to understand the properties of the stellar\npopulations and dust attenuation in the diffuse ISM of these galaxies.\nFurthermore, our analysis indicates that the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy\nfrom the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope is crucial to\nobtain realistic estimates of the extinction to the central energy source,\nmainly via the depth of the 9.7-micron silicate feature, and thus accurately\nconstrain the total energy balance.

We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize\nthe third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left\ntime unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as\nInfluence Maximization.\n  In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally\nmotivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the\nfirst problem, termed Minimum Target Set Selection (or MINTSS for short), a\ncoverage threshold n is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set\nsuch that by activating it, at least n nodes are eventually activated in the\nexpected sense. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, a coverage threshold n\nand a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size\nat most k such that by activating it, at least n nodes are activated, in the\nminimum possible time. Both these problems are NP-hard, which motivates our\ninterest in their approximation.\n  For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a\nbicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result\nsuggesting that improving it is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that\neven bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several\nconditions. However, if we allow the budget to be boosted by a logarithmic\nfactor and allow the coverage to fall short, then the problem can be solved\nexactly in PTIME.\n  Finally, we show the value of the approximation algorithms, by comparing them\nagainst various heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 20:35:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 11:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 23:29:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2011 04:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-08"}

Here we\nstudy the trajectories and observability of MBHs recoiling in three (one major,\ntwo minor) gas-rich galaxy merger remnants that were previously simulated at\nhigh resolution, and in which the pairing of the MBHs had been shown to be\nsuccessful. We run new simulations of MBHs recoiling in the major merger\nremnant with Mach numbers in the range 1<M<6, and use simulation data to\nconstruct a semi-analytical model for the orbital evolution of MBHs in gas-rich\nsystems. We show that: 1) in major merger remnants the energy deposited by the\nmoving hole into the rotationally supported, turbulent medium makes a\nnegligible contribution to the thermodynamics of the gas. This contribution\nbecomes significant in minor merger remnants, potentially allowing for an\nelectromagnetic signature of MBH recoil; 2) in major merger remnants, the\ncombination of both deeper central potential well and drag from high-density\ngas confines even MBHs with kick velocities as high as 1200 km/s within 1 kpc\nfrom the host's center; 3) kinematically offset nuclei may be observable for\ntimescales of a few Myr in major merger remnants in the case of recoil\nvelocities in the range 700-1,000 km/s; 4) in minor mergers remnants the effect\nof gas drag is weaker, and MBHs with recoil speeds in the range 300-600 km/s\nwill wander through the host halo for longer timescales.

It is the goal of\nthis paper to develop a fast GPU-based algorithm to reconstruct high quality\nCBCT images from undersampled and noisy projection data so as to lower the\nimaging dose. For this purpose, we have developed an iterative tight frame (TF)\nbased CBCT reconstruction algorithm. A condition that a real CBCT image has a\nsparse representation under a TF basis is imposed in the iteration process as\nregularization to the solution. To speed up the computation, a multi-grid\nmethod is employed. Our GPU implementation has achieved high computational\nefficiency and a CBCT image of resolution 512\\times512\\times70 can be\nreconstructed in ~5 min. We have tested our algorithm on a digital NCAT phantom\nand a physical Catphan phantom. It is found that our TF-based algorithm is able\nto reconstrct CBCT in the context of undersampling and low mAs levels. We have\nalso quantitatively analyzed the reconstructed CBCT image quality in terms of\nmodulation-transfer-function and contrast-to-noise ratio under various scanning\nconditions. The results confirm the high CBCT image quality obtained from our\nTF algorithm. Moreover, our algorithm has also been validated in a real\nclinical context using a head-and-neck patient case.

We consider the normal mode stability analysis\nof two kinds of radial profiles of the mean potential vorticity: The first type\nis a single step and the second kind is a symmetrical step of finite width\ndescribing either a localized depression or peak of the mean potential\nvorticity. For single potential vorticity steps we find there is no\ninstability. There is no instability when the symmetric step is a localized\npeak. However, the Rossby wave instability occurs when the symmetrical step\nprofile is a depression, which, in turn, corresponds to localized peaks in the\nmean enthalpy profile. This is in qualitative agreement with previous\ntwo-dimensional investigations of the instability. For all potential vorticity\ndepressions, instability occurs for regions narrower than some maximum radial\nlength scale. We interpret the instability as resulting from the interaction of\nat least two Rossby edgewaves.

Space-time\ndiagrams are introduced, which characterize this localization and illustrate\nthe coherence issues of neutrino oscillations. We discuss two approaches to\ncalculations of the transition amplitudes, which allow different physics\ninterpretations: (i) using configuration-space wave packets for the involved\nparticles, which leads to approximate conservation laws for their mean energies\nand momenta; (ii) calculating first a plane-wave amplitude of the process,\nwhich exhibits exact energy-momentum conservation, and then convoluting it with\nthe momentum-space wave packets of the involved particles.

We demonstrate that the\ncontribution of the recoil particle to the oscillation phase is negligible\nprovided that the coherence conditions for neutrino production and detection\nare satisfied.

The following\nfeatures are found for all five liquids: 1) Each liquid has an \"internal\nclock\", a fact that is established by showing that the aging of the structure\nis controlled by the same material time that controls the dielectric\nproperties. 2) There are no so-called expansion gaps between the long-time\nlimits of the relaxation rates following up and down jumps to the same\ntemperature. 3) At long times the structural relaxation is not stretched, but a\nsimple exponential decay. 4) For small temperature steps the rate of the\nlong-time exponential structural relaxation is identical to that of the\nlong-time decay of the dipole autocorrelation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 09:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

The CO/13CO 1-0\nline intensity ratio can be used as a tracer of how dynamics and star formation\nprocesses impact the gas properties. The Medusa (NGC~4194) merger is\nparticularly interesting to study since its LFIR/LCO ratio rivals that of\nultraluminous galaxies (ULIRGs), despite the comparatively modest luminosity,\nindicating an exceptionally high star formation efficiency (SFE) in the Medusa\nmerger.\n  Interferometric OVRO observations of CO and 13CO 1-0 in the Medusa show the\nCO/13CO intensity ratio increases from normal, quiescent values (7-10) in the\nouter parts (r>2 kpc) of the galaxy to high (16 to >40) values in the central\n(r<1 kpc) starburst region. In the centre there is an east-west gradient where\nthe line ratio changes by more than a factor of three over 5\" (945 pc). The\nintegrated 13CO emission peaks in the north-western starburst region while the\ncentral CO emission is strongly associated with the prominent crossing\ndust-lane.

We suggest that the\ncentral gradient is mainly caused by diffuse gas in the dust lane. In this\nscenario, the actual molecular mass distribution is better traced by the 13CO\n1-0 emission than the CO. The possibilities of temperature and abundance\ngradients are also discussed.

We re-assess the origin\nof CO in Hale-Bopp's coma from millimeter interferometric data and a\nre-analysis of the IR lines.\n  Simultaneous observations of the CO J(1-0) (115 GHz) and J(2-1) (230 GHz)\nlines were undertaken with the IRAM interferometer in single-dish and\ninterferometric modes. The diversity of angular resolutions (from 1700 to 42000\nkm diameter at the comet) is suitable to study the radial distribution of CO\nand detect the extended source observed in the infrared. We used excitation and\nradiative transfer models to simulate the observations. Various CO density\ndistributions were considered, including 3D time-dependent hydrodynamical\nsimulations which reproduce a CO rotating jet. The CO J(1-0) and J(2-1)\nobservations can be consistently explained by a nuclear production of CO.\nComposite 50:50 nuclear/extended productions with characteristic scale lengths\nof CO parent L_p > 1500 km are rejected.\n  Based on similar radiation transfer calculations, we show that the CO v = 1-0\nro-vibrational lines observed in comet Hale-Bopp at heliocentric distances less\nthan 1.5 AU are severely optically thick. The broad extent of the CO brightness\ndistribution in the infrared is mainly due to optical depth effects. Additional\nfactors can be found in the complex structure of the CO coma, and non-ideal\nslit positioning caused by the anisotropy of dust IR emission.\n  We conclude that both CO millimeter and infrared lines do not provide\ncompelling evidence for a distributed source of CO in Hale-Bopp's atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 11:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We searched for gamma-ray emission from the SMC in order to derive\nconstraints on the CR population and transport in an external system with\nproperties different from the Milky Way. We analysed the first 17 months of\ncontinuous all-sky observations by the Large Area Telescope of the Fermi\nmission to determine the spatial distribution, flux and spectrum of the\ngamma-ray emission from the SMC.

The average density of CR\nelectrons derived from radio synchrotron observations is consistent with the\nsame reduction factor but the uncertainties are large. From our current\nknowledge of the SMC, such a low CR density does not seem to be due to a lower\nrate of CR injection and rather indicates a smaller CR confinement volume\ncharacteristic size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 15:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

However,\nsome studies indicate that the formation of pulsars from the accretion-induced\ncollapse (AIC) of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) cannot be excluded. In this\nwork, we use a population synthesis code to examine if the AIC channel can\nproduce eccentric binary millisecond pulsars (BMSPs) in the Galaxy. Our\nsimulated results indicate that, only when the natal MSPs receive a relatively\nstrong kick ($\\ga100\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$), can the AIC channel produce $\\sim 10-180$\neccentric ($e>0.1$) BMSPs in the Galaxy, most of which are accompanied by a\nHelium star. Such a kick seems to be highly unlikely in the conventional AIC\nprocess, hence the probability of forming eccentric BMSPs via the AIC channel\ncan be ruled out. Even if a high kick is allowed, the AIC channel cannot\nproduce eccentric BMSPs with an orbital period of $\\ga 20$ days. Therefore, we\npropose that the peculiar BMSP PSR J1903+0327 cannot be formed by the AIC\nchannel.

If the pair obeys the cut condition, then the flow-cut gap for this instance\nis the minimum value C such that there is a feasible multiflow for H if each\nedge of G is given capacity C. The flow-cut gap can be greater than 1 even when\nG is the (series-parallel) graph K_{2,3}. In this paper we are primarily\ninterested in the \"integer\" flow-cut gap. What is the minimum value C such that\nthere is a feasible integer valued multiflow for H if each edge of G is given\ncapacity C? We conjecture that the integer flow-cut gap is quantitatively\nrelated to the fractional flow-cut gap. This strengthens the well-known\nconjecture that the flow-cut gap in planar and minor-free graphs is O(1) to\nsuggest that the integer flow-cut gap is O(1). We give several results on\nnon-trivial special classes of graphs supporting this conjecture and further\nexplore the \"primal\" method for understanding flow-cut gaps. Our results\ninclude:\n  - Let G be obtained by series-parallel operations starting from an edge st,\nand consider orienting all edges in G in the direction from s to t. A demand is\ncompliant if its endpoints are joined by a directed path in the resulting\noriented graph. If the cut condition holds for a compliant instance and G+H is\nEulerian, then an integral routing of H exists.\n  - The integer flow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is 5. We also give an\nexplicit class of instances that shows via elementary calculations that the\nflow-cut gap in series-parallel graphs is at least 2-o(1); this simplifies the\nproof by Lee and Raghavendra.\n  - The integer flow-cut gap in k-Outerplanar graphs is c^{O(k)} for some fixed\nconstant c.\n  - A simple proof that the flow-cut gap is O(\\log k^*) where k^* is the size\nof a node-cover in H; this was previously shown by G\\\"unl\\\"uk via a more\nintricate proof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 15:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-16"}

The original quasicontinuum energy (QCE) has been implemented for\nmany-body potentials in two and three space dimensions, but it is not patch\ntest consistent. We propose that by blending the atomistic and corresponding\nCauchy-Born continuum models of QCE in an interfacial region with thickness of\na small number $k$ of blended atoms, a general quasicontinuum energy (BQCE) can\nbe developed with the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of QCE\nnear lattice instabilities such as dislocation formation and motion. In this\npaper, we give an error analysis of the blended quasicontinuum energy (BQCE)\nfor a periodic one-dimensional chain of atoms with next-nearest neighbor\ninteractions.

For such large\nvalues of tan beta the associated production of the heavier Higgses, which is\nenhanced by tan beta squared, becomes three orders of magnitude larger than the\nproduction of a simlar SM-like Higgs and could be observable as one of the\nfirst hints of new physics at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 15:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2010 08:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-27"}

The\ntotal, partial nuclear cross-sections and production rates of alpha\nfragmentation channels in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions and their\ndependence on the mass number and initial energy of the incident projectile\nnucleus are investigated. The yields of multiple alpha fragments emitted from\nthe interactions of projectile nuclei with the nuclei of light, medium and\nheavy target groups of emulsion-detector are discussed and they indicate that\nthe projectile-breakup mechanism seems to be free from the target mass number.\nIt is found that the multiplicity distributions of alpha fragments are well\ndescribed by the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling presentation. The mean\nmultiplicities of the freshly produced newly created charged secondary\nparticles, normally known as shower and secondary particles associated with\ntarget in the events where the emission of alpha fragments were accompanied by\nheavy projectile fragments having Z value larger than 4 seem to be constant as\nthe alpha fragments multiplicity increases, and exhibit a behavior independent\nof the alpha fragments multiplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 15:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-17"}
