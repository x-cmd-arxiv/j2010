We can distinguish four\nregimes according to the different nature of striped domains: a high anisotropy\nIsing regime with sharp domain walls, a saturated stripe regime with thicker\nwalls inside which an in-plane component of the magnetization develops, a\nnarrow canted-like regime, characterized by a sinusoidal variation of both the\nin-plane and the out of plane magnetization components, which upon further\ndecrease of the anisotropy leads to an in-plane ferromagnetic state via a spin\nreorientation transition (SRT).

The form and proposed construction of the control variates is\nderived from our solution of the Poisson equation associated with a specific\nMCMC scenario. The new estimator, which can be applied to the same MCMC sample,\nis derived from a novel, finite-dimensional, explicit representation for the\noptimal coefficients. The resulting variance-reduction methodology is primarily\napplicable when the simulated data are generated by a conjugate random-scan\nGibbs sampler. MCMC examples of Bayesian inference problems demonstrate that\nthe corresponding reduction in the estimation variance is significant, and that\nin some cases it can be quite dramatic.

We also discuss the resource\nallocation problem in the mixed services scenario where certain users have a\nrequired rate, while the others have flexible rate requirements.

We use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of West Nile Virus\nin birds to show that pathogen replication rates decline with host body size,\nbut natural immune system (NIS) response rates do not change systematically\nwith body size. This is surprising since the NIS has to search for small\nquantities of pathogens through larger physical spaces in larger organisms, and\nalso respond by producing larger absolute quantities of antibody in larger\norganisms. We call this scale-invariant detection and response. We hypothesize\nthat the NIS has evolved an architecture to efficiently neutralize pathogens.\nWe investigate a range of architectures using an Agent Based Model (ABM). We\nfind that a sub-modular NIS architecture, in which lymph node number and size\nboth increase sublinearly with body size, efficiently balances the tradeoff\nbetween local pathogen detection and global response using antibodies.

The time evolution of the growth is derived\nfor both cases. At the end of the growth stage the micelle size may be either\nlarger or smaller than its equilibrium value, depending on concentration. A\nfinal stage of equilibration follows, during which the micelles relax to their\nequilibrium size through fission or fusion.
