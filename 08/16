Eta\nCarinae is therefore a primary candidate to search for particle acceleration by\nprobing its gamma-ray emission. We used the first 21 months of Fermi/LAT data\nto extract gamma-ray (0.2-100 GeV) images, spectra and light-curves, then\ncombined them with multi-wavelength observations to model the non-thermal\nspectral energy distribution. A bright gamma-ray source is detected at the\nposition of eta Carinae. Its flux at a few 100 MeV corresponds very well to the\nextrapolation of the hard X-ray spectrum towards higher energies. The spectral\nenergy distribution features two distinct components. The first one extends\nover the keV to GeV energy range, and features an exponential cutoff at ~ 1\nGeV. It can be understood as inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons\nby electrons accelerated up to gamma~1E4 in the colliding wind region. The\nexpected synchrotron emission is compatible with the existing upper limit on\nthe non-thermal radio emission. The second component is a hard gamma-ray tail\ndetected above 20 GeV. It could be explained by pi0-decay of accelerated\nhadrons interacting with the dense stellar wind. The ratio between the fluxes\nof the pi0 and inverse Compton components is roughly as predicted by\nsimulations of colliding wind binaries. This hard gamma-ray tail can only be\nunderstood if emitted close to the wind collision region. The energy\ntransferred to the accelerated particles (~5% of the collision mechanical\nenergy) is comparable to that of the thermal X-ray emission. We have measured\nthe electron spectrum responsible for the keV to GeV emission and detected an\nevidence of hadronic acceleration in eta Carinae. These observations are thus\nin good agreement with the colliding wind scenario suggested for eta Carinae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2010 16:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}

Of the 72 targets which\nremain candidate and confirmed white dwarfs with near-infrared excess, 43 are\nspatially resolved into two or more components, and a total of 12 systems are\npotentially triples. There is a possible, slight deficit of earlier spectral\ntypes (bluer colors) among the spatially unresolved companions, exactly the\nopposite of expectations if significant mass is transferred to the companion\nduring the common envelope phase. Using the best available distance estimates,\nthe low mass companions to white dwarfs exhibit a bimodal distribution in\nprojected separation. This result supports the hypothesis that during the giant\nphases of the white dwarf progenitor, any unevolved companions either migrate\ninward to short periods of hours to days, or outward to periods of hundreds to\nthousands of years. No intermediate projected separations of a few to several\nAU are found among these pairs. However, a few double M dwarfs (within triples)\nare spatially resolved in this range, empirically demonstrating that such\nseparations were readily detectable among the binaries with white dwarfs. A\nstraightforward and testable prediction emerges: all spatially unresolved, low\nmass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs should be in short\nperiod orbits.

De novo assembly not only provides a\ntool for understanding wide scale biological variation, but within human\nbio-medicine, it offers a direct way of observing both large scale structural\nvariation and fine scale sequence variation. Unfortunately, improvements in the\ncomputational feasibility for de novo assembly have not matched the\nimprovements in the gathering of sequence data. This is for two reasons: the\ninherent computational complexity of the problem, and the in-practice memory\nrequirements of tools.\n  Results: In this paper we use entropy compressed or succinct data structures\nto create a practical representation of the de Bruijn assembly graph, which\nrequires at least a factor of 10 less storage than the kinds of structures used\nby deployed methods. In particular we show that when stored succinctly, the de\nBruijn assembly graph for homo sapiens requires only 23 gigabytes of storage.\nMoreover, because our representation is entropy compressed, in the presence of\nsequencing errors it has better scaling behaviour asymptotically than\nconventional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2010 23:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}

In this paper, we propose a mechanism to\nunderstand the origin of the abrupt falloff after plateau by considering\nsolidification of newborn quark stars with latent heat released as energy\ninjection to GRB afterglow. We estimate the total latent heat released during\nthe phase transition of quark stars from liquid to solid states, to be order of\n~ 10^{51}ergs, which is comparable to the emission energy in the shallow decay\nsegment. We also estimate the time scale of radiating the latent heat through\nthermal photon emission, and find that the time scale agrees with observations.\nBased on our estimation, we analyze the process of energy injection to GRB\nafterglow. We show that the steady latent heat of quark star phase transition\nwould continuously inject into GRB afterglow in a form similar to that of a\nPoyntingflux- dominated outflow and naturally produce the shallow decay phase\nand the abrupt falloff after plateau. We conclude that the latent heat of quark\nstar phase transition would be an important contribution to the shallow decay\nradiation in GRB afterglow, and would explain the general features of GRB light\ncurves (including the plateau), if pulsar-like stars are really (solid) quark\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 03:45:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 07:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-26"}

The technique consists in generating\nstreamwise-modulated waves of spanwise velocity at the wall, that travel in the\nstreamwise direction.\n  A proof-of-principle experiment has been devised to measure the reduction of\nturbulent friction in a pipe flow, in which the wall is subdivided into thin\nslabs that rotate independently in the azimuthal direction. Different speeds of\nnearby slabs provide, although in a discrete setting, the desired streamwise\nvariation of transverse velocity.\n  Our experiment confirms the available DNS results, and in particular\ndemonstrates the possibility of achieving large reductions of friction in the\nturbulent regime. Reductions up to 33% are obtained for slowly\nforward-traveling waves; backward-traveling waves invariably yield drag\nreduction, whereas a substantial drop of drag reduction occurs for waves\ntraveling forward with a phase speed comparable to the convection speed of\nnear-wall turbulent structures.\n  A Fourier analysis is employed to show that the first harmonics introduced by\nthe discrete spatial waveform that approximates the sinusoidal wave are\nresponsible for significant effects that are indeed observed in the\nexperimental measurements. Practical issues related to the physical\nimplementation of this control scheme and its energetic efficiency are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 07:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Large\ncurrent spikes at the device terminals result in electromagnetic disturbances\nwhich can establish resonant patterns affecting the operation of the whole\nsystem. These effects have been examined using a finite difference time domain\napproach to solve Maxwell's equations for the PCB power and ground plane\nconfiguration. The simulation domain is terminated with a uniaxial perfectly\nmatched layer to prevent unwanted reflections. This approach calculates the\nfield values as a function of position and time and allows the evolution of the\nfield to be visualized. The propagation of a pulse over the ground plane was\nobserved demonstrating the establishment of a complex interference pattern\nbetween source and reflected wave fronts and then between multiply reflected\nwave fronts. This interference which affects the whole ground plane area could\nadversely affect the operation of any device on the board. These resonant waves\npersist for a significant time after the initial pulse. Examining the FFT of\nthe ground plane electric field response showed numerous resonant peaks at\nfrequencies consistent with the expected values assuming the PCB can be\nmodelled as a resonant cavity with two electric and four magnetic field\nboundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 09:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}

Since Algols are eclipsing binaries the\ndistribution of their orbital periods is precisely known. The distribution of\ntheir mass ratios contains however more uncertainties. We try to reproduce\nthese two distributions theoretically using a liberal scenario in which the\ngainer star can lose mass into interstellar space as a consequence of its rapid\nrotation and the energy of a hot spot. In a recent paper (Van Rensbergen et al.\n2010, A&A) we calculated the liberal evolution of binaries with a B-type\nprimary at birth where mass transfer starts during core hydrogen burning of the\ndonor. In this paper we include the cases where mass transfer starts during\nhydrogen shell burning and it is our aim to reproduce the observed\ndistributions of the system parameters of Algol-type semi-detached systems. Our\ncalculations reveal the amount of time that an Algol binary lives with a well\ndefined value of mass ratio and orbital period. We use these data to simulate\nthe distribution of mass ratios and orbital periods of Algols. Binaries with a\nlate B-type initial primary hardly lose any mass whereas those with an early B\nprimary evolve in a non-conservative way. Conservative binary evolution\npredicts only ~ 12 % of Algols with a mass ratio q above 0.4. This value is\nraised up to ~ 17 % using our scenario of liberal evolution, which is still far\nbelow the ~ 45 % that is observed.

Among other\nscenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through\nplanet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded\nplanets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,\nplanet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the\nobserved high eccentricity of exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 13:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

One intriguing possibility is that the\naccretion flow onto the central supermassive black hole is responsible for\naccelerating protons to TeV energies which then diffuse outward to interact\nwith molecular gas at distances of ~1 pc. Here, we build on our earlier\ndetailed calculations of the proton transport to consider the time and energy\ndependence of the TeV signal following a burst of particle acceleration at Sgr\nA*. We find that, due to the strong energy dependence of the proton diffusion,\nany variability in the particle acceleration rate will only be visible in the\nTeV signal after a delay of ~ 10 yrs, and only at energies >~ 10 TeV. If the\naccelerator is long-lived it must have been running for at least 10^4 yrs and\nhave a hard proton injection spectrum of \\alpha=0.7 (where dn/dE_inj \\propto\nE^{-\\alpha}) in order to produce the correct amount of high energy gamma-ray\nflux. This rapid diffusion of high energy protons also rules out the\npossibility that the observed TeV source is directly related to the period of\nincreased activity of Sgr A* that ended ~ 100 yrs ago. However, a good fit to\nthe observed H.E.S.S. data was found with \\alpha=2.7 for the scenario of a\nbrief (~few year long) burst of particle acceleration that occurred ~ 10 yrs\nago. If such bursts are common then they will keep the TeV source energised and\nwill likely produce spectral variability at >~ 10 TeV on <~ 5 yr timescales.\nThis model also implies that particle acceleration may be an important\nmechanism in reducing the radiative efficiency of weakly accreting black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 14:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The initial discoveries of SN 2005ap by\nthe Texas Supernova Search and SCP-06F6 in a deep Hubble pencil beam survey\nwere followed by the Palomar Transient Factory confirmation of host redshifts\nfor other similar transients.

The physical mechanism that produces the\nluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion to\npulsational pair-instability. Here we report the most detailed photometric and\nspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (SN 2010gx) detected in the\nPan-STARRS 1 sky survey. In common with other transients in this family,\nearly-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption lines\nof O II.

This poses problems in\nunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication from\nlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56Ni, the broad\nlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolution\nis quite different from typical Ic timescales.

Paired electrons, however, cannot form a superconducting condensate\nspontaneously. These paired electrons perform disorderly zero-point\noscillations and there are no force of attraction in their ensemble. In order\nto create a unified ensemble of particles, the pairs must order their\nzero-point fluctuations so that an attraction between the particles appears. As\na result of this ordering of zero-point oscillations in the electron gas,\nsuperconductivity arises.

In the\ncurrent work, we focus on the \"community detection\" problem when cast in terms\nof a general Potts spin glass type problem. As such, our results apply to\nrather broad Potts spin glass type systems. Community detection describes the\ngeneral problem of partitioning a complex system involving many elements into\noptimally decoupled \"communities\" of such elements. We report on phase\ntransitions between solvable and unsolvable regimes. Solvable region may\nfurther split into \"easy\" and \"hard\" phases. Spin glass type phase transitions\nappear at both low and high temperatures (or noise). Low temperature\ntransitions correspond to an \"order by disorder\" type effect wherein\nfluctuations render the system ordered or solvable. Separate transitions appear\nat higher temperatures into a disordered (or an unsolvable) phase. Different\nsorts of randomness lead to disparate behaviors. We illustrate the spin glass\ncharacter of both transitions and report on memory effects. We further relate\nPotts type spin systems to mechanical analogs and suggest how chaotic-type\nbehavior in general thermodynamic systems can indeed naturally arise in\nhard-computational problems and spin-glasses.
