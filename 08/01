The wiggling of the Herbig Be star's\njet is evidence for an additional companion which could in fact be generating\nthe EXOR outbursts, the last of which began in 2008 (Grankin & Artemenko 2009).\nIndeed the dy- namical scale of the wiggling corresponds to a time-scale of 4-8\nyears which is in agreement with the time-scale of these outbursts. The\nspectro-images also show a bow-shock shaped feature and possible associated\nknots. The origin of this structure is as of yet unclear. Finally interesting\nlow velocity structure is also observed. One possibility is that it originates\nin a wide-angle outflow launched from a circumbinary disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2010 17:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Such a measurement will offer the first\nexperimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a\nconsequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is\nto determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial\nanalyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes.

Our focus is\nquantifying the mean abundance and abundance dispersion in iron and carbon, and\nsearching for distant radial-velocity members, in these systems.\n  The primary conclusion of our investigation is that the spread of carbon\nabundance in both Bootes I and Segue 1 is large. For Bootes I, 4 of our 16\nvelocity members have [C/H] < ~-3.1, while 2 have [C/H] > ~-2.3, suggesting a\nrange of Delta[C/H] ~ 0.8. For Segue 1 there exists a range Delta[C/H] ~ 1.0,\nincluding our discovery of a star with [Fe/H] = -3.5 and [C/Fe] = +2.3, which\nis a radial velocity member at a distance of 4 half-light radii from the system\ncenter. The accompanying ranges in iron abundance are Delta[Fe/H] ~ 1.6 for\nboth Bootes I and Segue 1. For [Fe/H] < -3.0, the Galaxy's dwarf galaxy\nsatellites exhibit a dependence of [C/Fe] on [Fe/H] which is very similar to\nthat observed in its halo populations.

The very low mean metallicity of Segue 1, and the\nhigh carbon dispersion in Bootes I, consistent with inhomogeneous chemical\nevolution in near zero-abundance gas, suggest these ultra-faint systems could\nbe surviving examples of the very first bound systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 01:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Bar strengths based on the gravitational torque method are\nderived from 2.2 micron Ks-band images for a statistical sample of 138 (98 S0,\n40 S0/a,Sa) galaxies having a mean total blue magnitude <B_T> <= 12.5 and\ngenerally inclined less than 65 degrees.

The differences are significant and\ncannot be due entirely to uncertainties in the assumed vertical scale-heights\nor in the assumption of constant mass-to-light ratios. Part of the difference\nis likely due simply to the dilution of the bar torques by the higher mass\nbulges seen in S0s.

Visible AO ({\\lambda} < 1 micron) has proven to be difficult\nbecause shorter wavelengths require wavefront correction on very short spatial\nand temporal scales. The pupil must be sampled very finely, which requires\ndense actuator spacing and fine wavefront sampling with large dynamic range. In\naddition, atmospheric dispersion is much more significant in the visible than\nin the near-IR. Imaging over a broad visible band requires a very good\nAtmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC). Even with these technologies, our AO\nsimulations using the CAOS code, combined with the optical and site parameters\nfor the 6.5m Magellan telescope, demonstrate a large temporal variability of\nvisible ({\\lambda}=0.7 micron) Strehl on timescales of 50 ms. Over several\nhundred milliseconds, the visible Strehl can be as high at 50% and as low as\n10%. Taking advantage of periods of high Strehl requires either the ability to\nread out the CCD very fast, thereby introducing significant amounts of\nread-noise, or the use of a fast asynchronous shutter that can block the\nlow-Strehl light. Our Magellan VisAO camera will use an advanced ADC, a\nhigh-speed shutter, and our 585 actuator adaptive secondary to achieve\nbroadband (0.5-1.0 micron) diffraction limited images on the 6.5m Magellan Clay\ntelescope in Chile at Las Campanas Observatory. These will be the sharpest and\ndeepest visible direct images taken to date with a resolution of 17 mas, a\nfactor of 2.7 better than the diffraction limit of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 04:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

Furthermore, the\naction should include covariant derivatives of the matter fields, with the\ncovariant derivative naturally defined using the independent connection. As a\nresult, in metric-affine theories a direct coupling involving matter and\nconnection is also present. The role and the dynamics of the connection in such\ntheories is explored. We employ power counting in order to construct the action\nand search for the minimal requirements it should satisfy for the connection to\nbe dynamical. We find that for the most general action containing lower order\ninvariants of the curvature and the torsion the independent connection does not\ncarry any dynamics. It actually reduces to the role of an auxiliary field and\ncan be completely eliminated algebraically in favour of the metric and the\nmatter field, introducing extra interactions with respect to general\nrelativity. However, we also show that including higher order terms in the\naction radically changes this picture and excites new degrees of freedom in the\nconnection, making it (or parts of it) dynamical. Constructing actions that\nconstitute exceptions to this rule requires significant fine tuned and/or extra\na priori constraints on the connection.
