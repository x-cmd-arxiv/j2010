We recently completed an exploratory\nsurvey of FUors using XMM-Newton to determine their X-ray properties, about\nwhich little was previously known. The prototype FU Ori and V1735 Cyg were\ndetected. The X-ray spectrum of FU Ori was found to be unusual, consisting of a\ncool moderately-absorbed component plus a hotter component viewed through an\nabsorption column density that is an order of magnitude higher. We present here\na sensitive (99 ks) follow-up X-ray observation of FU Ori obtained at higher\nangular resolution with Chandra ACIS-S. The unusual multi-component spectrum is\nconfirmed. The hot component is centered on FU Ori and dominates the emission\nabove 2 keV. It is variable (a signature of magnetic activity) and is probably\ncoronal emission originating close to FU Ori's surface viewed through cool gas\nin FU Ori's strong wind or accretion stream. In contrast, the X-ray centroid of\nthe soft emission below 2 keV is offset 0.20 arcsec to the southeast of FU Ori,\ntoward the near-IR companion (FU Ori S). This offset amounts to slightly less\nthan half the separation between the two stars. The most likely explanation for\nthe offset is that the companion contributes significantly to the softer X-ray\nemission below 2 keV (and weakly above 2 keV).

Simulations indicate\nthat halos should all have roughly the same spherically-averaged density\nprofile and kinematic structure, and predict simple distributions of shape,\nformation history and substructure in density and kinematics, over an enormous\nrange of halo mass and for all common variants of the concordance cosmology. I\ndescribe observational progress towards testing these predictions by measuring\nmasses, shapes, profiles and substructure in real halos, using baryonic tracers\nor gravitational lensing. An important property of simulated halos (possibly\nthe most important property) is their dynamical 'age', or degree of internal\nrelaxation. The age of a halo may have almost as much effect as its mass in\ndetermining the state of its baryonic contents, so halo ages are also worth\ntrying to measure observationally.

In\norder for the fermionic effects to dominate gauge field effects in the\neffective potential, the fermion mass must be sufficiently small. This\nindicates that chiral symmetry breaking effects are potentially important. We\ndevelop a Polyakov-Nambu-Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model which combines the known\nperturbative behavior of adjoint QCD models at small L with chiral symmetry\nbreaking effects to produce an effective potential for the Polyakov loop P and\nthe chiral order parameter psi-bar psi. A rich phase structure emerges from the\neffective potential. Our results are consistent with the recent lattice\nsimulations of Cossu and D'Elia, which found no evidence for a direct\nconnection between the small-L and large-L confining regions. Nevertheless, the\ntwo confined regions are connected indirectly if an extended field theory model\nwith an irrelevant four-fermion interaction is considered. Thus the small-L and\nlarge-L regions are part of a single confined phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 20:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

This paper is addressed to these particular\naspects of the accretion disk evolution and of the growth of seeds.\n  The time-dependent hydrodynamic equations were solved numerically for an\naxi-symmetric disk in which the gravitational potential includes contributions\nboth from the central object and from the disk itself. The numerical code is\nbased on a Eulerian formalism, using a finite difference method of\nsecond-order, according to the Van Leer upwind algorithm on a staggered mesh.\n  The present simulations indicate that seeds capture about a half of the\ninitial disk mass, a result weakly dependent on model parameters.

This paper aims to characterize the global\nproperties of the iS-graph in terms of: (i) percolation on the infinite plane,\nand (ii) full connectivity on a finite region. First, for the Poisson iS-graph\ndefined on the infinite plane, the existence of a phase transition is proven,\nwhereby an unbounded component of connected nodes suddenly arises as the\ndensity of legitimate nodes is increased. This shows that long-range secure\ncommunication is still possible in the presence of eavesdroppers. Second, full\nconnectivity on a finite region of the Poisson iS-graph is considered. The\nexact asymptotic behavior of full connectivity in the limit of a large density\nof legitimate nodes is characterized. Then, simple, explicit expressions are\nderived in order to closely approximate the probability of full connectivity\nfor a finite density of legitimate nodes.

Connected quadruple\nexcitations, \\hat{T}_4, have significant and systematic effects on r_e,\n\\omega_e, and \\omega_e x_e, in particular they universally increase r_e (by up\nto 0.5 pm), universally reduce \\omega_e (by up to 32 cm^{-1}), and universally\nincrease \\omega_e x_e (by up to 1 cm^{-1}). Connected quintuple excitations,\n\\hat{T}_5, are spectroscopically significant for \\omega_e of the nonhydride\nsystems, affecting \\omega_e by up to 4 cm^{-1}. The triatomic molecules H_2O,\nCO_2, and O_3, as well as the pathologically multireference BN and BeO\ndiatomics, are also considered.

Finally, the\nimportance of post-CCSD(T) correlation effects for electrical properties,\nnamely dipole moments (\\mu), polarizabilities (\\alpha), and first\nhyperpolarizabilities (\\beta) is evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 21:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Finally, we combine\nour results with earlier work on the Casimir force between two spheres to\nobtain data on the leading order correction to the Proximity Force\nApproximation for two metallic spheres both outside and within one another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 00:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 02:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

Direct data domain (D3) methods avoid non-stationary\ntraining data and can effectively suppress the clutter within the test cell.\nHowever, this benefit comes at the cost of a reduced system degree of freedom\n(DOF), which results in performance loss. In this paper, by exploiting the\nintrinsic sparsity of the spectral distribution, a new direct data domain\napproach using sparse representation (D3SR) is proposed, which seeks to\nestimate the high-resolution space-time spectrum with only the test cell.

However, the relation between the ULX states and the Galactic BHB states\nis still unclear primarily due to less well-understood behaviors of ULXs in\ncontrast to the Galactic BHBs. Here, we report a statistical X-ray spectral\nstudy of 34 energy spectra from seven bright ULXs in the interacting galaxy\nsystems M51 and NGC4490/85, using archive data from multiple Chandra and\nXMM-Newton observations spanning for a few years. In order to compare with\nGalactic BHB states, we applied representative spectral models of BHBs; a\npower-law (PL), a multi-color disk black body (MCD), and a slim disk model to\nall the ULX spectra. We found a hint of a bimodal structure in the luminosity\ndistribution of the samples, suggesting that ULXs have two states with typical\nluminosities of 3-6*10^{39} and 1.5-3*10^{39} ergs/s. Most spectra in the\nbrighter state are explained by the MCD or the slim disk model, whereas those\nin the fainter state are explained by the PL model. In particular, the slim\ndisk model successfully explains the observed spectral variations of NGC4490/85\nULX-6 and ULX-8 by changes of the mass accretion rate to a black hole of an\nestimated mass of <40 Msun. From the best-fit model parameters of each state,\nwe speculate that the brighter state in these two ULXs corresponds to the\nbrightest state of Galactic BHBs, which is often called the ``apparently\nstandard state''. The fainter state of the ULXs has a PL shaped spectrum, but\nthe photon index range is much wider than that seen in any single state of\nGalactic BHBs. We thus speculate that it is a state unique to ULXs. Some\nsources show much fainter and steeper spectra than the faint state, which we\nidentified as another state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 02:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We construct simple models for the\nfull stellar phase space distributions of galaxies' disk and spheroidal\ncomponents, and reproduce the well-known result that the maximum phase density\nof an elliptical galaxy is too high to be produced collisionlessly from a disk\nsystem, although we also show that the inclusion of a bulge component in the\ndisk removes this evolutionary impediment. In order to draw more general\nconclusions about the evolution of the galaxy population, we use the Millennium\nGalaxy Catalogue to construct a model of the entire phase density distribution\nof stars in a representative sample of the local Universe. In such a composite\npopulation, we show that the mixing inequality rules out some evolutionary\npaths that are not prohibited by consideration of the maximum phase density\nalone, and thus show that the massive ellipticals in this population could not\nhave formed purely from collisionless mergers of a low mass galaxy population\nlike that found in the local Universe. Although the violation of the mixing\ninequality is in this case quite minor, and hence avoidable with a modest\namount of non-collisionless star formation in the merger process, it does\nconfirm the potential of this approach. The future measurement of stellar phase\ndensities at higher redshift will allow this potential to be fully exploited,\noffering a new way to look at the possible pathways for galaxy evolution, and\nto learn about the environment of star formation through the way that this\nphase space becomes populated over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 10:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Weaker masers, the kilomasers, seem to be\nmostly related to star formation activity, although the possibility exists that\nsome of these sources may belong to the weak tail of the AGN maser\ndistribution. It is of particular importance to accurately locate the water\nmaser emission to reveal its origin and shed light onto extragalactic star\nforming activity or to elucidate the highly obscured central regions of\ngalaxies. We performed interferometric observations of three galaxies, NGC3556,\nArp299, and NGC4151, where water emission was found. Statistical tools have\nbeen used to study the relation between OH and water maser emission in\ngalaxies. The maser in NGC3556 is associated with a compact radio continuum\nsource that is most likely a supernova remnant or radio supernova. In Arp299,\nthe luminous water maser has been decomposed in three main emitting regions\nassociated with the nuclear regions of the two main galaxies of the system,\nNGC3690 and IC694, and the region of overlap. In NGC4151, only one of the two\npreviously observed maser components has been tentatively detected. This\nfeature, if real, is associated with the galaxy's central region. The only\ngalaxy, so far, where luminous maser emission from two maser species, OH and\nH2O has been confidently detected is Arp299. Weaker masers from these two\nspecies do instead coexist in a number of objects. A larger number of objects\nsearched for both maser species are, however, necessary to better assess these\nlast two results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 11:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The first magnetic fields in O- and B-type stars that do not belong\nto the Bp-star class, have been discovered. The cyclic UV wind-line\nvariability, which has been observed in a significant fraction of early-type\nstars, is likely to be related to such magnetic fields. Aims. We attempt to\nimprove our understanding of massive-star magnetic fields, and observe\ntwenty-five carefully-selected, OB-type stars. Methods. Of these stars we\nobtain 136 magnetic field strength measurements. We present the UV wind-line\nvariability of all selected targets and summarise spectropolarimetric\nobservations acquired using the MUSICOS spectropolarimeter, mounted at the TBL,\nPic du Midi, between December 1998 and November 2004. From the average Stokes I\nand V line profiles, derived using the LSD method, we measure the magnetic\nfield strengths, radial velocities, and first moment of the line profiles.\nResults. No significant magnetic field is detected in any OB-type star that we\nobserved. Typical 1{\\sigma} errors are between 15 and 200 G. A possible\nmagnetic-field detection for the O9V star 10 Lac remains uncertain, because the\nfield measurements depend critically on the fringe- effect correction in the\nStokes V spectra. We find excess emission in UV-wind lines, centred about the\nrest wavelength, to be a new indirect indicator of the presence of a magnetic\nfield in early B-type stars. The most promising candidates to host magnetic\nfields are the B-type stars {\\delta} Cet and 6 Cep, and a number of O stars.\nConclusions. Although some O and B stars have strong dipolar field, which cause\nperiodic variability in the UV wind-lines, such strong fields are not\nwidespread. If the variability observed in the UV wind-lines of OB stars is\ngenerally caused by surface magnetic fields, these fields are either weak\n(<~few hundred G) or localised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 12:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-15"}

The former\neffect increases the survival probability of the dipoles, since color filtering\nin one nucleus makes the other one more transparent. The second effect acts in\nthe opposite direction and is stronger, it makes the colliding nuclei more\nopaque than in the case of pA collisions. As a result of parton saturation in\nnuclei the effective scale is shifted upwards, what leads to an increase of the\ngluon density at small x. This in turn leads to a stronger transverse momentum\nbroadening in AA compared with pA collisions, i.e. to an additional growth of\nthe saturation momentum. Such a mutual boosting leads to a system of\nreciprocity equations, which result in a saturation scale, a few times higher\nin AA than in pA collisions at the energies of LHC. Since the dipole cross\nsection is proportional to the saturation momentum squared, the nuclei become\nmuch more opaque for dipoles in AA than in pA collisions. For the same reason\ngluon shadowing turns out to be boosted to a larger magnitude compared with the\nproduct of the gluon shadowing factors in each of the colliding nuclei. All\nthese effects make it more difficult to establish a baseline for anomalous\nJ/Psi suppression in heavy ion collisions at high energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 13:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2010 23:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-18"}

We find that episodic accretion can produce objects with significantly\nhigher central temperatures than the ones of the non accreting counterparts of\nsame mass and age. As a consequence, lithium depletion can be severely enhanced\nin these objects. This provides a natural explanation for the unexpected level\nof lithium depletion observed in young objects for the inferred age of their\nparent cluster. These results confirm the limited reliability of lithium\nabundance as a criterion for assessing or rejecting cluster membership. They\nalso show that lithium is not a reliable age indicator, because its fate\nstrongly depends on the past accretion history of the star. Under the\nassumption that giant planets primarily form in massive disks prone to\ngravitational instability and thus to accretion burst episodes, the same\nanalysis also explains the higher Li depletion observed in planet hosting\nstars. At last, we show that, depending on the burst rate and intensity,\naccretion outbursts can produce solar mass stars with lower convective envelope\nmasses, at ages less than a few tens of Myr, than predicted by standard (non or\nslowly accreting) pre-main sequence models. This result has interesting,\nalthough speculative, implications for the recently discovered depletion of\nrefractory elements in the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 14:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

As the temperature T approaches\n0, all samples exhibit static incommensurate magnetic order with propagation\nvector along the a-direction in the CuO2 planes. The incommensurability delta\nincreases monotonically with hole concentration, as it does in LSCO. However,\ndelta is generally smaller than in LSCO at the same doping level. The intensity\nof the incommensurate Bragg reflections increases with magnetic field for\nYBCO(6.45) (superconducting Tc = 35 K), whereas it is field-independent for\nYBCO(6.35) (Tc = 10 K). These results suggest that YBCO samples with x ~ 0.5\nexhibit incommensurate magnetic order in the high fields used for the recent\nquantum oscillation experiments on this system, which likely induces a\nreconstruction of the Fermi surface. We present neutron spin-echo measurements\n(with energy resolution ~ 1 micro-eV) for T > 0 that demonstrate a continuous\nthermal broadening of the incommensurate magnetic Bragg reflections into a\nquasielastic peak centered at excitation energy E = 0, consistent with the\nzero-temperature transition expected for a two-dimensional spin system with\nfull spin-rotation symmetry. Measurements on YBCO(6.45) with a triple-axis\nspectrometer (with energy resolution ~ 100 micro-eV) yield a crossover\ntemperature T_SDW ~ 30 K for the onset of quasi-static magnetic order.
