This allows the employment of the standard viscous\nevolution equations, and gives promising results. It is, however, still not\nclear when such an approximation is appropriate. This paper tests this\napproximation using high resolution 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of self-gravitating protostellar discs with radiative transfer. The\nnature of angular momentum transport associated with the gravitational\ninstability is characterised as a function of both the stellar mass and the\ndisc-to-star mass ratio. The effective viscosity is calculated from the\nReynolds and gravitational stresses in the disc. This is then compared to what\nwould be expected if the effective viscosity were determined by assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium or, equivalently, that the local dissipation rate\nmatches the local cooling rate. In general, all the discs considered here\nsettle into a self-regulated state where the heating generated by the\ngravitational instability is modulated by the local radiative cooling. It is\nfound that low-mass discs can indeed be represented by a local\n\"alpha-parametrisation\", provided that the disc aspect ratio is small (H/R <\n0.1) which is generally the case when the disc-to-star mass ratio q <0.5.\nHowever, this result does not extend to discs with masses approaching that of\nthe central object. These are subject to transient burst events and global wave\ntransport, and the effective viscosity is not well modelled by assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. In spite of these effects, it is shown that massive\n(compact) discs can remain stable and not fragment, evolving rapidly to reduce\ntheir disc-to-star mass ratios through stellar accretion and radial spreading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 17:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that\nnatural depletion of the gas reservoir through star formation (i.e. in the\nabsence of any feedback from the AGN) induces a blue-to-red reddening rate that\nis several factors lower than that observed in S07. This is because the gas\ndepletion rate due to star formation alone is too slow, implying that another\nprocess needs to be invoked to remove gas from the system and accelerate the\nreddening rate. We develop a simple phenomenological model, in which a fraction\nof the AGN's luminosity couples to the gas reservoir over a certain 'feedback\ntimescale' and removes part of the gas mass from the galaxy, while the\nremaining gas continues to contribute to star formation. We use the model to\ninvestigate scenarios which yield migration times consistent with the results\nof S07. We find that acceptable models have feedback timescales <0.2 Gyrs.

In\nthis first paper we present the observations, color-magnitude diagrams, and the\nSFHs of the 18 starburst galaxies, based on a homogeneous approach to the data\nreduction, differential extinction, and treatment of photometric completeness.\nWe adopt a star formation rate (SFR) threshold normalized to the average SFR of\nthe individual system as a metric for classifying starbursts in SFHs derived\nfrom resolved stellar populations. This choice facilitates finding not only\ncurrently bursting galaxies but also \"fossil\" bursts increasing the sample size\nof starburst galaxies in the nearby (D<8 Mpc) universe. Thirteen of the\neighteen galaxies are experiencing ongoing bursts and five galaxies show fossil\nbursts. From our reconstructed SFHs, it is evident that the elevated SFRs of a\nburst are sustained for hundreds of Myr with variations on small timescales. A\nlong >100 Myr temporal baseline is thus fundamental to any starburst definition\nor identification method. The longer lived bursts rule out rapid\n\"self-quenching\" of starbursts on global scales. The bursting galaxies' gas\nconsumption timescales are shorter than the Hubble time for all but one galaxy\nconfirming the short-lived nature of starbursts based on fuel limitations.\nAdditionally, we find the strength of the H{\\alpha} emission usually correlates\nwith the CMD based SFR during the last 4-10 Myr. However, in four cases, the\nH{\\alpha} emission is significantly less than what is expected for models of\nstarbursts; the discrepancy is due to the SFR changing on timescales of a few\nMyr. The inherently short timescale of the H{\\alpha} emission limits\nidentifying galaxies as starbursts based on the current characteristics which\nmay or may not be representative of the recent SFH of a galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 20:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Balmer-line fits and ionization equlibria give a relation\nbetween Teff, and log(g). Abundance anomalies and uncertain reddening preclude\nthe use of spectral type or photometry to fix Teff. Excitation temperatures are\nused to break the degeneracy between Teff and log(g).\n  Results: Strong lines are subject to an anomalous saturation that cannot be\nremoved by assuming a low microturbulence.

We also use the predictive process models adapted from the\nspatial statistics literature to overcome the computational limitations, thus\nextending the applicability of this popular technique to a new problem.\nModifications of predictive process models are nevertheless critical in our\ncontext to obtain valid inferences. The numerical results presented demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 08:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-11"}

Evils of global worry such as syndrome discovery and\nmanage, terror campaign, immigration and border control, prohibited drug\ntrafficking, and more demand information sharing, harmonization and cooperation\namid government agencies within a country and across national borders. A number\nof daunting challenges survive to the progress of an efficient information\nsharing protocol. A secure and trusted information-sharing protocol is required\nto enable users to interact and share information easily and perfectly across\nmany diverse networks and databases globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 08:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-11"}

The most of the metrics need to find the interactions between\nthe objects and modules for developing necessary metric and an influential\nsoftware measure that is attracting the software developers, designers and\nresearchers. In this paper a new interactions are defined for object oriented\nsystem. Using these interactions, a parser is developed to analyze the existing\narchitecture of the software. Within the design model, it is necessary for\ndesign classes to collaborate with one another. However, collaboration should\nbe kept to an acceptable minimum i.e. better designing practice will introduce\nlow coupling. If a design model is highly coupled, the system is difficult to\nimplement, to test and to maintain overtime. In case of enhancing software, we\nneed to introduce or remove module and in that case coupling is the most\nimportant factor to be considered because unnecessary coupling may make the\nsystem unstable and may cause reduction in the system's performance. So\ncoupling is thought to be a desirable goal in software construction, leading to\nbetter values for external software qualities such as maintainability,\nreusability and so on. To test this hypothesis, a good measure of class\ncoupling is needed. In this paper, based on the developed tool called Design\nAnalyzer we propose a methodology to reuse an existing system with the\nobjective of enhancing an existing Object oriented system keeping the coupling\nas low as possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 09:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-11"}

These models,\nalthough slightly different exhibit common features which are pointed out. We\nalso consider $1+1$ dimensional toy models for coupling fermionic matter fields\nto braneworld. In particular, we focus on a kink or kink/anti-kink solution of\nthe Sine-Gordon model, which can be seen as modeling a brane in the dimensions\ntransverse to our four dimensional spacetime. We also analyze the stability of\nthree particular models admitting kink or anti-kink like solutions and show\nthat the stability equations are Poschl-Teller equations. In the second part\nafter quickly reviewing available analytically known solutions, we present the\nnumerical construction of the higher dimensional charged rotating black hole\nwith a cosmological constant.

Our result suggest\nthe existence of a thermodynamically stable phase of non uniform black string\nand point to the presence of a phase of AdS localized black hole. Moreover, we\nargue that the phase transition from uniform to non uniform black strings can\nbe of order larger than one in any number of dimensions, which is not the case\nwithout a cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 09:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-11"}

Here\nself-similarity means that $(a^{-H}\\WH(at): t \\ge 0) \\stackrel{d}{=} (\\WH(t): t\n\\ge 0)$, where $H\\in (0, 1)$ is the Hurst parameter of fractional Brownian\nmotion.\n  F.B.

This report takes\nup this challenge, presenting a natural inductive construction of explicit\ncubical cocyle conditions, and gives three ways in which the simplicial ones\ncan be derived from these. (A dual string-diagram version of this work, giving\nrise to a Pascal's triangle of diagrams for cocycle conditions, has been\ndescribed elsewhere by Street). A consequence of this work is that the\nYang-Baxter equation, the `pentagon of pentagons', and higher simplex\nequations, are in essence different manifestations of the same underlying\nabstract structure. There has been recent interest in higher-categories, by\ncomputer scientists investigating concurrency theory, as well as by physicists,\namong others.

Observationally, white light observations\nhave recorded many occurrences of a thin ray appearing behind a CME eruption\nthat closely resembles a post-CME CS in its spatial correspondence and\nmorphology. UV and X-ray observations further strengthen this interpretation by\nthe observations of high temperature emission at locations consistent with\nmodel predictions. The next question then becomes whether the properties inside\na post-CME CS predicted by a model agree with observed properties. In this\nwork, we assume that the post-CME CS is a consequence of Petschek-like\nreconnection and that the observed ray-like structure is bounded by a pair of\nslow mode shocks developed from the reconnection site. We perform\ntime-dependent ionization calculations and model the UV line emission. We find\nthat such a model is consistent with SOHO/UVCS observations of the post-CME CS.\nThe change of Fe XVIII emission in one event implies an inflow speed of ~10\nkm/s and a corresponding reconnection rate of M_A ~ 0.01. We calculate the\nexpected X-ray emission for comparison with X-ray observations by Hinode/XRT,\nas well as the ionic charge states as would be measured in-situ at 1 AU. We\nfind that the predicted count rate for Hinode/XRT agree with what was observed\nin a post-CME CS on April 9, 2008, and the predicted ionic charge states are\nconsistent with high ionization states commonly measured in the interplanetary\nCMEs. The model results depend strongly on the physical parameters in the\nambient corona, namely the coronal magnetic field, the electron density and\ntemperature during the CME event. It is crucial to obtain these ambient coronal\nparameters and as many facets of the CS properties as possible by observational\nmeans so that the post-CME current sheet models can be scrutinized more\neffectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 14:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
