The analysis of this tradeoff considers both the transmission\nenergy as well as the energy consumed at the receiver to process the received\nsignal. While previous work considers linear decoder complexity, which is only\nachieved by uncoded transmission, this paper claims that the average processing\n(or computation) energy per symbol depends exponentially on the information\nrate of the source message. The introduced framework is parametrized in a way\nthat it reflects properties of fixed and wireless networks alike.\n  The analysis of this paper shows that exponential complexity and therefore\nstronger codes are preferable at low data rates while linear complexity and\ntherefore uncoded transmission becomes preferable at high data rates. The more\nthe computation energy is emphasized (such as in fixed networks), the less hops\nare optimal and the lower is the benefit of multi-hopping. On the other hand,\nthe higher the information rate of the single-hop network, the higher the\nbenefits of multi-hopping.

It would also provide invaluable information on bulge scale stellar\nprocesses (such as two-body relaxation) via the rate at which stars are\ninjected into the tidal sphere of influence of the black holes. This rate, in\nturn, is essential to predict gravitational radiation emission by compact\nobject inspirals. The signature of a tidal disruption event is thought to be a\nfallback rate for the stellar debris onto the black hole that decreases as\n$t^{-5/3}$. This mass flux is often assumed to yield a luminous signal that\ndecreases in time at the same rate. In this paper, we calculate the\nmonochromatic lightcurves arising from such an accretion event. Differently\nfrom previous studies, we adopt a more realistic description of the fallback\nrate and of the super-Eddigton accretion physics. We also provide simultaneous\nlightcurves in optical, UV and X-rays.

First,\nstellar-velocity dispersions determined from aperture spectra (e.g. SDSS fiber\nspectra or unresolved data from distant galaxies) can be biased, depending on\naperture size, AGN contamination, and host-galaxy morphology.

By comparing the HeII and HI Lyman-alpha forests along a particular\nline of sight, one can trace fluctuations in the hardness of the radiation\nfield (which are driven by fluctuations in the HeII ionization rate). Because\nthis high-energy background is highly variable - thanks to the rarity of the\nbright quasars that dominate it and the relatively short attenuation lengths of\nthese photons - it is straightforward to associate features in the radiation\nfield with their source quasars. Here we quantify how finite lifetimes and\nbeamed emission geometries affect these expectations. Finite lifetimes induce a\ntime delay that displaces the observed radiation peak relative to the quasar.\nFor beamed emission, geometry dictates that sources invisible to the observer\ncan still create a peak in the radiation field. We show that both these models\nproduce substantial populations of \"bare\" peaks (without an associated quasar)\nfor reasonable parameter values (lifetimes ~10^6-10^8 yr and beaming angles <90\ndegrees).

This is one of the first\nconcrete results of the self-force program, and provides an exact point of\ncomparison with approximate post-Newtonian (PN) computations of the ISCO. Here\nthis exact ISCO shift is compared with nearly all known PN-based methods. These\ninclude both \"nonresummed\" and \"resummed\" approaches (the latter reproduce the\ntest-particle limit by construction). The best agreement with the exact result\nis found from effective-one-body (EOB) calculations that are fit to numerical\nrelativity simulations. However, if one considers uncalibrated methods based\nonly on the currently known 3PN-order conservative dynamics, the best agreement\nis found from the gauge-invariant ISCO condition of Blanchet and Iyer (2003).\nThis method reproduces the exact test-particle limit without any resummation. A\ncomparison of PN methods with the equal-mass ISCO is also performed. The\nresults of this study suggest that the EOB approach---while exactly\nincorporating the conservative test-particle dynamics---does not (in the\nabsence of calibration) incorporate conservative self-force effects more\naccurately than standard PN methods. I also consider how the conservative\nself-force ISCO shift, combined with numerical relativity computations of the\nISCO, can be used to constrain our knowledge of (1) the EOB effective metric,\n(2) phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown templates, and (3) 4PN and 5PN\norder terms in the PN orbital energy. These constraints could help in\nconstructing better gravitational-wave templates.

We describe the Recurrence Plots in terms of the\nRecurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which allows us to identify the\ntransition between different dynamical regimes. We demonstrate that this new\ntechnique is able to detect the chaos onset very efficiently, and to provide\nits quantitative measure. The chaos typically occurs when the conserved energy\nis raised to a sufficiently high level that allows the particles to traverse\nthe equatorial plane. We find that the role of the black-hole spin in setting\nthe chaos is more complicated than initially thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2010 06:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-12"}

Besides\nthe Coulomb interaction of the point electron with the proton, its strong\nCoulomb interaction with the physical vacuum as well as the magnetic\ninteraction between moving charges are taken into account. The vacuum\ninteraction leads to the motion of the electron with the velocity of light\n\\textit{c} in the circle with the radius being equal to the so-called classical\nelectron radius $r_e$. Therefore, the velocity of the electron consists of two\ncomponents: the velocity $\\vec{\\upsilon}$ of the mechanical motion and the\nvelocity $\\vec{c}$ of the photon-like motion. We postulate that\n$\\vec{\\upsilon}\\bot \\vec{c}$, and $\\upsilon < c $. Hence, the electron inside\nthe atom moves with the resulting faster-than-light velocity.

The\nset of frequencies on which the laser oscillates, and therefore the pulse\nrepetition rate, is controlled by the geometry of resonator-internal optical\nelements, not by the cavity length. Finally, the bandwidth of the laser can be\ncontrolled by switching gain modules on and off.

Propagation in form of CR diffusion and streaming tends to\ndrive the CR radial profiles towards being flat, with equal CR number density\neverywhere. Advection of CR by the turbulent gas motions tends to produce\ncentrally enhanced profiles. We assume that the CR streaming velocity is of the\norder of the sound velocity. This is motivated by plasma physical arguments.\nThe CR streaming is then usually larger than typical advection velocities and\nbecomes comparable or lower than this only for periods with trans- and\nsuper-sonic cluster turbulence. As a consequence a bimodality of the CR spatial\ndistribution results. Strongly turbulent, merging clusters should have a more\ncentrally concentrated CR energy density profile with respect to relaxed ones\nwith very subsonic turbulence. This translates into a bimodality of the\nexpected diffuse radio and gamma-ray emission of clusters, since more centrally\nconcentrated CR will find higher target densities for hadronic CR proton\ninteractions, higher plasma wave energy densities for CR electron and proton\nre-acceleration, and stronger magnetic fields. Thus, the observed bimodality of\ncluster radio halos appears to be a natural consequence of the interplay of CR\ntransport processes, independent of the model of radio halo formation, be it\nhadronic interactions of CR protons or re-acceleration of low-energy CR\nelectrons. Energy dependence of the CR propagation should lead to spectral\nsteepening of dying radio halos. Furthermore, we show that the interplay of CR\ndiffusion with advection implies first order CR re-acceleration in the\npressure-stratified atmospheres of galaxy clusters. Finally, we argue that CR\nstreaming could be important in turbulent cool cores of galaxy clusters since\nit heats preferentially the central gas with highest cooling rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2010 13:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 16:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These Doppler shifts\nhave been associated with outward propagating disturbances observed with\nExtreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray imagers. Since these instruments can have\nbroad temperature responses we investigate these intensity fluctuations using\nthe monochromatic imaging capabilities of EIS and confirm their 1 MK nature. We\nalso find that the Fe XII 195.119 A blue shifted spectral profiles at their\nfootpoints exhibit transient blue wing enhancements on timescales as short as\nthe 5 minute cadence. We have also looked at the fan peripheral loops observed\nat 0.6 MK in Si VII 275.368 A in those regions and find no sign of the\nrecurrent outward propagating disturbances with velocities of 40 - 130 km/s\nseen in Fe XII. We do observe downward trends (15 - 20 km/s) consistent with\nthe characteristic red-shifts measured at their footpoints. We, therefore, find\nno evidence that the structures at these two temperatures and the intensity\nfluctuations they exhibit are related to one another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2010 14:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this paper, we analyze Gelfand-Pinsker coding scheme and capacity\nto bring out further understandings. We show that Gelfand-Pinsker capacity is\nequal to the interference-free capacity. Thus the capacity of a channel with\nnon-causal state information available only at the encoder is the same as if\nthe state information is also available at the decoder. Furthermore, the\ncapacity-achieving conditional input distributions in these two cases are the\nsame. This lets us connect the studied channel with state to the multiple\naccess channel (MAC) with correlated sources and show that under certain\nconditions, the receiver can decode both the message and the state information.\nThis dual decoding can be obtained in particular if the state sequences come\nfrom a known codebook with rate satisfying a simple constraint. In such a case,\nwe can modify Gelfand-Pinsker coding by pre-building multiple codebooks of\ninput sequences $X^n$, each codebook is for a given state sequence $S^n$, upon\ngenerating the auxiliary $U^n$ sequences. The modified Gelfand-Pinsker coding\nscheme achieves the capacity of the MAC with degraded message set and still\nallows for decoding of just the message at any state information rate.
