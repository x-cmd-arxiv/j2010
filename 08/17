By comparing with the\nvariations in reflection continuum, which are much weaker than the iron line\nvariations, we infer that the iron-line is not pulsed. The observed spectral\nvariations can be explained by variations in blackbody temperature associated\nwith rotational Doppler shifts at the neutron star surface.

Our\nresults show a correlation between AGN power (indicated by [OIII] 5007 emission\nline luminosity) and 24 micron luminosity. This result is consistent with the\n24 micron thermal emission originating from warm dust heated directly by AGN\nillumination. Applying the same correlation test for 70 micron luminosity\nagainst [OIII] luminosity we find this relation to suffer from increased\nscatter compared to that of 24 micron. In line with our results for the\nhigher-radio-frequency-selected 2Jy sample, we are able to show that much of\nthis increased scatter is due to heating by starbursts which boost the\nfar-infrared emission at 70 micron in a minority of objects (17-35%). Overall\nthis study supports previous work indicating AGN illumination as the dominant\nheating mechanism for MFIR emitting dust in the majority of low to intermediate\nredshift radio galaxies (0.03<z<0.7), with the advantage of strong statistical\nevidence. However, we find evidence that the low redshift broad-line objects\n(z<0.1) are distinct in terms of their positions on the MFIR vs. [OIII]\ncorrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 17:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

That permits an adjustment\nfor the total gas-phase S abundance because no S+ line is observed by Spitzer.\nThe gas-phase S/H abundance ratio is (7.68+/-0.30)E-6. The Ne/S abundance ratio\nmay be determined even when the weaker hydrogen line, H(7-6) here, is not\nmeasured. The mean value, adjusted for the optical S+/S++ ratio, is Ne/S =\n13.0+/-0.6. We derive the electron density versus distance from theta1OriC for\n[S III] and [S II]. Both distributions are for the most part decreasing with\nincreasing distance. A dramatic find is the presence of high-ionization Ne++\nall the way to the outer optical boundary ~12' from theta1OriC. This IR result\nis robust, whereas the optical evidence from observations of high-ionization\nspecies (e.g. O++) at the outer optical boundary suffers uncertainty because of\nscattering of emission from the much brighter inner Huygens Region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 18:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The theory most consistent with observational\nconstraints, especially thermal histories, is the so-called \"shock model\", in\nwhich chondrules were melted in solar nebula shocks. However, several problems\nhave been identified with previous shock models. These problems all pertained\nto the treatment of the radiation field, namely the input boundary condition to\nthe radiation field, the proper treatment of the opacity of solids, and the\nproper treatment of molecular line cooling. In this paper, we present the\nresults of our updated shock model, which corrects for the problems listed\nabove. Our new hydrodynamic shock code includes a complete treatment of\nmolecular line cooling due to H2O. Previously, shock models including line\ncooling predicted chondrule cooling rates exceeding 100,000 K/hr. Contrary to\nthese expectations, we have found that the effect of line cooling is minimal;\nafter the inclusion of line cooling, the cooling rates of chondrules are\n10-1000 K/hr. The reduction in the otherwise rapid cooling rates attributable\nto line cooling is due to a combination of factors, including buffering due to\nhydrogen recombination/dissociation, high column densities of water, and\nbackwarming. Our model demonstrates that the shock model for chondrule\nformation remains consistent with observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 19:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

At intermediate pattern speeds a significant fraction of\nthe resonant box orbits as well as inner long-axis tubes are destabilized by\nthe \"envelope doubling\" that arises from the Coriolis forces and are driven\ninto the destabilizing center. Thus, for pattern rotation periods .2 Gyr < Tp <\n5 Gyr, the two orbit families that are most important for maintaining\ntriaxiality are highly chaotic. As pattern speed increases there is also a\nsharp decrease in the overall fraction of prograde short-axis tubes and a\ncorresponding increase in the retrograde variety. At the highest pattern speeds\n(close to that of triaxial bars), box-like orbits undergo a sudden transition\nto a new family of stable retrograde loop-like orbits, which resemble orbits in\nthree-dimensional bars, and circulate about the short axis.

Furthermore, we compute the relation between jet asymmetry and the\nISM properties by means of Monte Carlo simulations based on a 1D propagation\nmodel for the jet through the dense medium.

The hydrodynamic\nsimulations show that asymmetries generally may be even larger than expected\nfrom the 1D model due to the complex interaction of the jet and its bow shock\nwith gaseous clumps, which goes much beyond simple energy disposal. From our\nresults, observed asymmetries of medium-sized local radio galaxies may be\nexplained by gas masses of 10^9 to 10^10 solar masses in massive elliptical\ngalaxies.

In this Letter we\nevaluate whether shallow cusps are a unique signature of a central IMBH by\nanalyzing a sample of direct N-body simulations of star clusters with and\nwithout a central IMBH. We ``observe'' the simulations as if they were HST\nimages. Shallow cusps are common in our simulation sample: star clusters\nwithout an IMBH have v >~ -0.3 in the pre-core-collapse and core-collapse\nphases. Post-core-collapse clusters without an IMBH transition to steeper\ncusps, -0.7<~ v <~ -0.4, only if the primordial binary fraction is very small,\nf_{bin}< 3 per cent, and if there are few stellar-mass black holes remaining.\nOtherwise v values overlap the range usually ascribed to the presence of an\nIMBH throughout the entire duration of the simulations. In addition, measuring\nv is intrinsically prone to significant uncertainty, therefore typical\nmeasurement errors may lead to v > -0.3 even when <v> <~ -0.4.

The transition from compact Ly-alpha emitters (Aiso ~ a\nfew arcsec^2) to extended blobs (Aiso > 10 arcsec^2) is continuous, suggesting\na single family perhaps governed by similar emission mechanisms.

Gosta, Nobel Lectures in Physics (2001-2005), World Scientific\n(2008)], there has been a huge experimental and theoretical push to try and\nilluminate a superfluid state of Wannier-Mott excitons. Excitons in quantum\nwells, generated by a laser pulse, typically diffuse only a few micrometers\nfrom the spot they are created. However, Butov et al. and Snoke et al. reported\nluminescence from indirect and direct excitons hundreds of micrometers away\nfrom the laser excitation spot in double and single quantum well (QW)\nstructures at low temperatures.

To further verify the dark excitonic superflow we\npropose several keystone experiments, including interference of superflows from\ntwo laser spots, vortex formation, scanning of moving dipole moments, and a\ngiant increase of the luminescence distance by applying one-dimensional\nconfinement potential.

Due to\nthe large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic\nproperties of steganogram behaviours, optimizing the performance of\nsteganalysers becomes an important open problem. This paper is focussed at fine\ntuning the performance of six promising steganalysers in this field, through\nfeature selection. We propose to employ Markov Blanket-Embedded Genetic\nAlgorithm (MBEGA) for stego sensitive feature selection process. In particular,\nthe embedded Markov blanket based memetic operators add or delete features (or\ngenes) from a genetic algorithm (GA) solution so as to quickly improve the\nsolution and fine-tune the search. Empirical results suggest that MBEGA is\neffective and efficient in eliminating irrelevant and redundant features based\non both Markov blanket and predictive power in classifier model.

However, signals often\narise at macroscopic scales integrating the effect of many neurons into a\nreliable pattern of activity. In order to study such large neuronal assemblies,\none is often led to derive mean-field limits summarizing the effect of the\ninteraction of a large number of neurons into an effective signal. Classical\nmean-field approaches consider the evolution of a deterministic variable, the\nmean activity, thus neglecting the stochastic nature of neural behavior. In\nthis article, we build upon two recent approaches that include correlations and\nhigher order moments in mean-field equations, and study how these stochastic\neffects influence the solutions of the mean-field equations, both in the limit\nof an infinite number of neurons and for large yet finite networks. We\nintroduce a new model, the infinite model, which arises from both equations by\na rescaling of the variables and, which is invertible for finite-size networks,\nand hence, provides equivalent equations to those previously derived models.\nThe study of this model allows us to understand qualitative behavior of such\nlarge-scale networks. We show that, though the solutions of the deterministic\nmean-field equation constitute uncorrelated solutions of the new mean-field\nequations, the stability properties of limit cycles are modified by the\npresence of correlations, and additional non-trivial behaviors including\nperiodic orbits appear when there were none in the mean field. The origin of\nall these behaviors is then explored in finite-size networks where interesting\nmesoscopic scale effects appear. This study leads us to show that the\ninfinite-size system appears as a singular limit of the network equations, and\nfor any finite network, the system will differ from the infinite system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 07:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 09:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-07"}

PKS1345+12 is a powerful\nquasar and is also the best studied case of an emission line outflow in a\nULIRG. Using the density sensitive transauroral emission lines [S II]4068,4076\nand [O II]7318,7319,7330,7331, we pilot a new technique to accurately model the\nelectron density for cases in which it is not possible to use the traditional\ndiagnostic [S II]6716/6731, namely sources with highly broadened complex\nemission line profiles and/or high (Ne > 10^4 cm^-3) electron densities. We\nmeasure electron densities of Ne=2.94x10^3 cm^-3, Ne=1.47x10^4 cm^-3 and\nNe=3.16x10^5 cm^-3 for the regions emitting the narrow, broad and very broad\ncomponents respectively. We calculate a total mass outflow rate of 8 M_sun\nyr^-1. We estimate the total mass in the warm gas outflow is 8x10^5 M_sun. The\ntotal kinetic power in the warm outflow is 3.4x10^42 erg s^-1. We find that\nonly a small fraction (0.13% of Lbol) of the available accretion power is\ndriving the warm outflow, significantly less than currently required by the\nmajority of quasar feedback models (~5-10\\% of Lbol), but similar to recent\nfindings by Hopkins et al. (2010) for a two-stage feedback model. The models\nalso predict that AGN outflows will eventually remove the gas from the bulge of\nthe host galaxy. The visible warm outflow in PKS1345+12 is not currently\ncapable of doing so. However, it is entirely possible that much of the outflow\nis either obscured by a dense and dusty natal cocoon and/or in cooler or hotter\nphases of the ISM.

However, well-sampled\nspectral energy distributions of the nearby, star-forming Magellanic Clouds\nhave a pronounced (sub-)millimeter excess (Israel et al., 2010). This study\nattempts to confirm the existence of such a millimeter excess above expected\ndust, free-free and synchrotron emission and to explore different possibilities\nfor its origin. We model NIR to radio spectral energy distributions of the\nMagellanic Clouds with dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. A millimeter\nexcess emission is confirmed above these components and its spectral shape and\nintensity are analysed in light of different scenarios: very cold dust, Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) fluctuations, a change of the dust spectral index\nand spinning dust emission. We show that very cold dust or CMB fluctuations are\nvery unlikely explanations for the observed excess in these two galaxies. The\nexcess in the LMC can be satisfactorily explained either by a change of the\nspectral index due to intrinsic properties of amorphous grains, or by spinning\ndust emission. In the SMC however, due to the importance of the excess, the\ndust grain model including TLS/DCD effects cannot reproduce the observed\nemission in a simple way. A possible solution was achieved with spinning dust\nemission, but many assumptions on the physical state of the interstellar medium\nhad to be made. Further studies, using higher resolution data from Planck and\nHerschel, are needed to probe the origin of this observed submm-cm excess more\ndefinitely. Our study shows that the different possible origins will be best\ndistinguished where the excess is the highest, as is the case in the SMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 12:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In the region delimited by a\ncharacteristic field Hon (well below $H_p$), and $H_p$, the vortex dynamics is\ncontrolled by collective pinning. For fields below Hon the activation energy,\n$U_0$, increases with field as expected for collective pinning, but the pinning\nmechanism is likely to be in the single vortex limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 12:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

The theoretical model is developed\nwithin the PDF formalism.

This equation describes various physical\nsystems such as self-gravitating Brownian particles (Smoluchowski-Poisson\nsystem), bacterial populations experiencing chemotaxis (Keller-Segel model) and\ncolloidal particles with capillary interactions. We also take into account the\ninertia of the particles and derive corresponding kinetic and hydrodynamic\nequations generalizing the usual Kramers, Jeans, Euler and Cattaneo equations.\nFor each model, we provide the corresponding form of free energy and establish\nthe H-theorem and the virial theorem.

A set of stable mock NFW dark matter haloes\nwere produced and a subhalo was placed at different radii within a larger halo.\nSUBFIND (a Friends-of-Friends based finder) and AHF (an adaptive mesh based\nfinder) were employed to recover the subhalo. As expected, we found that the\nmass of the subhalo recovered by SUBFIND has a strong dependence on the radial\nposition and that neither halo finder can accurately recover the subhalo when\nit is very near the centre of the halo. This radial dependence is shown to be\nrelated to the subhalo being truncated by the background density of the halo\nand originates due to the subhalo being defined as an overdensity. If the\nsubhalo size is instead determined using the peak of the circular velocity\nprofile, a much more stable value is recovered. The downside to this is that\nthe maximum circular velocity is a poor measure of stripping and is affected by\nresolution.

The\nsearch for close binary companions in planetary nebulae is hindered by the\ndifficulty of detecting cool, late-type, main sequence companions in binary\nsystems with hot pre-white dwarf primaries. However, models of binary PN\nprogenitor systems predict that mass accretion or tidal interactions can induce\nrapid rotation in the companion, leading to X-ray-emitting coronae. To test\nsuch models, we have searched for, and detected, X-ray emission from three\nbinary central stars within planetary nebulae: the post-common envelope close\nbinaries in HFG 1 and DS 1 consisting of O-type subdwarfs with late-type, main\nsequence companions, and the binary system in LoTr 5 consisting of O-type\nsubdwarf and rapidly rotating, late-type giant companion.

We use an axisymmetric 3D model for which both the gas and\nthe liquid are incompressible; lubrication regime applies for the gas film\ndynamics and the liquid viscosity is neglected. In the absence of surface\ntension a finite time singularity whose properties are analysed is formed and\nthe liquid touches the solid on a circle. When surface tension is taken into\naccount, a thin jet emerges from the zone of impact, skating above a thin gas\nlayer. The thickness of the air film underneath this jet is always smaller than\nthe mean free path in the gas suggesting that the liquid film eventually wets\nthe surface.

The main aim of this paper is to prove the\nTits-Weiss conjecture for Albert division algebras over $k$ which are pure\nfirst Tits constructions. This conjecture asserts that for an Albert division\nalgebra $A$ over a field $k$, every norm similarity of $A$ is inner modulo\nscalar multiplications. It is known that $k$-forms of $E_8$ with index\n$E^{78}_{8,2}$ and anisotropic kernel a strict inner $k$-form of $E_6$\ncorrespond bijectively (via Moufang hexagons) to Albert division algebras over\n$k$. The Kneser-Tits problem for a form of $E_8$ as above is equivalent to the\nTits-Weiss conjecture (see \\cite{TW}). Hence we provide a solution to the\nKneser-Tits problem for forms of $E_8$ arising from pure first Tits\nconstruction Albert division algebras. As an application, we prove that for\n$G={\\bf Aut}(A),~G(k)/R=1$, where $A$ is a pure first construction Albert\ndivision algebra over $k$ and $R$ stands for $R$-equivalence in the sense of\nManin (\\cite{M}).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 15:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-18"}

The diffuse gas has\na complex bird-like morphology, with a plume of emission extending from two\nsymmetric wing-like features, and capped with a filamentary radio relic. X-ray\nobservations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas or\nnon-thermal emission in the region of the relic. We find evidence for a weak\nelliptical X-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent with\na sloshing cold front. The plume is consistent with having formed due to uplift\nby a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. Our results\nare inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the X-ray wings formed due\nto the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. We instead conclude that\nthe wings are due to X-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radio\nrelic. The central cD galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that are\nslightly offset from their optical and UV counterparts, suggestive of a\ngalaxy-galaxy merger event. On larger scales, there is evidence for cluster\nsubstructure in both optical observations and the X-ray temperature map. We\nsuggest that Abell 133 has recently undergone a merger event with an\ninterloping subgroup, initiating gas sloshing in the core. We show that the\nadditional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can have a significant\neffect on the rise trajectories of buoyant bubbles, although this effect alone\ncannot fully explain the morphology of Abell 133. The radio observations reveal\na previously unreported background giant radio galaxy at z = 0.293, the\nnorthern lobe of which overlies the radio relic in the core of Abell 133. A\nrough estimate indicates that the contribution of this background lobe to the\ntotal radio emission in the region of the relic is modest (< 13%).
