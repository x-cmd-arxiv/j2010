Using\nthe code ATLAS in conjunction with KURUCZ06 model atmospheres we analyse 93 Fe\nlines to determine the star's macroturbulence. With this information we\nconstruct a grid of Ba synthetic spectra and, using a \\chi^2 code, fit these to\nour observed data to determine the isotopic ratio, fodd, which represents the\nratio of odd to even isotopes.

At the\nthree shorter passbands (1 - 2.5 microns), the proposed depth is comparable to\nthe deepest pencil-beam surveys done to date and is 3000 times more sensitive\nthan the only previous all-sky near-infrared survey, 2MASS. At the longest\npassband (3.5 micron), which is not feasible from the ground, NIRSS will be 500\ntimes more sensitive than WISE. NIRSS fills a pivotal gap in our knowledge of\nthe celestial sphere, is a natural complement to WISE, and is well matched to\nthe next generation of deep (0.1 uJy), wide-area (>2 pi ster), ground-based\noptical surveys (LSST and Pan-Starrs).

All these theories have something in common:\nthey can be written in terms of 3-Leibniz algebras. Here we study the structure\ntheory of such algebras, paying special attention to a subclass of them that\ngives rise to maximal supersymmetry and that was the first to appear in this\ncontext: 3-Lie algebras.\n  In chapter 2, we review the structure theory of metric Lie algebras and their\nunitary representations. In chapter 3, we study metric 3-Leibniz algebras and\nshow, by specialising a construction originally due to Faulkner, that they are\nin one to one correspondence with pairs of real metric Lie algebras and unitary\nrepresentations of them. We also show a third characterisation for six extreme\ncases of 3-Leibniz algebras as graded Lie (super)algebras. In chapter 4, we\nstudy metric 3-Lie algebras in detail. We prove a structural result and also\nclassify those with a maximally isotropic centre, which is the requirement that\nensures unitarity of the corresponding conformal field theory. Finally, in\nchapter 5, we study the universal structure of superpotentials in this class of\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theories with matter in three dimensions. We\nprovide a uniform formulation for all these theories and establish the\nconnection between the amount of supersymmetry preserved and the gauge Lie\nalgebra and the appropriate unitary representation to be used to write down the\nLagrangian. The conditions for supersymmetry enhancement are then expressed\nequivalently in the language of representation theory of Lie algebras or the\nlanguage of 3-Leibniz algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 20:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

PSO technique is dramatically different with the genetic\nalgorithm and has apparently avoided the use of evolution operators (e.g.,\ncrossover and mutation). The approach is based on a highly efficient global\nminimization of free energy surfaces merging total-energy calculations via PSO\ntechnique and requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to\npredict stable or metastable structures at given external conditions (e.g.,\npressure). A particularly devised geometrical structure factor method which\nallows the elimination of similar structures during structure evolution was\nimplemented to enhance the structure search efficiency. The application of\ndesigned variable unit cell size technique has greatly reduced the\ncomputational cost. Moreover, the symmetry constraint imposed in the structure\ngeneration enables the realization of diverse structures, leads to\nsignificantly reduced search space and optimization variables, and thus fastens\nthe global structural convergence.

The resulting rates region is denoted crystallized rates region.\nBy treating the interference as noise, the n-user rates region frontiers has\nbeen found in the literature to be the convex hull of n hyper-surfaces. The\nrates region bounded by these hyper-surfaces is not necessarily convex, and\nthereby a convex hull operation is imposed through the strategy of\ntime-sharing. This paper simplifies this rates region in the n-dimensional\nspace by having only an On/Off binary power control. This consequently leads to\n2^n-1 corner points situated within the rates region. A time-sharing convex\nhull is imposed onto those corner points, forming the crystallized rates\nregion. The paper focuses on game theoretic concepts to achieve that\ncrystallized convex hull via correlated equilibrium. In game theory, the\ncorrelated equilibrium set is convex, and it consists of the time-sharing mixed\nstrategies of the Nash equilibriums. In addition, the paper considers a\nmechanism design approach to carefully design a utility function, particularly\nthe Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction utility, where the solution point is situated\non the correlated equilibrium set. Finally, the paper proposes a self learning\nalgorithm, namely the regret-matching algorithm, that converges to the solution\npoint on the correlated equilibrium set in a distributed fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 06:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

This method is sensitive mainly to the magnetic field in the bright\nregions of the stellar surface. The dark (spotted) regions are censored because\nthe Zeeman signature there is suppressed.

Its\nrealization is geared by the fundamental goal of effective management of demand\nload. In this work, we envision a scenario with real-time communication between\nthe operator and consumers. The grid operator controller receives requests for\npower demands from consumers, with different power requirement, duration, and a\ndeadline by which it is to be completed. The objective is to devise a power\ndemand task scheduling policy that minimizes the grid operational cost over a\ntime horizon. The operational cost is a convex function of instantaneous power\nconsumption and reflects the fact that each additional unit of power needed to\nserve demands is more expensive as demand load increases.First, we study the\noff-line demand scheduling problem, where parameters are fixed and known. Next,\nwe devise a stochastic model for the case when demands are generated\ncontinually and scheduling decisions are taken online and focus on long-term\naverage cost. We present two instances of power consumption control based on\nobserving current consumption. First, the controller may choose to serve a new\ndemand request upon arrival or to postpone it to the end of its deadline.\nSecond, the additional option exists to activate one of the postponed demands\nwhen an active demand terminates. For both instances, the optimal policies are\nthreshold based. We derive a lower performance bound over all policies, which\nis asymptotically tight as deadlines increase. We propose the Controlled\nRelease threshold policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal. The policy\nactivates a new demand request if the current power consumption is less than a\nthreshold, otherwise it is queued. Queued demands are scheduled when their\ndeadline expires or when the consumption drops below the threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 08:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

The dS0s in UV CMRs follow a steeper sequence than dEs and show\nbluer UV-optical color at a given magnitude. We also find that the UV CMRs of\ndEs in the outer cluster region are slightly steeper than that of their\ncounterparts in the inner region, due to the existence of faint, blue dEs in\nthe outer region. We explore the observed CMRs with population models of a\nluminosity-dependent delayed exponential star formation history. We confirm\nthat the feature of delayed star formation of early-type dwarf galaxies in\nVirgo cluster is strongly correlated with their morphology and environment. The\nobserved CMR of dS0s is well matched by models with relatively long delayed\nstar formation. Our results suggest that dS0s are most likely transitional\nobjects at the stage of subsequent transformation of late-type progenitors to\nordinary red dEs in the cluster environment. In any case, UV photometry\nprovides a powerful tool to disentangle the diverse subpopulations of\nearly-type dwarf galaxies and uncover their evolutionary histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 10:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This paper analyzes the sum throughput of a multiuser cognitive\nradio system with multi-antenna base stations, either in the uplink or downlink\nmode. The primary and secondary have $N$ and $n$ users, respectively, and their\nbase stations have $M$ and $m$ antennas, respectively. We show that an uplink\nsecondary throughput grows with $\\frac{m}{N +1}\\log n$ if the primary is a\ndownlink system, and grows with $\\frac{m}{M +1}\\log n$ if the primary is an\nuplink system. These growth rates are shown to be optimal and can be obtained\nwith a simple threshold-based user selection rule. Furthermore, we show that\nthe secondary throughput can grow proportional to $\\log n$ while simultaneously\npushing the interference on the primary down to zero, asymptotically.\nFurthermore, we show that a downlink secondary throughput grows with $m\\log\n\\log n$ in the presence of either an uplink or downlink primary system. In\naddition, the interference on the primary can be made to go to zero\nasymptotically while the secondary throughput increases proportionally to $\\log\n\\log n$. Thus, unlike the point-to-point case, multiuser cognitive radios can\nachieve non-trivial sum throughput despite stringent primary interference\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 15:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}
