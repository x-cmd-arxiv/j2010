The 2-flavour\ntheory is a candidate Walking Technicolor theory. Since we are attempting to\ndistinguish whether this theory is walking or conformal, we also study the\n3-flavour theory, which is believed to be conformal, for comparison. We\nsimulate lattice QCD with 2 and 3 flavours of colour-sextet staggered quarks at\nfinite temperatures to determine the scales of confinement and chiral-symmetry\nbreaking from the positions of the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry\nrestoration transitions. Unlike the case with fundamental quarks, these\ntransitions are far apart. For 2 flavours the values of beta=6/g^2 for both\ntransitions increase as Ta is decreased from 1/4 to 1/6 to 1/8, as expected for\na theory whose coupling runs to smaller values as the lattice spacing is\ndecreased. However, for the chiral transition, the increase in beta between\nTa=1/4 and Ta=1/6 is much larger than the increase between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8.\nThis suggests that between Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 we are at strong coupling where\nthe theory is effectively quenched, while between Ta=1/6 and Ta=1/8 we are\nemerging into the weak coupling regime. It will require even smaller Ta values\nto determine whether the running of the chiral-transition coupling is\ncontrolled by asymptotic freedom and the theory walks, or if it reaches a\nnon-zero limit when the transition becomes a bulk transition and the theory is\nconformal. The 3 flavour case at Ta=1/4 and Ta=1/6 behaves similarly to the 2\nflavour case. Since this theory is expected to be conformal, the interpretation\nthat we are seeing strong-coupling behaviour, inaccessible from the\nweak-coupling limit (continuum) is the most likely interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2010 19:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

The first\npart is devoted to the study of the inner flow. CAD and CFD software are used\nin order to determine the most important parameters of the flow at the exit of\nnozzle. An important conclusion is the existence of two flow regions: one in\nrelatively slow motion (the boundary layer) and a second nearly in solid\nrotation at a very high angular rate (about 100 000 rad/s) with a thickness of\nabout 4/5th of the nozzle section. Then, a theoretical and experimental\nanalysis of the flow outside the nozzle is carried out. In the theoretical\nsection, the size of the biggest drops is successfully compared to results\nstemming from linear instability theory. However, it is also shown that this\ntheory cannot explain the occurrence of small drops observed in the stability\ndomain whose size are close to the Kolmogorov and Taylor turbulent length\nscale. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyser (PDPA) is used to characterize the\ndroplet size and velocity distribution. Due to centrifugal force, the smaller\ndroplets tend to prevail on the spray axis and a peak close to the Taylor\nlength scale appears progressively in the PDF when increasing the distance from\nthe nozzle. It is then assumed that these small droplets are the results of a\nturbulent cascading atomization process and that in the near nozzle area, since\ncentrifugal segregation is small, PDF can therefore be fitted with a log-stable\nlaw (Rimbert and S\\'ero-Guillaume, 2004). The value of the stability index is\nfound to be 1.35 very close to a previous experimental result of 1.39 (Rimbert\nand Delconte, 2007) but far from a known theoretical value of 1.70 (Rimbert,\n2010).

Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from\nstrong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on\nthe water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We\nuse a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision\nof the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has\nbeen performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.\nWe are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star\nradius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the\ntransit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with\ntransmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations\nat the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:\nR_p/R_\\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and\na/R_\\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three\ntimes more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they\nbenefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic\nerrors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for\nstellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration\nphotometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio\ncorrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous\nmeasurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss\nthat water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius\nmeasured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is\naffected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2010 21:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It is argued that all the types of\nabove ordered phases in these systems follow from strong Coulomb interactions\nas a result of certain compromise between competing instabilities towards\nvarious types of magnetic order and optimize the gain of kinetic energy in\ndoped systems.

This enables us to introduce the notion of\nquantum object. 2) Classical systems are defined as macroscopic quantum objects\nin states close to maximum entropy. For classical mechanics, new states of such\nkind are introduced, the so-called maximum-entropy packets, and shown to\napproximate classical dynamics better than Gaussian wave packets. 3) A new\nsolution of quantum measurement problem is proposed for measurements that are\nperformed on microsystems. First, it is assumed that readings of registration\napparatuses are always signals from detectors. This implies restrictions on\nwhat is observable. Second, an application of the cluster separability\nprinciple leads to the key notion of the paper: the separation status of\nmicrosystems. The processes of preparation and registration include changes of\nseparation status. A crucial observation is that standard quantum mechanics\ndoes not prescribe the evolution during such changes.

Assuming no evolutionary effect in AGNs' spectral\nproperties, together with the independent estimates of $L_{\\rm 2-10keV}$, the\nbolometric correction, Eddington ratio, and black hole (BH) mass can all be\nestimated from these correlations for high-redshift AGNs, with the mean\nuncertainty of a factor of 2-3. If there are independent estimates of BH\nmasses, \\ga~ for high-redshift AGNs can be used to determine their true \\lb~\nand $L_{\\rm 2-10keV}$, and in conjunction with the redshift, can be potentially\nused to place constraints on cosmology by comparison with the rest-frame 2-10\nkeV flux. We find that the true $L_{\\rm 2-10keV}$ estimated from \\ga~ for the\nbrightest Type I AGNs with $z<1$ in the Lockman Hole is generally in agreement\nwith the observed $L_{\\rm 2-10keV}$.\n  However, there are still many uncertainties, such as the accurate\ndetermination of the intrinsic \\ga~ for distant AGNs and the large uncertainty\nin the luminosities obtained, which call for significant further study before\n``AGN cosmology'' can be considered a viable technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2010 15:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 02:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

What is usually the subject of science\nfiction is here proposed as a scientific theory open to empirical evaluation.\nWe know from physics how the world behaves, and from computing how information\nbehaves, so whether the physical world arises from ongoing information\nprocessing is a question science can evaluate. A prima facie case for the\nvirtual reality conjecture is presented. If a photon is a pixel on a\nmulti-dimensional grid that gives rise to space, the speed of light could\nreflect its refresh rate. If mass, charge and energy all arise from processing,\nthe many conservation laws of physics could reduce to a single law of dynamic\ninformation conservation. If the universe is a virtual reality, then its big\nbang creation could be simply when the system was booted up. Deriving core\nphysics from information processing could reconcile relativity and quantum\ntheory, with the former how processing creates the space-time operating system\nand the latter how it creates energy and matter applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2010 05:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}
