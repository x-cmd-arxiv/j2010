How can the appearance of the twisted wires be so perfectly\nrepetitive?

In theory peer review works if the involved parties (editors and\nreferees) conform to a set of requirements, such as love for high quality\nscience, objectiveness, and absence of biases, nepotism, friend and clique\nnetworks, selfishness, etc. If these requirements are violated, what is the\neffect on the selection of high quality work?

Companionship is confirmed\nfrom their statistically consistent proper motions and radial velocities, as\nwell as a chance alignment probability of only 0.08%. Like TWA 30A, the\nspectrum of TWA 30B shows signatures of an actively accreting disk (H I and\nalkali line emission) and forbidden emission lines tracing outflowing material\n([O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], and [N II]).

Negligible radial velocity shifts in the emission\nlines relative to the stellar frame of rest (Delta V < 30 km/s) indicate that\nthe outflows are viewed in the plane of the sky and that the corresponding\ncircumstellar disk is viewed edge-on.

Collaborative spectrum sensing\namong the cognitive radio nodes is expected to improve the ability of checking\ncomplete spectrum usage. Due to hardware limitations, each cognitive radio node\ncan only sense a relatively narrow band of radio spectrum. Consequently, the\navailable channel sensing information is far from being sufficient for\nprecisely recognizing the wide range of unoccupied channels. Aiming at breaking\nthis bottleneck, we propose to apply matrix completion and joint sparsity\nrecovery to reduce sensing and transmitting requirements and improve sensing\nresults. Specifically, equipped with a frequency selective filter, each\ncognitive radio node senses linear combinations of multiple channel information\nand reports them to the fusion center, where occupied channels are then decoded\nfrom the reports by using novel matrix completion and joint sparsity recovery\nalgorithms. As a result, the number of reports sent from the CRs to the fusion\ncenter is significantly reduced. We propose two decoding approaches, one based\non matrix completion and the other based on joint sparsity recovery, both of\nwhich allow exact recovery from incomplete reports. The numerical results\nvalidate the effectiveness and robustness of our approaches. In particular, in\nsmall-scale networks, the matrix completion approach achieves exact channel\ndetection with a number of samples no more than 50% of the number of channels\nin the network, while joint sparsity recovery achieves similar performance in\nlarge-scale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 19:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

No significant spectral variability was observed over the 626 s\nperiod. We have investigated the possibility that the 626 s period is orbital\nin nature (either that of an ultra-compact X-ray binary or an AM CVn) or\nrelated to the spin of a compact object (either an accretion powered pulsar or\nan intermediate polar). The X-ray properties of the source and the photometry\nof the candidate near-infrared counterparts are consistent with an accreting\nneutron star X-ray binary on the near-side of the Galactic bulge, where the 626\ns period is most likely indicative of the pulsar spin period.

In this paper, hadronic event shapes are examined with\nSoft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) by expanding around the dijet limit. A\nsimple event shape, threshold thrust, is defined. This observable is global and\nhas no free parameters, making it ideal for clarifying how resummation of\nhadronic event shapes can be done in SCET. Threshold thrust is calculated at\nnext-to-leading fixed order (NLO) in SCET and resummed to\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL).

Although threshold thrust is not\nitself expected to be phenomenologically interesting, it can be modified into a\nrelated observable which allows the jet pT distribution to be calculated and\nresummed to NNLL+NLO accuracy.

Unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated for\ncertain stellar evolution stages. Of particular concern is the treatment of the\nthermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase, as different\nimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.\nPost-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as TP-AGB stars are\nthought to be most prominently visible during this phase.

The available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous and\nwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7<z<2.0, from which we\nconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (SED) over the\nrange 1200-40 000 Angstrom.

Whether this is\ndue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dust\nobscuration of TP-AGB stars remains to be addressed.

While awaiting the resolution of the pseudogap problem in\ncuprates, we demonstrate that local pairing fluctuations, vortex liquid\ndynamics and other precursor phenomena can emerge quite generally whenever\nfermionic excitations remain gapped across the superconducting transition,\nregardless of the gap origin. Our choice of a tractable model is a lattice band\ninsulator with short-range attractive interactions between fermions in the\ns-wave channel. An effective crossover between Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nand Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) regimes can be identified in any band\ninsulator above two dimensions, while in two dimensions only the BEC regime\nexists. The superconducting transition is \"unconventional\" (non-pair-breaking)\nin the BEC regime, identified by either the bosonic mean-field or XY\nuniversality class. The insulator adjacent to the superconductor in the BEC\nregime is a bosonic Mott insulator of Cooper pairs, which may be susceptible to\ncharge density wave ordering. We construct a function of the many-body\nexcitation spectrum whose non-analytic changes define a sharp distinction\nbetween band and Mott insulators.

To assist in\nexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,\nwe describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a \"blend\"\nrather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or\nforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated\nby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric\naperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9, a target harboring two\npreviously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c) showing\ntransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-day\nperiod suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER\ntogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule\nout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validation\nof their planetary nature. For the shallower signal we rule out a large\nfraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm\nrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown\nfrequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this\nfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due\nto a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than a\nfalse positive.

In this paper, we study the fundamental\nclass of linear-invariant properties called matroid freeness properties. These\nproperties have been conjectured to essentially coincide with all testable\nlinear-invariant properties, and a recent sequence of works has established\ntestability for increasingly larger subclasses. One question left open,\nhowever, is whether the infinitely many syntactically different properties\nrecently shown testable in fact correspond to new, semantically distinct ones.\nThis is a crucial issue since it has also been shown that there exist\nsubclasses of these properties for which an infinite set of syntactically\ndifferent representations collapse into one of a small, finite set of\nproperties, all previously known to be testable.\n  An important question is therefore to understand the semantics of matroid\nfreeness properties, and in particular when two syntactically different\nproperties are truly distinct. We shed light on this problem by developing a\nmethod for determining the relation between two matroid freeness properties P\nand Q. Furthermore, we show that there is a natural subclass of matroid\nfreeness properties such that for any two properties P and Q from this\nsubclass, a strong dichotomy must hold: either P is contained in Q or the two\nproperties are \"well separated.\" As an application of this method, we exhibit\nnew, infinite hierarchies of testable matroid freeness properties such that at\neach level of the hierarchy, there are functions that are far from all\nfunctions lying in lower levels of the hierarchy.

We first formulate the dynamic scheduling problem as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the users' heterogeneous\nmultimedia data characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines, distortion impacts and\ndependencies etc.) and time-varying channel conditions, which are not\nsimultaneously considered in state-of-the-art packet scheduling algorithms.\nThis formulation allows us to perform foresighted decisions to schedule\nmultiple data units for transmission at each time in order to optimize the\nlong-term utilities of the multimedia applications. The heterogeneity of the\nmedia data enables us to express the transmission priorities between the\ndifferent data units as a priority graph, which is a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG). This priority graph provides us with an elegant structure to decompose\nthe multi-data unit foresighted decision at each time into multiple single-data\nunit foresighted decisions which can be performed sequentially, from the high\npriority data units to the low priority data units, thereby significantly\nreducing the computation complexity. When the statistical knowledge of the\nmultimedia data characteristics and channel conditions is unknown a priori, we\ndevelop a low-complexity online learning algorithm to update the value\nfunctions which capture the impact of the current decision on the future\nutility. The simulation results show that the proposed solution significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art scheduling solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 23:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-27"}

When\nconsidering the STAP system deployed with conformal radar array (CFA), the\ntraining data are range-dependent, which results in poor detection performance\nof traditional statistical-based algorithms. Current registration-based\ncompensation (RBC) is implemented based on a sub-snapshot spectrum using\ntemporal smoothing. In this case, the estimation accuracy of the configuration\nparameters and the clutter power distribution is limited. In this paper, the\ntechnique of sparse representation is introduced into the spectral estimation,\nand a new compensation method is proposed, namely RBC with sparse\nrepresentation (SR-RBC). This method first converts the clutter spectral\nestimation into an ill-posed problem with the constraint of sparsity. Then, the\ntechnique of sparse representation, like iterative reweighted least squares\n(IRLS), is utilized to solve this problem. Then, the transform matrix is\ndesigned so that the processed training data behaves nearly stationary with the\ntest cell. Because the configuration parameters and the clutter spectral\nresponse are obtained with full-snapshot using sparse representation, SR-RBC\nprovides more accurate clutter spectral estimation, and the transformed\ntraining data are more stationary so that better signal-clutter-ratio (SCR)\nimprovement is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 01:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 12:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

Disentangling the contribution of each\nof those putative dust-heating agents is a challenging task, and direct imaging\nof the innermost few pc can only be accomplished at radio wavelengths, using\nvery high-angular resolution observations. Aims: We observed the nucleus A of\nthe interacting starburst galaxy Arp 299, using very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) radio observations at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz. Our aim was to\ncharacterize the compact sources in the innermost few pc region of Arp 299-A,\nas well as to detect recently exploded core-collapse supernovae. Methods: We\nused the European VLBI Network (EVN) to image the 1.7 and 5.0 GHz compact radio\nemission of the parsec-scale structure in the nucleus of Arp 299-A with\nmilliarcsecond resolution. Results: Our EVN observations show that one of the\ncompact VLBI sources, A1, previously detected at 5.0 GHz, has a flat spectrum\nbetween 1.7 and 5.0 GHz and is the brightest source at both frequencies. Our\n1.7 GHz EVN image shows also diffuse, low-surface brightness emission extending\nwestwards from A1 and displays a prominent core-jet structure. Conclusions: The\nmorphology, radio luminosity, spectral index and ratio of radio-to-X-ray\nemission of the A1-A5 region is consistent with a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN),\nand rules out the possibility that it is a chain of young radio supernovae\n(RSNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We therefore conclude that A1-A5 is the\nlong-sought AGN in Arp 299-A.

We observed with FORS1 at the ESO-VLT\n42 Blazars with an emission redshift 0.8<z_em<1.9, to which we added the three\nhigh z northern objects belonging to the 1Jy BL Lac sample. We detect 32 MgII\nabsorbers in the redshift range 0.35-1.45, leading to an excess in the\nincidence of MgII absorbers compared to that measured towards QSOs by a factor\n~2, detected at 3 sigma. The amplitude of the effect is similar to that found\nalong GRB sightlines. Our analysis provides a new piece of evidence that the\nobserved incidence of MgII absorbers might depend on the type of background\nsource.

These fringes are due to an\ninterference phenomenon occurring from straylight effects inside an\ninterferometric instrument. We developed an analytical approach to better\nunderstand this phenomenon when straylight causes crosstalk between beams.\n  We deduced that the parasitic interference significantly affects the\ninterferometric phase and thus the associated observables including the\ndifferential phase and the closure phase. The amount of parasitic flux coupled\nto the piston between beams appears to be very influential in this degradation.\nFor instance, considering a point-like source and a piston ranging from\n$\\lambda/500$ to $\\lambda/5$ in L band ($\\lambda=3.5\\:\\mu$m), a parasitic flux\nof about 1\\% of the total flux produces a parasitic phase reaching at most one\nthird of the intrinsic phase. The piston, which can have different origins\n(instrumental stability, atmospheric perturbations, ...), thus amplifies the\neffect of parasitic interference.\n  According to specifications of piston correction in space or at ground level\n(respectively $\\lambda/500\\approx 2$nm and $\\lambda/30\\approx 100$nm), the\ndetection of hot Jupiter-like planets, one of the most challenging aims for\ncurrent ground-based interferometers, limits parasitic radiation to about 5\\%\nof the incident intensity. This was evaluated by considering different types of\nhot Jupiter synthetic spectra.\n  Otherwise, if no fringe tracking is used, the detection of a typical hot\nJupiter-like system with a solar-like star would admit a maximum level of\nparasitic intensity of 0.01\\% for piston errors equal to $\\lambda$/15. If the\nfringe tracking specifications are not precisely observed, it thus appears that\nthe allowed level of parasitic intensity dramatically decreases and may prevent\nthe detection. In parallel, the calibration of the parasitic phase by a\nreference star, at this accuracy level, seems very difficult. Moreover, since\nparasitic phase is an object-dependent quantity, the use of a hypothetical\nphase abacus, directly giving the parasitic phase from a given parasitic flux\nlevel, is also impossible. Some instrumental solutions, implemented at the\ninstrument design stage for limiting or preventing this parasitic interference,\nappears to be crucial and are presented in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 11:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-27"}

In the model, the QPC is\nconsidered as a saddle point of two-dimensional potential landscape. The SOI\nacts within a finite region and is absent deep in the reservoirs. The SOI\nstrength is not supposed to be strong. It is shown that the spin polarization\nappears in the third order of the perturbation theory as a result of definite\ncombinations of electron transitions. They include two intersubband transitions\nto nearest subbands and one intrasubband transition. The spin current is\nproportional to the cube of the SOI strength and strongly depends on geometric\nparameters of the saddle point. The spin is polarized in the plane of the QPC\nand directed normally to the electron current if the SOI is of Rashba type. As\na function of the saddle-point potential (i.e., the height of the QPC barrier),\nthe spin conductance and especially the spin polarization have characteristic\nfeatures (specifically, peaks) correlated with the charge conductance\nquantization steps. The peak shape depends on the length of the region where\nthe SOI acts. In QPCs with sharp potential landscape, this picture is distorted\nby interference processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 12:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

The\nflow equations for a Bose gas are derived in a scheme which treats the\ntwo-particle density-density correlations exactly but neglects irreducible\ncorrelations among three and more particles. These flow equations are solved\nwithin a truncation which allows to extract the complete frequency and momentum\nstructure of the normal and anomalous self-energies. Both the asymptotic small\nmomentum regime, where perturbation regime fails, as well as the perturbative\nregime at larger momenta are well described within a single unified approach.\nThe self-energies do not exhibit any infrared divergences, satisfy the U(1)\nsymmetry constraints, and are in accordance with the Nepomnyashchy relation\nwhich states that the anomalous self-energy vanishes at zero momentum and zero\nfrequency. From the self-energies we extract the single-particle spectral\ndensity of the two-dimensional Bose gas.

This is\nappropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard\nfixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this\nscheme.\n  Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about\nhow they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the\nfollowing question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from\ndata in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first\ncase. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly\nwhen the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending\nfixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T\noutcomes. We show, however, that no such slowdown is necessary if the experts\nare hidden Markov models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 15:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-27"}
