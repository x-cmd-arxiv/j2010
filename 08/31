Surprisingly, in the same\ncharge state, but under different gate-configurations, the splitting does not\ndisappear for any value of the magnetic field, but we observe an avoided\ncrossing of two high-conductance lines. We think that our observations can be\nunderstood in terms of a two-impurity Kondo effect with two spins coupled\nantiferromagnetically. The exchange coupling between the two spins can be\ninfluenced by a local gate, and the non-recovery of the Kondo resonance for\ncertain gate configurations is explained by the existence of a small\nantisymmetric contribution to the exchange interaction between the two spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 16:02:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2011 16:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-01"}

The main cost of many QMC methods, for example the\nvariational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, is in constructing a sequence of Slater\nmatrices and computing the ratios of determinants for successive Slater\nmatrices. Recent work has improved the scaling of constructing Slater matrices\nfor insulators so that the cost of constructing Slater matrices in these\nsystems is now linear in the number of particles, whereas computing determinant\nratios remains cubic in the number of particles. With the long term aim of\nsimulating much larger systems, we improve the scaling of computing the\ndeterminant ratios in the VMC method for simulating insulators by using\npreconditioned iterative solvers.\n  The main contribution of this paper is the development of a method to\nefficiently compute for the Slater matrices a sequence of preconditioners that\nmake the iterative solver converge rapidly. This involves cheap preconditioner\nupdates, an effective reordering strategy, and a cheap method to monitor\ninstability of ILUTP preconditioners. Using the resulting preconditioned\niterative solvers to compute determinant ratios of consecutive Slater matrices\nreduces the scaling of QMC algorithms from O(n^3) per sweep to roughly O(n^2),\nwhere n is the number of particles, and a sweep is a sequence of n steps, each\nattempting to move a distinct particle. We demonstrate experimentally that we\ncan achieve the improved scaling without increasing statistical errors. Our\nresults show that preconditioned iterative solvers can dramatically reduce the\ncost of VMC for large(r) systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 16:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2011 02:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

Our results\nconfirm earlier work regarding the influence of mergers on the mass density\nprofile and the inside-out growth of halos. The inner regions that contain the\nvisible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affected\nonly by major mergers. Particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers are\nfound predominantly in the outskirts of halos. Our analysis reveals trends that\nrun counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. For example,\nmajor mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)\ncontribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20\nper cent for our six Aquarius halos. The bulk is contributed roughly equally by\nminor mergers and by \"diffuse\" material which is not resolved into individual\nobjects. This is consistent with modeling based on excursion-set theory which\nsuggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a halo\nof any scale. Interestingly, the simulations themselves suggest that a\nsignificantly fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlier\nhalos by mergers prior to their joining the main system. The Aquarius\nsimulations resolve halos to much lower mass scales than are expected to retain\ngas or form stars. These results thus confirm that most of the baryons from\nwhich visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than through\nmergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affect\ngalaxy structure at later times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 16:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 11:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We\nalso address the problem of interpretation of the moments and shapes of the LSD\nprofiles in terms of physical parameters. We have developed an improved,\nmultiprofile version of LSD and have extended the deconvolution procedure to\nlinear polarization analysis taking into account anomalous Zeeman splitting of\nspectral lines. This code is applied to the theoretical Stokes parameter\nspectra. We test various methods of interpreting the mean profiles,\ninvestigating how coarse approximations of the multiline technique translate\ninto errors of the derived parameters. We find that, generally, the Stokes\nparameter LSD profiles do not behave as a real spectral line with respect to\nthe variation of magnetic field and elemental abundance. This problem is\nespecially prominent for the Stokes I variation with abundance and Stokes Q\nvariation with magnetic field. At the same time, the Stokes V LSD spectra\nclosely resemble profile of a properly chosen synthetic line for the magnetic\nfield strength up to 1 kG. We conclude that the usual method of interpreting\nthe LSD profiles by assuming that they are equivalent to a real spectral line\ngives satisfactory results only in a limited parameter range and thus should be\napplied with caution.

In the presence of singlet kinetic\nmixing, the hidden sector automatically acquires a light mass scale in the\nrange 0.1 - 100 GeV induced by electroweak symmetry breaking. In theories with\nR-parity conservation, superparticles produced at the LHC invariably cascade\ndecay into hidden sector particles. Since the hidden sector singlet couples to\nthe visible sector via the Higgs sector, these cascades necessarily produce a\nHiggs boson in an order 0.01 - 1 fraction of events.

In this case, the derived magnetic field is B ~ 5 microGauss, the\nminimum electron energy is 7-40 m_e c^2, and the Doppler factor is delta ~ 8 in\na knot 8\" from the nucleus. The minimum total kinetic power of the jet is\n1-2E45 erg/s. Upstream of the bend, the width of the X-ray emission in the jet\nis about half the projected distance from the nucleus. This implies that the\nhighly relativistic bulk motion is not limited to an extremely thin spine, as\nhas been proposed previously for FR 1 sources. The bending of the jet, the\ndeceleration of the flow from parsec to kiloparsec scales, and the knotty\nstructure can all be caused by standing shocks inclined by ~7 degrees to the\njet axis. Moving shocks resulting from major changes in the flow properties can\nalso reproduce the knotty structure, but such a model does not explain as many\nof the observational details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 22:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 19:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

First, the error-correcting capabilities of\nintra-session network coding make our scheme resilient to loss. Second,\nredundancy allows intermediate nodes to operate without knowledge of the\ndecoding buffers of their neighbors. Based only on the knowledge of the loss\nrates on the direct and overhearing links, intermediate nodes can make\ndecisions for both intra-session (i.e., how much redundancy to add in each\nflow) and inter-session (i.e., what percentage of flows to code together)\ncoding.

The equivalence was established by Sokolov in the\ncontext of proving that the equivalence holds for models that satisfy cluster\nseparability. The generalized Bakamjian Thomas construction is used in most\napplications, even though it only satisfies cluster properties for systems of\nless than four particles. Different forms of dynamics are related by unitary\ntransformations that remove interactions from some infinitesimal generators and\nintroduce them to other generators. These unitary transformation must be\ninteraction dependent, because they can be applied to a non-interacting\ngenerator and produce an interacting generator. This suggests that these\ntransformations can generate complex many-body forces when used in many-body\nproblems. It turns out that this is not the case. In all cases of interest the\nresult of applying the unitary scattering equivalence results in\nrepresentations that have simple relations, even though the unitary\ntransformations are dynamical. This applies to many-body models as well as\nmodels with particle production. In all cases no new many-body operators are\ngenerated by the unitary scattering equivalences relating the different forms\nof dynamics. This makes it clear that the various calculations used in\napplications that emphasize one form of the dynamics over another are\nequivalent. Furthermore, explicit representations of the equivalent dynamical\nmodels in any form of dynamics are easily constructed. Where differences do\nappear is when electromagnetic probes are treated in the one-photon exchange\napproximation. This approximation is different in each of Dirac's forms of\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 05:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The simulations show that\ndensity profiles with flat cores produce hundreds of low-mass stars, either\ndistributed throughout the entire cloud or found in subclusters, depending on\nthe initial turbulence. Concentrated density profiles always lead to the\nformation of one high-mass star in the centre of the cloud and, if at all,\nlow-mass stars surrounding the central one.

We show that this interpretation is not unique. We focus instead\non the ubiquitous faint upflows, associated with blue asymmetries of spectral\nline profiles in footpoint regions of coronal loops, and as faint disturbances\npropagating along coronal loops in EUV/XR imaging timeseries. The two scenarios\nare difficult to differentiate using only imaging data, but careful analysis of\nspectral line profiles indicates that faint upflows are likely responsible for\nsome of the observed quasi-periodic oscillatory signals in the corona. We show\nthat EIS measurements of intensity and velocity oscillations in coronal lines\n(previously interpreted as direct evidence for propagating waves) are actually\naccompanied by significant oscillations in the line width that are driven by a\nquasi-periodically varying component of emission in the blue wing of the line.\nThe faint blue-shifted emission component quasi-periodically modulates the peak\nintensity and line-centroid of a single Gaussian fit to the profile with the\nsame small amplitudes (respectively a few percent of background intensity, and\na few km/s) used to infer the presence of MA waves. Our results indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers\nand spectrographs, previously interpreted as propagating MA waves, are caused\nby these upflows. The different physical cause for coronal oscillations would\nsignificantly impact the prospects of successful coronal seismology using\npropagating disturbances in coronal loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 12:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The main\nemphasis is placed on the response of electronic excitations in the\nantiferromagnetic phase, in the pseudogap range, in the superconducting state,\nand in the essentially normal metallic state at $x \\ge 0.26$, where no\nsuperconductivity could be observed. In most of the cases we compare B$_{1g}$\nand B$_{2g}$ spectra which project out electronic properties close to $(\\pi,0)$\nand $(\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, respectively. In the channel of electron-hole excitations\nwe find universal behavior in B$_{2g}$ symmetry as long as the material\nexhibits superconductivity at low temperature. In contrast, there is a strong\ndoping dependence in B$_{1g}$ symmetry: (i) In the doping range $0.20 \\le p \\le\n0.25$ we observe rapid changes of shape and temperature dependence of the\nspectra. (ii) In La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ new structures appear for $x < 0.13$\nwhich are superposed on the electron-hole continuum. The temperature dependence\nas well as model calculations support an interpretation in terms of\ncharge-ordering fluctuations. For $x \\le 0.05$ the response from fluctuations\ndisappears at B$_{1g}$ and appears at B$_{2g}$ symmetry in full agreement with\nthe orientation change of stripes found by neutron scattering. While, with a\ngrain of salt, the particle-hole continuum is universal for all cuprates the\nresponse from fluctuating charge order in the range $0.05 \\le p < 0.16$ is so\nfar found only in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$. We conclude that\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ is close to static charge order and, for this reason,\nmay have a suppressed $T_c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 13:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The purpose of this paper is to establish the basis of reference\nfor the photo-z determination used in all our subsequent papers, including weak\nlensing tomography studies. This project is based on a sample of 91 high\nredshift (z>0.4), massive clusters with existing HST imaging, for which we are\npresently performing complementary multi-wavelength imaging. This allows us in\nparticular to estimate spectral types and determine accurate photometric\nredshifts for galaxies along the lines of sight to the first ten clusters for\nwhich all the required data are available down to a limit of I_AB=24/24.5 with\nthe LePhare software. The accuracy in redshift is of the order of 0.05 for the\nrange 0.2<z<1.5. We verified that the technique applied to obtain photometric\nredshifts works well by comparing our results to with previous works. In\nclusters, photoz accuracy is degraded for bright absolute magnitudes and for\nthe latest and earliest type galaxies. The photoz accuracy also only slightly\nvaries as a function of the spectral type for field galaxies. As a consequence,\nwe find evidence for an environmental dependence of the photoz accuracy,\ninterpreted as the standard used Spectral Energy Distributions being not very\nwell suited to cluster galaxies. Finally, we modeled the LCDCS 0504 mass with\nthe strong arcs detected along this line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 13:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

We compare them to (ion,$x$n$\n+ y$p) reactions with (ion=p,d,$\\alpha$) from particle accelerators like\ncyclotrons and (n,$\\gamma$) or (n,f) reactions from nuclear reactors. For\nphotonuclear reactions with a narrow $\\gamma$ beam the energy deposition in the\ntarget can be managed by using a stack of thin target foils or wires, hence\navoiding direct stopping of the Compton and pair electrons (positrons).\n$(\\gamma,\\gamma')$ isomer production via specially selected $\\gamma$ cascades\nallows to produce high specific activity in multiple excitations, where no\nback-pumping of the isomer to the ground state occurs. We discuss in detail\nmany specific radioisotopes for diagnostics and therapy applications.\nPhotonuclear reactions with $\\gamma$ beams allow to produce certain\nradioisotopes, e.g. $^{47}$Sc, $^{44}$Ti, $^{67}$Cu, $^{103}$Pd, $^{117m}$Sn,\n$^{169}$Er, $^{195m}$Pt or $^{225}$Ac, with higher specific activity and/or\nmore economically than with classical methods. This will open the way for\ncompletely new clinical applications of radioisotopes. For example $^{195m}$Pt\ncould be used to verify the patient's response to chemotherapy with platinum\ncompounds before a complete treatment is performed. Also innovative isotopes\nlike $^{47}$Sc, $^{67}$Cu and $^{225}$Ac could be produced for the first time\nin sufficient quantities for large-scale application in targeted radionuclide\ntherapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 14:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 07:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
