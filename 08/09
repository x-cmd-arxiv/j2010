To overcome the complexity of verification of real-time\nsystems with dense dynamics, Dutertre and Sorea, proposed timeout and calender\nbased transition systems to model the behavior of real-time systems and\nverified safety properties using k-induction in association with bounded model\nchecking. In this work, we introduce a specification formalism for these models\nin terms of Timeout Transition Diagrams and capture their behavior in terms of\nsemantics of Timed Transition Systems. Further, we discuss a technique, which\nreduces the problem of verification of qualitative temporal properties on\ninfinite state space of (a large fragment of) these timeout and calender based\ntransition systems into that on clockless finite state models through a\ntwo-step process comprising of digitization and canonical finitary reduction.\nThis technique enables us to verify safety invariants for real-time systems\nusing finite state model-checking avoiding the complexity of infinite state\n(bounded) model checking and scale up models without applying techniques from\ninduction based proof methodology. Moreover, we can verify liveness properties\nfor real-time systems, which is not possible by using induction with infinite\nstate model checkers. We present examples of Fischer's Protocol, Train-Gate\nController, and TTA start-up algorithm to illustrate how such an approach can\nbe efficiently used for verifying safety, liveness, and timeliness properties\nspecified in LTL using finite state model checkers like SAL-smc and Spin.

Strong parton energy loss has been observed in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield\nof high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in\np+p collisions. Moreover, measurements of back-to-back correlations of charged\nhadrons suggest that jet shapes are strongly modified modified by the medium.\nThe quantitative interpretation of single and di-hadron measurements is,\nhowever, complicated by the fact that the initial parton energy is unknown. A\nmore informative measurement would be one in which the initial parton energy is\nknown, allowing the determination of the fragmentation function, which may be\neffectively modified from its vacuum form by the presence of the medium. Two\nmeasurements in which the initial parton energy may be estimated are discussed\nin these proceedings: jet reconstruction and two- particle correlations using\ndirect photons. Jet reconstruction in nuclear collisions is challenging due to\nthe large background of soft particles, fluctuations of which give rise to fake\njets. Direct photons can be used to estimate the initial parton energy of the\nrecoil jet without recourse to jet reconstruction algorithms. However, such\nstudies suffer from a smaller rate and the direct photon signal must be\ndisentangled from a large background of decay photons. We present jet\nreconstruction results which use an algorithm suitable for a high multiplicity\nenvironment. We also present results of two-particle correlations using direct\nphotons. These results are discussed in the context of medium modification to\nthe fragmentation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2010 19:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Consider a 3-tuple (K, H1, H2) that K: H1 -> H2 is an\nintegral operator. Suppose a signal f in H1, {\\Omega}1 and {\\Omega}2 are\ndomains on which f, Kf define respectively. Does this signal f vanish if\n|{\\Sigma}(f)|<|{\\Omega}1|and|{\\Sigma}(Kf)|<|{\\Omega}2|? The excesses and\ndeficiencies of integral kernel K({\\omega}, t) are found to be greatly related\nto this general formulation of QUP. The complete point theory of integral\nkernel is so established to deal with the QUP. This theory addresses the\ndensity and linear independence of integral kernels. Some algebraic and\ngeometric properties of complete points are presented. It is shown that the\nsatisfaction of QUP depends on the existence of some complete points. By\nrecognizing complete points of their corresponding integral kernels, the QUP\nwith Fourier transform, Wigner-Ville distribution, Gabor transform and wavelet\nare studied. It is shown the QUP only holds for good behaved integral\noperators. An investigation of full violation of QUP shows that L2 space is\nlarge for high resolution harmonic analysis. And the invertible linear integral\ntransforms whose kernels are complete in L2 probably lead to the satisfaction\nof QUP. It indicates the performance limitation of linear integral transforms\nin harmonic analysis. Two possible ways bypassing uncertainty principle,\nnonlinear method and sparse representation, are thus suggested. The notion of\noperator family is developed and is applied to understand remarkable\nperformances of recent sparse representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 01:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-10"}

We show that the amplification\nof deviations in launch parameters from a one parameter family of solution\ncurves is quantified by the largest singular value of an appropriate Jacobian.\nThis allows us to predict a preferred throwing style in terms of this singular\nvalue, which itself depends on target location and the target shape.

Therefore, the\ngravity on large scales should be dominant by the distribution of dark matter\nin the universe. However, a series of observations incontrovertibly show that\nthe velocity and density fields of baryonic matter are decoupling from\nunderlying dark matter field. This paper shows our attemps to unveil the\nphysics behind this puzzle. In linear approximation, the dynamics of the baryon\nfluid is completely governed by the gravity of the dark matter. Consequently,\nthe mass density field of baryon matter $\\rho_b({\\bf r},t)$ will be\nproportional to that of dark matter $\\rho_{\\rm dm}({\\bf r},t)$, even though\nthey are different from each other initially. In weak and moderate nonlinear\nregime, the dynamics of the baryon fluid can be sketched by Burgers equation. A\nbasic feature of the Burgers dynamics is to yield shocks. When the Reynolds\nnumber is large, the Burgers fluid will be in the state of Burgers turbulence,\nwhich consists of shocks and complex structures. On the other hand, the\ncollisionless dark matter may not show such shock, but a multivalued velocity\nfield. Therefore, the weak and moderate nonlinear evolution leads to the\nIGM-dark matter deviation. Yet, the velocity field of Burgers fluid is still\nirrotational, as gravity is curl-free. In fully nonlinear regime, the vorticity\nof velocity field developed, and the cosmic baryonic fluid will no longer be\npotential, as the dynamics of vorticity is independent of gravity and can be\nself maintained by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics.

Time-dependent (TD-) DFT is a younger development which\nallows DFT concepts to be used to describe the temporal evolution of the\ndensity in the presence of a perturbing field. Linear response (LR) theory then\nallows spectra and other information about excited states to be extracted from\nTD-DFT. Once again the exact TD-DFT xc-functional must be approximated in\npractical calculations and this has historically been done using the TD-DFT\nadiabatic approximation (AA) which is to TD-DFT very much like what the local\ndensity approximation (LDA) is to conventional ground-state DFT.

The observed social\nnetwork is thus a byproduct of an expressive strategic interaction, which can\nmore naturally explain the emergence of complex social structures. Within this\nframework, we present a natural network formation game in which agent utilities\nare locally defined and that, despite its simplicity, produces a rich class of\nequilibria that exhibit structural properties commonly observed in social\nnetworks - such as triadic closure - that have proved elusive in most existing\nmodels.\n  Specifically, we consider a game in which players organize networking events\nat a cost that grows with the number of attendees. An event's cost is assumed\nby the organizer but the benefit accrues equally to all attendees: a link is\nformed between any two players who see each other at more than a certain number\nr of events per time period. The graph of connections so obtained is the social\nnetwork of the model.\n  We analyze the Nash equilibria of this game when each player derives a\nbenefit a>0 from all her neighbors in the network and when the costs are\nlinear, i.e., when the cost of an event with L invitees is b+cL, with b>0 and\nc>0. For a/cr > 1 and b sufficiently small, all Nash equilibria have the\ncomplete graph as their social network; for a/cr < 1 the Nash equilibria\ncorrespond to a rich class of social networks, all of which have substantial\nclustering in the sense that the clustering coefficient is bounded below by the\ninverse of the average degree. Additionally, for any degree sequence with\nfinite mean, and not too many vertices of degree one or two, we can construct a\nNash equilibrium producing a social network with the given degree sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 14:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-23"}

In the present paper, the\nnon-uniqueness of the factorization is exploited to derive new isospectral\nnon-singular potentials. Many one-parameter families of potentials can be\ngenerated from known potentials using a factorization that involves\nsuperpotentials defined in terms of excited states of a potential. For these\ncases an operator representation is available. If ladder operators are known\nfor the original potential, then a straightforward procedure exists for\ndefining such operators for its isospectral partners. The generality of the\nmethod is illustrated with a number of examples which may have many possible\napplications in atomic and molecular physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 15:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09"}

The separation between the condensations\nis between 1000 and 2100 AU, and their masses range from about 0.1 to 0.2\nM_sun. We find that the three condensations have extremely low bolometric\nluminosities (< 0.1 L_sun) and temperatures (< 20 K), indicating that these are\nyoung sources that have yet to form protostars. We suggest that these sources\nwere formed through the fragmentation of an elongated prestellar core. Our\nresults, in concert with other observed protostellar binary systems with\nseparations in the scale of 1000 AU, support the scenario that prompt\nfragmentation in the isothermal collapse phase is an efficient mechanism for\nwide binary star formation, while the fragmentation in the subsequent adiabatic\nphase may be an additional mechanism for close (< 100 AU) binary star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 15:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The particle-emitting sources undergo a\ncrossover transition from the QGP to hadronic gas. We take into account a usual\nshear viscosity for the strongly coupled QGP as well as the bulk viscosity\nwhich increases significantly in the crossover region. The two-pion\nHanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry for the viscous hydrodynamic sources\nis performed. The HBT analyses indicate that the viscosity effect on the\ntwo-pion HBT results is small if only the shear viscosity is taken into\nconsideration in the calculations. The bulk viscosity leads to a larger\ntransverse freeze-out configuration of the pion-emitting sources, and thus\nincreases the transverse HBT radii. The results of the longitudinal HBT radius\nfor the source with Bjorken longitudinal scaling are consistent with the\nexperimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 15:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 17:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 03:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
