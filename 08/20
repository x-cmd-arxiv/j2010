It is well known that for dispersive\nmedia this approach does not directly yield exact expressions for the energy\nand momentum densities. Although Maxwell's equations fully describe\nelectromagnetic fields, the general approach to conserved quantities in field\ntheory is not based on the field equations, but rather on the action. Here an\naction principle for macroscopic electromagnetism in dispersive, lossless media\nis used to derive the exact conserved energy-momentum tensor. The time-averaged\nenergy density reduces to Brillouin's simple formula when the fields are\nmonochromatic. The momentum density is not given by the familiar Minkowski\nexpression $\\mathbf{D}\\times\\mathbf{B}$, even for time-averaged monochromatic\nfields.

Therefore one relies on measures\nlike the p- or log-det distances, or makes explicit, and often simplistic,\nassumptions about sequence evolution. Information theory provides an\nalternative, in the form of mutual information (MI) which is, in principle, an\nobjective and model independent similarity measure. MI can be estimated by\nconcatenating and zipping sequences, yielding thereby the \"normalized\ncompression distance\". So far this has produced promising results, but with\nuncontrolled errors. We describe a simple approach to get robust estimates of\nMI from global pairwise alignments. Using standard alignment algorithms, this\ngives for animal mitochondrial DNA estimates that are strikingly close to\nestimates obtained from the alignment free methods mentioned above. Our main\nresult uses algorithmic (Kolmogorov) information theory, but we show that\nsimilar results can also be obtained from Shannon theory. Due to the fact that\nit is not additive, normalized compression distance is not an optimal metric\nfor phylogenetics, but we propose a simple modification that overcomes the\nissue of additivity. We test several versions of our MI based distance measures\non a large number of randomly chosen quartets and demonstrate that they all\nperform better than traditional measures like the Kimura or log-det (resp.\nparalinear) distances. Even a simplified version based on single letter Shannon\nentropies, which can be easily incorporated in existing software packages, gave\nsuperior results throughout the entire animal kingdom. But we see the main\nvirtue of our approach in a more general way. For example, it can also help to\njudge the relative merits of different alignment algorithms, by estimating the\nsignificance of specific alignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 17:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The orbits involved in this case are closed and long --- judged by\narc length between two points compared to the hyperbolic distance between them.\nUsing Ford circles of Farey sequences we find their lifts to the Standard\nFundamental Region (SFR) and find points of these lifts making given angles\nwith a horizontal. Next, we offer two algorithms, both involving continued\nfractions, of locating points whose angle with the horizontal is near any\ntarget angle and whose lifts are near any given point in the SFR.\n  Next, we study the homotopy classes of horizontal horocycles as we descend to\nthe real axis. We find these are stable during descent between encounters of\nthe horizontal horocycle with elliptic fixed points. Such encounters change ---\ncomplicate --- the homotopy classes. We give these explicitly down to height\n$1/(2\\sqrt{3})$.\n  Finally we do an initial study of the open (infinite length) horocycle path\nwith unit euclidean radius anchored at $\\phi -1$, where $\\phi$ is the Golden\nMean.

Using a\nnovel frame-based Lyapunov drift argument, we design a policy of admission\ncontrol and user selection that stabilizes the network with utility that can be\nmade arbitrarily close to the optimal in the constrained region.

Thus the network\ncontrol algorithm developed in this paper serves as a new approximation\nmethodology to attack such complex restless bandit problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 00:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-23"}

However,\nthere are open problems that suggest the need to incorporate more elaborate\nconstructions, specifically the use of higher-dimensional representations in\nthe Higgs sector. For example, a $45$ representation of SU(5) is often included\nto obtain correct mass relations for the first and second families of d-type\nquarks and leptons.

Upon cooling the sample below 15 K, unusual behaviour of\nthe temperature dependent muSR frequencies may indicate either a change of the\nmuon site, consistent with the observation of superstructure reflections in\nelectron diffraction or a change of the ordered magnetic structure. Neutron\ndiffraction data do not reveal any clear sign of either magnetic Bragg peaks or\nsuperlattice reflections. Furthermore, inelastic neutron scattering (INS)\nmeasurements clearly reveal the presence of a sharp inelastic excitation near\n11 meV between 5 K and 26 K, due to opening of a gap in the spin excitation\nspectrum, which transforms into a broad response at and above 30 K.

These progenitor disks are\nembedded in extended dark halos and during the evolution both components suffer\nstrong mass loss. In addition, the disks undergo the morphological\ntransformation into spheroids and the transition from ordered to random motion\nof their stars. Using collisionless N-body simulations we construct a model for\nthe nearby and highly elongated Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph galaxy within the\nframework of the tidal stirring scenario. Constrained by the present known\norbit of the dwarf, the model suggests that in order to produce the majority of\ntidal debris observed as the Sgr stream, but not yet transform the core of the\ndwarf into a spherical shape, Sgr must have just passed the second pericenter\nof its current orbit around the Milky Way. In the model, the stellar component\nof Sgr is still very elongated after the second pericenter and morphologically\nintermediate between the strong bar formed at the first pericenter and the\nalmost spherical shape existing after the third pericenter. This is thus the\nfirst model of the evolution of the Sgr dwarf that accounts for its observed\nvery elliptical shape. At the present time there is very little intrinsic\nrotation left and the velocity gradient detected along the major axis is almost\nentirely of tidal origin. We model the recently measured velocity dispersion\nprofile for Sgr assuming that mass traces light and estimate its current total\nmass within 5 kpc to be 5.2 x 10^8 M_sun. To have this mass at present, the\nmodel requires that the initial virial mass of Sgr must have been as high as\n1.6 x 10^10 M_sun, comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which may\nserve as a suitable analog for the pre-interaction, Sgr progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 09:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 17:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The model is known to generate\nearthquake sequences that quantitatively reproduce the spatial and temporal\nclustering of events observed in actual seismic patterns. The aim of the\npresent work is to investigate if this model can give support to the empirical\nevidence that earthquakes can be triggered by transient small perturbations,\nparticularly by the passing of seismic waves originated in events occurring in\nfar geographical locations. The effect of seismic waves is incorporated into\nthe model by assuming that they produce instantaneous small modifications in\nthe dynamical state of the system at the time they are applied. This change in\nthe dynamical state has two main effects. On one side, it induces earthquakes\nthat occur right at the application of the perturbation. These are called\nimmediate events. On the other side, after the application of the perturbation\nthere is a delayed effect: the seismic activity increases abruptly after the\nperturbation, then falls down below the level of background activity, and\neventually recovers to the background value. The time scale of these variations\ndepends on the internal dynamics of the system, and is totally independent of\nthe duration of the perturbation. The number of delayed events in excess of the\nbackground activity is typically observed to be around a factor of twenty\nlarger than the number of immediate events. The origin of the enhanced activity\nperiod following the perturbation is associated to the existence of aging\nrelaxation, and it does not occur if relaxation is absent. These findings give\nsupport to the experimental evidence that earthquake can be remotely triggered\nby small transient perturbations as those produced by seismic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 12:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We measure galaxy position-shape correlations in the\nMegaZ-LRG sample for more than 800,000 luminous red galaxies, making the first\nsuch measurement with a photometric redshift sample. In combination with a\nre-analysis of several spectroscopic SDSS samples, we constrain an intrinsic\nalignment model for early-type galaxies over long baselines in redshift (z ~\n0.7) and luminosity (4mag). We develop and test the formalism to incorporate\nphotometric redshift scatter in the modelling. For r_p > 6 Mpc/h, the fits to\ngalaxy position-shape correlation functions are consistent with the scaling\nwith r_p and redshift of a revised, nonlinear version of the linear alignment\nmodel for all samples. An extra redshift dependence proportional to (1+z)^n is\nconstrained to n=-0.3+/-0.8 (1sigma). To obtain consistent amplitudes for all\ndata, an additional dependence on galaxy luminosity proportional to L^b with\nb=1.1+0.3-0.2 is required.

It can be either active (ON) when it is transmitting data along\nits route, or idle (OFF).

Specifically, in absence of disturbing effects, e.g.\ntidal heating, their velocity dispersion is expected to vanish at large radii.\nIf such behaviour is not observed, and in particular if, as observed in\nelliptical galaxies, the dispersion is found constant at large radii below a\ncertain threshold acceleration, this might indicate a break down of Newtonian\ndynamics.\n  To minimise the effects of tidal heating in this paper we study the velocity\ndispersion profile of two distant globular clusters, NGC 1851 and NGC 1904.\n  The velocity dispersion profile is derived from accurate radial velocities\nmeasurements, obtained at the ESO 8m VLT telescope. Reliable data for 184 and\n146 bona fide cluster star members, respectively for NGC 1851 and NGC 1904,\nwere obtained.\n  These data allow to trace the velocity dispersion profile up to ~2r0, where\nr0 is the radius at which the cluster internal acceleration of gravity is a0 =\n10e-8 cm/s/s. It is found that in both clusters the velocity dispersion becomes\nconstant beyond ~r0. These new results are fully in agreement with those found\nfor other five globular clusters previously investigated as part of this\nproject. Taken all together, these 7 clusters support the claim that the\nvelocity dispersion is constant beyond r0, irrespectively of the specific\nphysical properties of the clusters: mass, size, dynamical history, and\ndistance from the Milky Way. The strong similarly with the constant velocity\ndispersion observed in elliptical galaxies beyond r0 is suggestive of a common\norigin for this phenomenon in the two class of objects, and might indicate a\nbreakdown of Newtonian dynamics below a0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 15:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
