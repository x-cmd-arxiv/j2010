Rateless codes allow each node of the\nnetwork to accumulate mutual information from every packet transmission. This\nenables a significant performance gain over conventional shortest path routing.\nFurther, it outperforms cooperative communication techniques that are based on\nenergy accumulation. However, it requires complex and combinatorial networking\ndecisions concerning which nodes participate in transmission, and which decode\nordering to use. We formulate three problems of interest in this setting: (i)\nminimum delay routing, (ii) minimum energy routing subject to delay constraint,\nand (iii) minimum delay broadcast. All of these are hard combinatorial\noptimization problems and we make use of several structural properties of their\noptimal solutions to simplify the problems and derive optimal greedy\nalgorithms. Although the reduced problems still have exponential complexity,\nunlike prior works on such problems, our greedy algorithms are simple to use\nand do not require solving any linear programs. Further, using the insight\nobtained from the optimal solution to a line network, we propose two simple\nheuristics that can be implemented in polynomial time and in a distributed\nfashion and compare them with the optimal solution. Simulations suggest that\nboth heuristics perform very close to the optimal solution over random network\ntopologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2010 01:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 04:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2011 02:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 22:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-18"}

Aims: If\nthe central compact objects of some GRBs are millisecond magentars, the\nmagnetar winds could play an important role in the (internal) X-ray afterglow\nemission, which is our focus here. Methods: The dynamics and the synchrotron\nradiation of the termination shock (TS) of the magmnetar winds, as well as the\nsimultaneous GRB ES, are investigated by considering the magnetization of the\nwinds. Results: As a result of the competition between the emission of the wind\nTS and the GRB ES, two basic types of X-ray afterglows are predicted, i.e., the\nTS-dominated and the ES-dominated types. Moreover, our results also show that\nboth of the two types of afterglows have a shallow-decay phase and a\nnormal-decay one, as observed by the \\textit{Swift} satellite.

Cloud computing platforms such as\nAmazon EC2 provide customers with flexible, on demand resources at low cost.\nHowever, they fail to provide seamless infrastructure management and monitoring\ncapabilities that many customers may need. For instance, Amazon EC2 doesn't\nfully support cloud services automated discovery and it requires a private set\nof authentication credentials. Salesforce.com, on the other hand, do not\nprovide monitoring access to their underlying systems. Moreover, these systems\nfail to provide infrastructure monitoring of heterogenous and legacy systems\nthat don't support agents.

One of the key issues addressed here is\nwhether low-power AGNs are more related to efficiently accreting systems\n(mostly radio-quiet) or to systems with very low accretion rates (mostly\nradio-loud). The emerging picture is the following. Radio-loud jet-dominated\nradio galaxies seem to be largely dominant down to flux densities of the order\nof e.g. S>400 microJy. At lower flux densities (S(1.4 GHz) > 100 microJy)\nradio-loud AGN are still present in significant numbers. However a population\nof radio-emitting AGNs, whose properties are consistent with those expected\nfrom existing radio-quiet AGN modeling, clearly shows up. This may indicate\nthat the bulk of the radio-quiet AGN population could emerge from studies of\ndeeper (S<100 microJy) radio samples. The radio-quiet AGN component could be\nrecognised thanks to the availability of IR colors which prove to be especially\nuseful to efficiently separate radio sources triggered by AGNs, from sources\ntriggered by star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2010 12:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}

Herein, we outline our theories for fold-recognition in the\n\"twilight-zone\" of sequence similarity (<25% identity). Our analyses\ndemonstrate that structural sequence profiles built using Position-Specific\nScoring Matrices (PSSMs) significantly outperform multiple popular\nhomology-modeling algorithms for relating and predicting structures given only\ntheir amino acid sequences. Importantly, structural sequence profiles\nreconstitute SCOP fold classifications in control and test datasets. Results\nfrom our experiments suggest that structural sequence profiles can be used to\nrapidly annotate protein folds at proteomic scales. We propose that encoding\nthe entire Protein DataBank (~1070 folds) into structural sequence profiles\nwould extract interoperable information capable of improving most if not all\nmethods of structural modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2010 15:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}
