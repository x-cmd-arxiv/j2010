Here, we use gate-controlled density with both\np and n carrier types to demonstrate the analog of the fiber-optic guiding in\ngraphene. Two basic effects are investigated: (1) bipolar p-n junction guiding,\nbased on the principle of angle-selective transmission though the graphene p-n\ninterface, and (2) unipolar fiber-optic guiding, using total internal\nreflection controlled by carrier density. Modulation of guiding efficiency\nthrough gating is demonstrated and compared to numerical simulations, which\nindicates that interface roughness limits guiding performance, with\nfew-nanometer effective roughness extracted.

We show that such a SLIV\npattern, due to which the true vacuum in the theory is chosen, induces massless\ntensor Goldstone modes some of which can naturally be associated with the\nphysical graviton. When expressed in terms of the pure Goldstone modes, this\ntheory looks essentially nonlinear and contains a variety of Lorentz and CPT\nviolating couplings. Nonetheless, all SLIV effects turn out to be strictly\ncancelled in all the lowest order processes considered, provided that the\ntensor field gravity theory is properly extended to general relativity (GR).\nSo, as we generally argue, the measurable effects of SLIV, induced by\nelementary vector or tensor fields, are related to the accompanying gauge\nsymmetry breaking rather than to spontaneous Lorentz violation. The latter\nappears by itself to be physically unobservable, only resulting in a\nnon-covariant gauge choice in an otherwise gauge invariant and Lorentz\ninvariant theory. However, while Goldstonic vector and tensor field theories\nwith exact local invariance are physically indistinguishable from conventional\ngauge theories, there might appear some principal distinctions if this local\nsymmetry were slightly broken at very small distances controlled by quantum\ngravity in an explicit, rather than spontaneous, way that could eventually\nallow one to differentiate between them observationally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 16:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 17:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 23:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 17:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-08"}

It is argued\nthat this problem actually corresponds to two inequivalent problems: (i) the\npreferred-decomposition problem, i.e., what singles out a preferred\ndecomposition of a suitable state vector of a system as the sum of a finite or\ncountable set of vectors?, and (ii) the preferred-representation problem, i.e.,\nwhat singles out a preferred representation for the Hilbert space of a system?\nIn this paper the preferred-decomposition problem is addressed and two\nprocesses, namely decoherence and permanent spatial decomposition (PSD), are\nexamined and compared as possible solutions to this problem. It is shown that,\nperhaps contrary to common belief, in realistic situations decoherence is not\nsufficient to solve the preferred-decomposition problem. PSD is the\n(hypothesized) tendency of the wave function of the universe to decompose into\npermanently non-overlapping wave packets. Three phases can be roughly\nidentified as composing PSD: Microscopic decomposition, amplification, and\ninteraction with the environment. Decoherence theory considers only the\ninteraction with the environment and ignores the first two phases. For this\nreason PSD is fundamentally different from decoherence and, unlike decoherence,\nprovides a simple and non-elusive solution to the preferred-decomposition\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 17:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}

The fields probe the outer\nstructure of the Clouds, the Magellanic Stream, the Leading Arm, and the wake\nof the new LMC orbit. Images were taken in 5 filters on the CTIO Blanco 4-m and\nMosaic2 camera, with calibration at the CTIO 0.9-m. The CRI images reach depths\nbelow the oldest LMC/SMC main sequence (MS) turnoffs, yielding probes of\nstructure combined with ability to measure stellar ages and metallicities. M\nand DDO51 images allow for discrimination of LMC and SMC giant stars from\nforeground dwarfs, allowing us to use giants as additional probes. From\nphotometry of 8 fields at radii of 7-19 degrees N of the LMC bar, we find MS\nstars associated with the LMC to 16 degrees from the LMC center, while the much\nrarer giants can only be convincingly detected out to 11 degrees. In one\ncontrol field, we see the signature of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 1851.\nThe CMDs show that while at 7-degree radius LMC populations as young as 500 Myr\nare present, at radii more than 11 degrees only the underlying old metal-poor\npopulation remains, demonstrating the existence of a population gradient. Even\nat extreme distances, the dominant age is much less than \"globular Cluster\nage.\" MS star counts follow an exponential decline with a scale length of 1.15\nkpc, essentially the same scale length as gleaned for the inner LMC disk from\nprior studies. While we cannot rule out tidal structure elsewhere, detection of\nordered structure to 12 disk scale lengths is unprecedented, and adds to the\npuzzle of the LMC's interaction history. Our results do not rule out the\npossible existence of an LMC stellar halo, which may only dominate the disk at\nyet larger radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2010 22:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The spectra were obtained with the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board\nthe infrared astronomical satellite AKARI, covering 2.5--5.0 um with a spectral\nresolution of approximately 120. The spectral types of the objects range from\nL5 to T8, and enable us to study the spectral evolution of brown dwarfs. The\nobserved spectra are in general consistent with the predictions from the\nprevious observations and photospheric models. We find that the CO fundamental\nband around 4.6 um is clearly seen even in the T8 dwarf 2MASS J041519-0935,\nconfirming the presence of non-equilibrium chemical state in the atmosphere. We\nalso identify the CO_2 fundamental stretching-mode band at 4.2 um for the first\ntime in the spectra of late-L and T-type brown dwarfs.\n  We analyze the observed spectra by comparing with the predicted ones based on\nthe Unified Cloudy Model (UCM). Although overall spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) can be reasonably fitted with the UCM, observed CO and CO_2 bands in\nlate-L and T-dwarfs are unexpectedly stronger than the model predictions\nassuming local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). We examine the vertical\nmixing model and find that this model explains the CO band at least partly in\nthe T-dwarfs 2MASS J041519-0935 and 2MASS J055919-1404. The CO fundamental band\nalso shows excess absorption against the predicted one in the L9 dwarf SDSS\nJ083008+4828. Since CO is already highly abundant in the upper photospheres of\nlate-L dwarfs, the extra CO by vertical mixing has little effect on the CO band\nstrengths, and the vertical mixing model cannot be applied to this L-dwarf. A\nmore serious problem is that the significant enhancement of the CO_2 4.2 um\nband in both the late-L and T dwarfs cannot be explained at all by the vertical\nmixing model. The enhancement of the CO_2 band remains puzzling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 00:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The notion of the\nnavigation automaton is generalized to include probabilistic uncontrollable\ntransitions, which account for uncertainties by modeling and planning for\nprobabilistic deviations from the computed policy in the course of execution.\nThe planning problem is solved by casting it in the form of a performance\nmaximization problem for probabilistic finite state automata.

The key idea is to reformulate the\ngauge invariance principle which, instead of being applied as usual at the\nlevel of the action, is applied at the level of the quantum fields. In other\nwords, we define gauge invariant quantum fields which are used to build the\naction. In that framework, the Higgs field is not necessarily a physical degree\nof freedom but can merely be a dressing field that does not propagate. If the\nHiggs boson is not propagating, the weak interactions must become strongly\ncoupled below 1 TeV and have a non-trivial fixed point and would thus be\nrenormalizable at the non-perturbative level. On the other hand, if a gauge\ninvariant Higgs boson is introduced in the model, its couplings to the fermions\nand the electroweak bosons can be quite different from those expected in the\nstandard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 09:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-11"}

This is largely due to the unsatisfactory treatment of non-vanishing\ndivergence of the magnetic field. Recently smoothed particle\nmagnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations based on Euler potentials have proven\nto be successful in treating MHD collapse and fragmentation problems, however\nthese methods are known to have some intrinsical difficulties. We have\nperformed SPMHD simulations based on a traditional approach evolving the\nmagnetic field itself using the induction equation. To account for the\nnumerical divergence, we have chosen an approach that subtracts the effects of\nnumerical divergence from the force equation, and additionally we employ\nartificial magnetic dissipation as a regularization scheme. We apply this\nrealization of SPMHD to a widely known setup, a variation of the 'Boss &\nBodenheimer standard isothermal test case', to study the impact of the magnetic\nfields on collapse and fragmentation. In our simulations, we concentrate on\nsetups, where the initial magnetic field is parallel to the rotation axis. We\nexamine different field strengths and compare our results to other findings\nreported in the literature.

Now, many millions of years later, the primary is an unseen\nwhite dwarf and the secondary has itself evolved into a giant which displays\nabsorption lines of barium in its spectrum and is what we call a barium star. A\nsimilar wind-accretion mechanism is also thought to form the low-metallicity CH\nand carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. Qualitatively the picture seems clear but\nquantitatively it is decidedly murky: several key outstanding problems remain\nwhich challenge our basic understanding of binary-star physics. Barium stars\nwith orbital periods less than about 4,000 days should -- according to theory\n-- be in circular orbits because of tidal dissipation, yet they are often\nobserved to be eccentric. Only one barium-star period longer than 10^4 days has\nbeen published although such stars are predicted to exist in large numbers. In\nthis paper we attempt to shed light on these problems. First, we consider the\nimpact of kicking the white dwarf at its birth, a notion which is supported by\nindependent evidence from studies of globular clusters. Second, we increase the\namount of orbital angular momentum loss during wind mass transfer, which\nshrinks barium-star binaries to the required period range. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of possible physical mechanisms and implications of a kick, such as\nthe break up of wide barium-star binaries and the limits imposed on our models\nby observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 13:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This requires that star formation in each star\nforming region had a short duration. The relative lack of scatter in the\n[alpha/Fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ISM prior to star formation. In\naddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo and\nthick disk share a similar massive star IMF.

We consider the issue of judgement aggregation from the\nperspective of approximation. That is, we generalize the previous results by\nstudying approximate judgement aggregation. We relax the main two constraints\nassumed in the current literature, Consistency and Independence and consider\nmechanisms that only approximately satisfy these constraints, that is, satisfy\nthem up to a small portion of the inputs. The main question we raise is whether\nthe relaxation of these notions significantly alters the class of satisfying\naggregation mechanisms. The recent works for preference aggregation of Kalai,\nMossel, and Keller fit into this framework. The main result of this paper is\nthat, as in the case of preference aggregation, in the case of a subclass of a\nnatural class of aggregation problems termed `truth-functional agendas', the\nset of satisfying aggregation mechanisms does not extend non-trivially when\nrelaxing the constraints.

The method, called adaptive\ntime-dependent coupled cluster, is a strict generalization of the formulation\nused in standard coupled cluster response theory, and also represents a\nsystematic hierarchy of size-consistent approximations, including standard\ntime-dependent Hartree--Fock as a trivial case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 15:21:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 18:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 08:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}
