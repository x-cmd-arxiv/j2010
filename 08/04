In the absence of the detachment pulse, undulating\npendant droplets are formed at the end of a properly fed metal wire due to the\nimpact of the primary laser pulse that induces melting. Eventually, these\ndroplets detach, i.e. overcome the surface tension, because of their increasing\nmass. We show that this spontaneous dripping is deterministically chaotic by\nmeans of a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence. In the\npresence of the detachment pulse, however, the generation of droplets is\nfastened depending on the pulse power. At high powers, the spontaneity of\ndripping is completely overshadowed by the impact of the detachment pulse.\nStill, amplitude chaos can be detected, which similarly as the spontaneous\ndripping, is characterized by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a\nnegative divergence, thus indicating that the observed dynamics is\ndeterministically chaotic with an attractor as solution in the phase space. In\nthe intermediate regime, i.e. for low and medium detachment pulse powers, the\ntwo chaotic states compete for supremacy, yielding an intermittent\nperiod-doubling to amplitude chaos transition, which we characterize by means\nof recurrence plots and their properties. Altogether, the transition from\nspontaneous to triggered laser droplet generation is characterized by a\nchaos-to-chaos transition with an intermediate dynamically nonstationary phase\nin-between. Since metal droplets can be used in various industrial\napplications, we hope that the accurate determination of the dynamical\nproperties underlying their formation will facilitate their use and guide\nfuture attempts at mathematical modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 17:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-07"}

One parameter sets the mass scale and the other three define how\nparticles within a mass shell are torqued throughout evolution. We choose\ntorque parameters motivated by tidal torque theory and N-body simulations and\nanalytically calculate the structure of the halo in different radial regimes.\nWe find that angular momentum plays an important role in determining the\ndensity profile at small radii. For cosmological initial conditions, the\ndensity profile on small scales is set by the time rate of change of the\nangular momentum of particles as well as the halo mass. On intermediate scales,\nhowever, $\\rho\\propto r^{-2}$, while $\\rho\\propto r^{-3}$ close to the virial\nradius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 22:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and\ndisplaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light\ncurves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the\ntime lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical\nformalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the\nproblems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated\nerrors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31\nquasars and reassess the BLR size--luminosity relationship using 60 H-beta\nlags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation\nmethods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad\nrange of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines\nand continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and\nprovides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these\ncorrelations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line\nvelocity--delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent\nlags or line responses.

We consider the effect of\nforced turbulent mixing in the radiative layer, which could be driven by\natmospheric circulation or by another mechanism. Due to stable stratification\nin the atmosphere, forced turbulence drives a downward flux of heat. Weak\nturbulent mixing slows the cooling rate by this process, as if the planet was\nirradiated more intensely. Stronger turbulent mixing buries heat into the\nconvective interior, provided the turbulence extends to the\nradiative-convective boundary. This inflates the planet until a balance is\nreached between the heat buried into and radiated from the interior. We also\ninclude the direct injection of heat due to the dissipation of turbulence or\nother effects. Such heating is already known to slow planetary cooling. We find\nthat dissipation also enhances heat burial from mixing by lowering the\nthreshold for turbulent mixing to drive heat into the interior. Strong\nturbulent mixing of heavy molecular species such as TiO may be necessary to\nexplain stratospheric thermal inversions. We show that the amount of mixing\nrequired to loft TiO may overinflate the planet by our mechanism. This possible\nrefutation of the TiO hypothesis deserves further study.

Two different test environments are set up, one (PHAT0) based on\nsimulations to test the basic functionality of the different photo-z codes, and\nanother one (PHAT1) based on data from the GOODS survey. The accuracy of the\ndifferent methods is expressed and ranked by the global photo-z bias, scatter,\nand outlier rates. Most methods agree well on PHAT0 but produce photo-z\nscatters that can differ by up to a factor of two even in this idealised case.\nA larger spread in accuracy is found for PHAT1. Few methods benefit from the\naddition of mid-IR photometry. Remaining biases and systematic effects can be\nexplained by shortcomings in the different template sets and the use of priors\non the one hand and an insufficient training set on the other hand. Scatters of\n4-8% in Delta_z/(1+z) were obtained, consistent with other studies. However,\nsomewhat larger outlier rates (>7.5% with Delta_z/(1+z)>0.15; >4.5% after\ncleaning) are found for all codes. There is a general trend that empirical\ncodes produce smaller biases than template-based codes. The systematic,\nquantitative comparison of different photo-z codes presented here is a snapshot\nof the current state-of-the-art of photo-z estimation and sets a standard for\nthe assessment of photo-z accuracy in the future.

Here we carry out the first\nsystematic numerical study of such passive scalar mixing in isothermal\nsupersonic turbulence. Our simulations show that the ratio of the scalar mixing\ntimescale, $\\tau_{\\rm c}$, to the flow dynamical time, $\\tau_{\\rm dyn}$\n(defined as the flow driving scale divided by the rms velocity), increases with\nthe Mach number, $M$, for $M \\lsim3$, and becomes essentially constant for $M\n\\gsim3.$ This trend suggests that compressible modes are less efficient in\nenhancing mixing than solenoidal modes. However, since the majority of kinetic\nenergy is contained in solenoidal modes at all Mach numbers, the overall change\nin $\\tau_{\\rm c}/\\tau_{\\rm dyn}$ is less than 20\\% over the range $1 \\lsim M\n\\lsim 6$. At all Mach numbers, if pollutants are injected at around the flow\ndriving scale, $\\tau_{\\rm c}$ is close to $\\tau_{\\rm dyn}.$ This suggests that\nscalar mixing is driven by a cascade process similar to that of the velocity\nfield. The dependence of $\\tau_{\\rm c}$ on the length scale at which pollutants\nare injected into flow is also consistent with this cascade picture. Similar\nbehavior is found for the variance decay timescales for scalars without\ncontinuing sources. Extension of the scalar cascade picture to the supersonic\nregime predicts a relation between the scaling exponents of the velocity and\nthe scalar structure functions, with the scalar structure function becoming\nflatter as the velocity scaling steepens with Mach number.

In contrast to\nlarge-size arrays with uniform-hopping rates where the atomic dynamics is known\nto be frozen in the strong-hopping regime, we show that resonant atom-field\ndynamics with significant energy exchange can occur in the case of staggered\nhopping rates even in the thermodynamic limit. This effect arises from the\njoint emergence of an energy gap in the free photonic dispersion relation and a\ndiscrete frequency at the gap's center. The latter corresponds to a bound\nnormal mode stemming solely from the finiteness of the array length. Depending\non which cavity is excited, either the atomic dynamics is frozen or a\nJaynes-Cummings-like energy exchange is triggered between the bound photonic\nmode and its atomic analogue. As these phenomena are effective with any number\nof cavities, they are prone to be experimentally observed even in small-size\narrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 00:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 22:28:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 20:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

The\nuse of game statistics in predicting player ability will be considered. Results\nusing data from the 2008/9 season suggest that LeBron James, who won the NBA\nMVP award, was the best overall player. The best defensive player was Lamar\nOdom and the best rookie was Russell Westbrook, neither of whom won an NBA\naward that season. The results further indicate that whilst the\nfrequently-reported game statistics provide some information on offensive\nability, they do not perform well in the prediction of defensive ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 05:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-05"}

We assume that E. coli is in a state of balanced\nexponential steadystate growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant\nenvironment, rich in resources. We apply this model to a series of past\nmeasurements, where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been\nmeasured for seven E. coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from\none to seven (the wild-type copy number). These experiments show that growth\nrate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the\nmodel, we were able to reproduce these measurements. We show that the model\nthat best fits these data suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules\ninside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied.\nMoreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven\nresults in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming\nthat under such overcrowded conditions prolonged diffusion times tend to weaken\nbinding affinities, the model predicts that growth rate will not increase\nsubstantially beyond the wild-type growth rate, as indicated by other\nexperiments. Our model therefore suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy\nnumber of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does\nnot substantially increase their growth rate. Other observations regarding\nstrains with an altered rRNA operon copy number, such as nucleoid compaction\nand the rRNA operon feedback response, appear to be qualitatively consistent\nwith this model. In addition, we discuss possible design principles suggested\nby the model and propose further experiments to test its validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 08:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-05"}

In 2-dimensional space, we prove that the Kantorovich\nfunction is convex if and only if the condition number of its matrix is bounded\nabove by $3+2\\sqrt{2}, $ and thus the convexity of the function with two\nvariables can be completely characterized by the condition number. The upper\nbound `$3+2\\sqrt{2} $' is turned out to be a necessary condition for the\nconvexity of Kantorovich functions in any finite-dimensional spaces.

Furthermore, we prove that this general sufficient\nconvexity condition can be remarkably improved in 3-dimensional space.

We find a statistically\nsignificant difference in the c_SB distributions of the two high-z samples,\npointing towards a lack of concentrated clusters in the 400 SD high-z sample.\nTaking this into account, we confirm a negative evolution in the fraction of\ncool-core clusters with redshift, in particular for very strong cool-cores.\nThis result is validated by the central entropy and central cooling time, which\nshow strong anti-correlations with c_SB. However, the amount of evolution is\nsignificantly smaller than previously claimed, leaving room for a large\npopulation of well formed cool-cores at z~1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 11:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Important issues\nare the epoch at which the bulk of the stars in these regions formed and how\ndiscs grow radially over time. To address these issues, we use Hubble Space\nTelescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging to study the star formation\nhistory (SFH) of two fields at 9.1 and 11.6 kpc along M33's northern major\naxis. These fields lie at ~ 4 and 5 V-band disc scale-lengths and straddle the\nbreak in M33's surface brightness profile. The colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)\nreach the ancient main sequence turnoff with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~ 5.\nFrom detailed modelling of the CMDs, we find that the majority of stars in both\nfields combined formed at z < 1. The mean age in the inner field, S1, is ~ 3\n+/- 1 Gyr and the mean metallicity is [M/H] ~ -0.5 +/- 0.2 dex. The star\nformation history of S1 unambiguously reveals how the inside-out growth\npreviously measured for M33's inner disc out to ~ 6 kpc extends out to the disc\nedge at ~ 9 kpc. In comparison, the outer field, S2, is older (mean age ~ 7 +/-\n2 Gyr), more metal-poor (mean [M/H] ~ -0.8 +/- 0.3 dex), and contains ~ 30\ntimes less stellar mass. These results provide the most compelling evidence yet\nthat M33's age gradient reverses at large radii near the disc break and that\nthis reversal is accompanied by a break in stellar mass surface density. We\ndiscuss several possible interpretations of this behaviour including radial\nstellar mixing, warping of the gaseous disc, a change in star formation\nefficiency, and a transition to another structural component. These results\noffer one of the most detailed views yet of the peripheral regions of any disc\ngalaxy and provide a much-needed observational constraint on the last major\nepoch of star formation in the outer disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 12:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Unlike in previous studies, this allows for combining multiple physical\nimage parameters, such as minimum and maximum values of the absorption\ncoefficient for identifying affected and not affected joints.

The most popular scenarios for this intriguing phenomenon\ninvoke either hydrodynamical backflows and over-pressured cocoons or rapid jet\nreorientations, presumably from the spin-flips of central engines following the\nmergers of pairs of galaxies, each of which contains a supermassive black hole\n(SMBH). We confront these models with a number of key observations and thus\nargue that none of the models is capable of explaining the entire range of\nsalient observational properties of XRGs, although some of the arguments raised\nin the literature against the spin-flip scenario are probably not tenable. We\nthen propose here a new scenario which also involves galactic mergers but would\nallow the spin of the central engine to maintain its direction. Motivated by\nthe detailed multi-band observations of the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A,\nthis new model emphasizes the role of interactions between the jets and the\nshells of stars and gas that form and rotate around the merged galaxy and can\ncause temporary deflections of the jets, occasionally giving rise to an\nX-shaped radio structure. Although each of the models is likely to be relevant\nto a subset of XRGs, the bulk of the evidence indicates that most of them are\nbest explained by the jet-shell interaction or spin-flip hypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 14:33:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 22:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de Vaucouleurs\nclassification volume in the 3.6 micron band, which is the best Spitzer\nwaveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and its\nreddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. For this purpose, we have\nprepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the Spitzer archive, most\nof which are formally part of the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in\nGalaxies (S^4G), a Spitzer post-cryogenic (\"warm\") mission Exploration Science\nLegacy Program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 Mpc. For the purposes of\nmorphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are {\\it blue light},\nthe historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. We find\nthat 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-light\nclassifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxies\nlook very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. Drastic\ndifferences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. Consistent with a\nprevious study by Eskridge et al. (2002), the main difference between blue\nlight and mid-IR types is an approximately 1 stage interval difference for S0/a\nto Sbc or Sc galaxies, which tend to appear \"earlier\" in type at 3.6 microns\ndue to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects of\nextinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of the\nextreme population I stellar component.
