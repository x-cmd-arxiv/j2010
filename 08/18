The detailed high-quality spectra allow us to\ncleanly separate star formation (SF) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) in\nindividual galaxies. We first decompose mid-infrared Luminosity Functions\n(LFs). We find that the SF 8um and 15um LFs are well described by Schechter\nfunctions. AGNs dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads to\nthe shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared LFs. The total\ninfrared (8-1000um) LF from 70um selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-end\nslope than the bolometrically corrected SF 15um LF, owing to the intrinsic\ndispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. We then\nstudy the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes\n(BHs). Seven of the 31 Luminous Infrared Galaxies with Spitzer spectra host\nluminous AGNs, implying an AGN duty cycle of 23+/-9%. The time-averaged ratio\nof BH accretion rate and SF rate matches the local M_BH-M_bulge relation and\nthe M_BH-M_host relation at z ~ 1. These results favor co-evolution scenarios\nin which BH growth and intense SF happen in the same event but the former spans\na shorter lifetime than the latter. Finally, we compare our mid-infrared\nspectroscopic selection with other AGN identification methods and discuss\ncandidate Compton-thick AGNs in the sample. While only half of the mid-infrared\nspectroscopically selected AGNs are detected in X-ray, ~90% of them can be\nidentified with their near-infrared spectral indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 16:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The co-existence of multi-scale structures such as auroral\narcs, turbulent convective flows, and scale-free distributions of energy\nperturbations has lacked a unified explanation, although there is strong reason\nto believe that they all stem from a common base of physics. In this paper we\nshow that a slow but turbulent convection leads to the formation of multi-scale\ncurrent filaments reminiscent of auroral arcs. The process involves an\ninterplay between random shuffling of field lines and dissipation of magnetic\nenergy on sub-MHD scales. As the filament system reaches a critical level of\ncomplexity, local current disruption can trigger avalanches of energy release\nof varying sizes, leading to scale-free distributions over energy perturbation,\npower, and event duration. A long-term memory effect is observed whereby the\nfilament system replicates itself after each avalanche. The results support the\nview that that the classical and inverse cascades operate simultaneously in the\nmagnetosphere. In the former, the high Reynolds-number plasma flow disintegrate\ninto turbulence through successive breakdowns; in the latter, the interactions\nof small-scale flow eddies with the magnetic field can self-organize into\nelongated current filaments and large-scale energy avalanches mimicking the\nsubstorm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 17:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The pure supergravity part of the total action has a local\nPoincare supersymmetry, whereas the chiral and vector multiplets coupled to\nsupergravity have a larger local superconformal symmetry. The scale-free\nglobally supersymmetric theories, such as the NMSSM with a scale-invariant\nsuperpotential, can be naturally embedded into this class of theories. After\nthe supergravity embedding, the Jordan frame scalar potential of such theories\nremains scale free; it is quartic, it contains no mass terms, no\nnonrenormalizable terms, no cosmological constant. The local superconformal\nsymmetry can be broken by additional terms, which, in the small field limit,\nare suppressed by the gravitational coupling. This can be achieved by\nintroducing the nonminimal scalar-curvature coupling, and by taking into\naccount interactions with a hidden sector. In this approach, the smallness of\nthe mass parameters in the NMSSM may be traced back to the original\nsuperconformal invariance. This allows to address the \\mu-problem and the\ncosmological domain wall problem in this model, and to implement chaotic\ninflation in the NMSSM. We discuss the gravitino problem in the NMSSM\ninflation, as well as the possibility to obtain a broad class of new versions\nof chaotic inflation in supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 17:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 18:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 21:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}

Loop amplitudes arise from\nthe \"entangled\" removal of pairs of particles, and are naturally presented as\nan integral over lines in momentum-twistor space. As expected from manifest\nYangian-invariance, the integrand is given as a sum over non-local terms,\nrather than the familiar decomposition in terms of local scalar integrals with\nrational coefficients. Knowing the integrands explicitly, it is straightforward\nto express them in local forms if desired; this turns out to be done most\nnaturally using a novel basis of chiral, tensor integrals written in\nmomentum-twistor space, each of which has unit leading singularities. As simple\nillustrative examples, we present a number of new multi-loop results written in\nlocal form, including the 6- and 7-point 2-loop NMHV amplitudes. Very concise\nexpressions are presented for all 2-loop MHV amplitudes, as well as the 5-point\n3-loop MHV amplitude. The structure of the loop integrand strongly suggests\nthat the integrals yielding the physical amplitudes are \"simple\", and\ndetermined by IR-anomalies. We briefly comment on extending these ideas to more\ngeneral planar theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 20:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

This field has a wealth of\nground- and space-based ancillary data, and contains the GOODS-South field and\nthe Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We combine the Subaru imaging with existing\nUBVRIzJHK and Spitzer IRAC images to create a uniform catalog. Detecting\nsources in the MUSYC BVR image we find ~40,000 galaxies with R_AB<25.3, the\nmedian 5 sigma limit of the 18 medium bands. Photometric redshifts are\ndetermined using the EAZY code and compared to ~2000 spectroscopic redshifts in\nthis field. The medium band filters provide very accurate redshifts for the\n(bright) subset of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, particularly at 0.1 <\nz < 1.2 and at z > 3.5. For 0.1 < z < 1.2, we find a 1 sigma scatter in \\Delta\nz/(1+z) of 0.007, similar to results obtained with a similar filter set in the\nCOSMOS field. As a demonstration of the data quality, we show that the red\nsequence and blue cloud can be cleanly identified in rest-frame color-magnitude\ndiagrams at 0.1 < z < 1.2. We find that ~20% of the red-sequence-galaxies show\nevidence of dust-emission at longer rest-frame wavelengths. The reduced images,\nphotometric catalog, and photometric redshifts are provided through the public\nMUSYC website.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 21:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-19"}

A fundamental\nfeature of that diversity is the necessity to classify individual jammed\nconfigurations according to whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly\njammed. Each of these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations\nspanning a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive\nproperties, including packing fraction $\\phi$, mean contact number $Z$, and\nseveral scalar order metrics. Application of these analytical tools to spheres\nin three dimensions (an analog to the venerable Ising model) covers a myriad of\njammed states, including maximally dense packings (as Kepler conjectured),\nlow-density strictly-jammed tunneled crystals, and a substantial family of\namorphous packings.

Because of their relevance to\nerror-correcting codes and information theory, sphere packings in\nhigh-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been included as well.

The formation of NSCs is inevitable in\nthe context of normal star formation in which a majority of stars form in\nclusters. A young, mass-losing cluster embedded in an isolated star-forming\ngalaxy remains gravitationally bound over a period determined by its initial\nmass and the galactic tidal field. The cluster migrates radially toward the\ncenter of the galaxy and becomes integrated in the NSC if it reaches the\ncenter. The rate at which the NSC grows by accreting young clusters can be\nestimated from empirical cluster formation rates and dissolution times. We\nmodel cluster migration and dissolution and find that the NSCs in late-type\ndisks and in spheroidals could have assembled from migrating clusters. The\nresulting stellar nucleus contains a small fraction of the stellar mass of the\ngalaxy; this fraction is sensitive to the high-mass truncation of the initial\ncluster mass function (ICMF). The resulting NSC masses are consistent with the\nobserved values, but generically, the final NSCs are surrounded by a spatially\nmore extended excess over the inward-extrapolated exponential (or Sersic) law\nof the outer galaxy. We suggest that the excess can be related to the\npseudobulge phenomenon in disks, though not all of the pseudobulge mass\nassembles this way. Comparison with observed NSC masses can be used to\nconstrain the truncation mass scale of the ICMF and the fraction of clusters\nsuffering prompt dissolution.

(2007) independently\ndetermined the age of B379, which is in good agreement with the determination\nof Brown et al. (2004a). The BC03 models are calculated based on the Padova\nevolutionary tracks. It is necessary to check whether the age of B379 which,\nbeing determined based on the Padova evolutionary tracks, is in agreement with\nthe determination of Brown et al. (2004a). So, in this paper, we re-determine\nits age using isochrones of the Padova stellar evolutionary models. In\naddition, the metal abundance, the distance modulus, and the reddening value\nfor B379 are also determined in this paper. The results obtained in this paper\nare consistent with the previous determinations, which including the age\nobtained by Brown et al. (2004a). So, this paper confirms the consistence of\nthe age scale of B379 between the Padova isochrones and the 2006 VandenBerg\nisochrones, i.e. the results' comparison between Brown et al. (2004a) and Ma et\nal. (2007) is meaningful. The results obtained in this paper are: the\nmetallicity [M/H]=-0.325, the age $\\tau=11.0\\pm1.5$ Gyr, the reddening value\nE(B-V)=0.08, and the distance modulus $(m-M)_{0}=24.44\\pm0.10$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 01:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, existing TLS approaches do not account for sparsity possibly\npresent in the unknown vector of regression coefficients. On the other hand,\nsparsity is the key attribute exploited by modern compressive sampling and\nvariable selection approaches to linear regression, which include noise in the\ndata, but do not account for perturbations in the regression matrix. The\npresent paper fills this gap by formulating and solving TLS optimization\nproblems under sparsity constraints. Near-optimum and reduced-complexity\nsuboptimum sparse (S-) TLS algorithms are developed to address the perturbed\ncompressive sampling (and the related dictionary learning) challenge, when\nthere is a mismatch between the true and adopted bases over which the unknown\nvector is sparse. The novel S-TLS schemes also allow for perturbations in the\nregression matrix of the least-absolute selection and shrinkage selection\noperator (Lasso), and endow TLS approaches with ability to cope with sparse,\nunder-determined \"errors-in-variables\" models. Interesting generalizations can\nfurther exploit prior knowledge on the perturbations to obtain novel weighted\nand structured S-TLS solvers. Analysis and simulations demonstrate the\npractical impact of S-TLS in calibrating the mismatch effects of contemporary\ngrid-based approaches to cognitive radio sensing, and robust\ndirection-of-arrival estimation using antenna arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 02:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

Particularly, being\nsubjected to significant fluxes of fusion neutrons RAFM steel suffers\nconsiderable local volume variations in the radiation damage involved regions.\nIt is necessary to study the structure properties of the alloying elements in\ncontraction and expansion states. In this paper we studied local substitution\nstructures of thirteen alloying elements Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Si,\nTa, Ti, V, and W in bcc Fe and calculated their substitutional energies in the\nvolume variation range from -1.0% to 1.0%. From the structure relaxation\nresults of the first five neighbor shells around the substitutional atom we\nfind the relaxation in each neighbor shell keeps approximately uniform within\nthe volume variation from -1.0% to 1.0% except those of Mn and the relaxation\nof the fifth neighbor shell is stronger than that of the third and forth,\nindicating that the lattice distortion due to the substitution atom is easier\nto spread in <111> direction than in other direction. The relaxation pattern\nand intensity are related to the size and electron structure of the\nsubstitutional atom. For some alloying elements, such as Mo, Nb, Ni, Ta, Ti and\nW, the substitutional energy decreases noticeably when the volume increases.\nFurther analysis show that the substitutional energy comprises the energy\nvariation originated from local structure relaxation and the chemical potential\ndifference of the substitutional atom between its elemental crystalline state\nand the solid solution phase in bcc Fe. We think the approximately uniform\nrelaxation of each neighbor shell around a substitutional atom give rise to a\nlinear decrease in the substitutional energy with the increasing volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 02:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-19"}

In the hard X-ray regime, a high longitudinal coherence will be\nthe key to such performance upgrade. The method considered here to obtain high\nlongitudinal coherence is based on a novel single-bunch self-seeding scheme\nexploiting a single crystal monochromator, which is extremely compact and can\nbe straightforwardly installed in the LCLS baseline undulator. We present\nsimulation results dealing with the LCLS hard X-ray FEL, and show that this\nmethod can produce fully-coherent X-ray pulses at 100 GW power level. With the\nradiation beam monochromatized down to the Fourier transform limit, a variety\nof very different techniques leading to further improvements of the LCLS\nperformance become feasible. In particular, we describe an efficient way for\nobtaining full polarization control at the LCLS hard X-ray FEL.

The hard X-ray beam can be deflected of an\nangle of order of a radian without perturbations. The monochromatization of the\noutput radiation constitutes the key for reaching such result.

We find that, at given galactic stellar mass $M_*$,\nmodel adopting late infall-peak time $t_p$ results in blue colors, low\nmetallicity, high specific star formation rate and high gas fraction, while gas\noutflow rate mainly influences the gas-phase metallicity and star formation\nefficiency mainly influences the gas fraction.

Our models appear to require a\nrelatively steep initial mass function for stars above about turnoff, with an\nindex of about 2.8 (where the Salpeter mass function has an index of 2.35), and\na relatively flat initial mass function (index about 0.4) for the lower main\nsequence. According to the model, the current mass is estimated at 0.9 million\nsolar masses, of which about 34% consists of remnants. We find that primordial\nbinaries are gradually taking over from mass loss by stellar evolution as the\nmain dynamical driver of the core. Despite the high concentration of the\ncluster, core collapse will take at least another 20Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 08:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The extra-stress tensor stems\nfrom the random movement of the polymer chains and is defined by the Kramers\nexpression through the associated probability density function that satisfies a\nFokker-Planck-type parabolic equation, a crucial feature of which is the\npresence of a center-of-mass diffusion term.

In this paper, we are interested in deriving the asymptotic\ndistributions of the test statistics of the EBD algorithms. Two EBD algorithms\nusing sample covariance matrices are considered: maximum eigenvalue detection\n(MED) and condition number detection (CND). The earlier studies usually assume\nthat the number of antennas (K) and the number of samples (N) are both large,\nthus random matrix theory (RMT) can be used to derive the asymptotic\ndistributions of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the sample covariance\nmatrices. While assuming the number of antennas being large simplifies the\nderivations, in practice, the number of antennas equipped at a single secondary\nuser is usually small, say 2 or 3, and once designed, this antenna number is\nfixed. Thus in this paper, our objective is to derive the asymptotic\ndistributions of the eigenvalues and condition numbers of the sample covariance\nmatrices for any fixed K but large N, from which the probability of detection\nand probability of false alarm can be obtained.

A set of simple distribution functions are\nintroduced to describe anisotropic and rotating stellar populations embedded in\ndark haloes of approximate Navarro-Frenk-White form. The BHB stars in the Milky\nWay halo exhibit a dichotomy between a prograde rotating, comparatively\nmetal-rich component ([Fe/H] > -2) and a retrograde rotating, comparatively\nmetal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2) component. The prograde metal-rich population may be\nassociated with the accretion of a massive satellite (~ 10^9 solar masses). The\nmetal-poor population may characterise the primordial stellar halo and the net\nretrograde rotation could then reflect an underestimate in our adopted local\nstandard of rest circular velocity Theta_0. If Theta_0 is ~ 240 km/s then the\nmetal-poor component has no rotation and there is a net prograde rotation\nsignal of ~45 km/s in the metal-rich component.

This implies that these\nintegrands can be reconstructed from a subset of their `single cuts'. The main\ntool is powercounting Feynman graphs in a special lightcone gauge choice\nemployed earlier at tree level by Arkani-Hamed and Kaplan. The relation between\nshifts of integrands and shifts of its integrals is investigated explicitly at\none loop. Two particular sources of discrepancy between the integral and\nintegrand are identified related to UV and IR divergences. This is\ncross-checked with known results for helicity equal amplitudes at one loop. The\nnature of the on-shell residue at each of the single-cut singularities of the\nintegrand is commented upon. Several natural conjectures and opportunities for\nfurther research present themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 14:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2010 15:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

X-ray cavities blown by the\ncentral Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) contain enough energy to heat the\nsurrounding gas and stop cooling, but locally blobs or filaments of gas appear\nto be able to cool to low temperatures of 10^4 K. In X-rays, however, gas with\ntemperatures lower than 0.5 keV is not observed. Using a deep XMM-Newton\nobservation of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2052, we derive 2D maps of the\ntemperature, entropy, and iron abundance in the core region. About 130 kpc\nSouth-West of the central galaxy, we discover a discontinuity in the surface\nbrightness of the hot gas which is consistent with a cold front. Interestingly,\nthe iron abundance jumps from ~0.75 to ~0.5 across the front. In a smaller\nregion to the North-West of the central galaxy we find a relatively high\ncontribution of cool 0.5 keV gas, but no X-ray emitting gas is detected below\nthat temperature. However, the region appears to be associated with much cooler\nH-alpha filaments in the optical waveband. The elliptical shape of the cold\nfront in the SW of the cluster suggests that the front is caused by sloshing of\nthe hot gas in the clusters gravitational potential. This effect is probably an\nimportant mechanism to transport metals from the core region to the outer parts\nof the cluster. The smooth temperature profile across the sharp jump in the\nmetalicity indicates the presence of heat conduction and the lack of mixing\nacross the discontinuity. The cool blob of gas NW of the central galaxy was\nprobably pushed away from the core and squeezed by the adjacent bubble, where\nit can cool efficiently and relatively undisturbed by the AGN.

Our flat cloud geometry is\nmotivated by models of molecular cloud formation due to large-scale flows in\nthe interstellar medium. The experiments consisted of SPH simulations of gas\naccretion onto sink particles formed rapidly from Jeans-unstable dense clumps\nplaced randomly in the finite sheet. These simplifications allow us to study\naccretion with a minimum of free parameters, and to develop better statistics\non the resulting mass spectra. We considered both clumps of equal mass and\ngaussian distributions of masses, and either uniform or spatially-varying gas\ndensities. In all cases, the sink mass function develops a power law tail at\nhigh masses, with $dN/dlog M \\propto M^{-\\Gamma}$. The accretion rates of\nindividual sinks follow $\\dot{M} \\propto M^2$ at high masses; this results in a\ncontinual flattening of the slope of the mass function towards an asymptotic\nform $\\Gamma \\sim 1$ (where the Salpeter slope is $\\Gamma = 1.35$). The\nasymptotic limit is most rapidly reached when starting from a relatively broad\ndistribution of initial sink masses. In general the resulting upper mass slope\nis correlated with the maximum sink mass; higher sink masses are found in\nsimulations with flatter upper mass slopes. Although these simulations are of a\nhighly idealized situation, the results suggest that competitive accretion may\nbe relevant in a wider variety of environments than previously considered, and\nin particular that the upper mass distribution may generally evolve towards a\nlimiting value of $\\Gamma \\sim 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 06:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
