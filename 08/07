A narrow filament-like structure\nwas observed extending south-east from the central proto-binary system towards\nTMR-1C, suggesting a morphology in which the candidate protoplanet may have\nbeen ejected from the TMR-1 system. Follow-up low-resolution spectroscopy could\nnot confirm if this object is a protoplanet or a low-luminosity background\nstar. We present two epochs of near-infrared photometric observations obtained\nat the CFHT of TMR-1C. The time span of ~7 years between the two sets of\nobservations provides with an opportunity to, (a) check for any photometric\nvariability similar to that observed among young stellar objects, which would\nindicate the youth of this source, and, (b) determine the proper motion. TMR-1C\ndisplays large photometric variability between 1 and 2 mag in both the H- and\nKs-bands. From our 2002 observations, we find a (H-Ks) color of 0.3 mag, which\nis much bluer than the value of 1.3 mag reported by T98 from HST observations.\nAlso, we observe brightening in both the H- and Ks-bands when the colors are\nbluer, i.e. the object gets redder as it becomes fainter. We have explored the\npossible origins for the observed variability, and find extinction due to the\npresence of circumstellar material to be the most likely scenario. The observed\nlarge-amplitude photometric variations, and the possible presence of a\ncircumstellar disk, are strong arguments against this object being an old\nbackground star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 18:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this work we have performed a detailed numerical study of the\nproperties of the RL, both in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)\nlattices.

This leads us to\npropose that the RL should share many properties of ferromagnetic models, an\nidea that recently has also been proposed in other contexts.

In binary\nsystems, this issue is more complex because the disc should in addition respond\nto the companion star's perturbations. We explore the dynamical evolution of a\ncollisionally active debris disc for different initial parent body populations,\ndiverse binary configurations and optical depths. We focus on the radial extent\nand size distribution of the disc at a stationary state. We numerically follow\nthe evolution of $10^{5}$ massless small grains, initially produced from a\ncircumprimary disc of parent bodies following a size distribution in $dN\n\\propto s^{-3.5}$ds . Grains are submitted to both stars' gravity as well as\nradiation pressure. In addition, particles are assigned an empirically derived\ncollisional lifetime. For all the binary configurations the disc extends far\nbeyond the critical semimajor axis $a_crit$ for orbital stability. This is due\nto the steady production of small grains, placed on eccentric orbits reaching\nbeyond $a_crit$ by radiation pressure. The amount of matter beyond acrit\ndepends on the balance between collisional production and dynamical removal\nrates: it increases for more massive discs as well as for eccentric binaries.\nAnother important effect is that, in the dynamically stable region, the disc is\ndepleted from its smallest grains. Both results could lead to observable\nsignatures. We have shown that a companion star can never fully truncate a\ncollisionally active disc. For eccentric companions, grains in the unstable\nregions can significantly contribute to the thermal emission in the mid-IR.\nDiscs with sharp outer edges, especially bright ones such as HR4796A, are\nprobably shaped by other mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 19:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This network\ncontains all known interactions and functional modules (i.e. groups of\nproteins) coordinately responding to HCMV entry. The number of both genes and\nfunctional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly,\nwithin 25 min post-infection. While modules annotated as receptor system, ion\ntransport, and immune response are continuously activated during the entire\nprocess of HCMV entry, those for cell adhesion and skeletal movement are\nspecifically activated during viral early attachment, and those for immune\nresponse during virus entry. HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network\ninvolving different cellular components, comprising not only cell surface\nreceptors, but also pathway components in signal transduction, skeletal\ndevelopment, immune response, endocytosis, ion transport, macromolecule\nmetabolism and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, genes that function in\nchromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system, suggesting\nthat global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in\nHCMV entry.

Most of these stars will have convective cores during their\nMain-sequence evolution. At the edges of these convective cores there is a\nrapid variation in the sound speed which influences the frequencies of acoustic\noscillations. In this paper we build on earlier work by Cunha and Metcalfe, to\ninvestigate further the impact that these rapid structural variations have on\ndifferent p-mode frequency combinations, involving modes of low degree. In\nparticular, we adopt a different expression to describe the sound speed\nvariation at the edge of the core, which we show to reproduce more closely the\nprofiles derived from the equilibrium models. We analyse the impact of this\nchange on the frequency perturbation derived for radial modes. Moreover, we\nconsider three different small frequency separations involving, respectively,\nmodes of degree l = 0, 1, 2, 3; l = 0, 1; and l = 0, 2, and show that they are\nall significantly affected by the sharp sound speed variation at the edge of\nthe core. In particular, we confirm that the frequency derivative of the\ndiagnostic tool that combines modes of degree up to 3 can potentially be used\nto infer directly the amplitude of the relative sound speed variation at the\nedge of the core. Concerning the other two diagnostic tools, we show that at\nhigh frequencies they can be up to a few microhertzs smaller than what would be\nexpected in the absence of the rapid structural variation at the edge of the\ncore. Also, we show that the absolute values of their frequency derivatives are\nsignificantly increased, in a manner that is strongly dependent on stellar age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2010 03:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 17:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

According to the AMD, the Be-9 nucleus consists of\ntwo alpha-like clusters with a surrounding neutron. The clustering produces\nhigh-momentum components in nuclear wave functions, which affects nuclear\nmodifications of the structure functions. We investigated whether clustering\nfeatures could appear in the structure function F_2 of Be-9 along with studies\nfor other light nuclei.

The starting point of our perturbative expansion is a\nzeroth-order Hamiltonian for an electron confined in a quantum wire with an\neffective spin-orbit induced magnetic field along the wire, obtained by\nproperly rotating the usual spin-orbit Hamiltonian. We find that the\nspin-orbit-related transverse coupling terms can be recast into two parts W and\nV, which couple crossing and non-crossing adjacent transverse modes,\nrespectively. Interestingly, the zeroth-order Hamiltonian together with W can\nbe solved exactly, as it maps onto the Jaynes-Cummings model of quantum optics.\nWe treat the V coupling by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. This\nallows us to obtain an effective Hamiltonian to third order in the coupling\nstrength k_Rl of V, which can be straightforwardly diagonalized via an\nadditional unitary transformation. We also apply our approach to other types of\neffective parabolic confinement, e.g., 2D electrons in a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approximate eigensolutions, we\nobtain analytical expressions for the n^th Landau-level g_n-factors in the\npresence of both Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings.

We here discuss a new\nscenario in which the observed unusually low nitrogen abundances can be closely\nassociated with recent collision and subsequent accretion of HI high velocity\nclouds (HVCs) that surround the Galaxy and have low nitrogen abundances. We\nshow that if the observed low [N/H] is limited to very young stars with ages\nless than ~10^7 yr, then the collision/accretion rate of the HVCs onto the LMC\nneeds to be ~ 0.2 M_sun/yr (corresponding to the total HVC mass of 10^6-10^7\nM_sun) to dilute the original interstellar medium (ISM) before star formation.\nThe required accretion rate means that even if the typical mass of HVCs\naccreted onto the LMC is ~ 10^7 M_sun, the Galaxy needs to have ~2500 massive\nHVCs within the LMC's orbital radius with respect to the Galactic center. The\nrequired rather large number of massive HVCs drives us to suggest that the HVCs\nare not likely to efficiently dilute the ISM of the LMC and consequently lower\nthe [N/H]. We thus suggest the transfer of gas with low [N/H] from the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) to the LMC as a promising scenario that can explain the\nobserved low [N/H].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2010 10:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

They can also be extended to some dispersive wave\nequations, such as the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Superpositions of Gaussian beams\nprovide a powerful tool to generate more general high frequency solutions that\nare not necessarily concentrated on a single curve. This work is concerned with\nthe accuracy of Gaussian beam superpositions in terms of the wavelength\n$\\epsilon$. We present a systematic construction of Gaussian beam\nsuperpositions for all strictly hyperbolic and Schr\\\"odinger equations subject\nto highly oscillatory initial data of the form $Ae^{i\\Phi/\\epsilon}$. Through a\ncareful estimate of an oscillatory integral operator, we prove that the $k$-th\norder Gaussian beam superposition converges to the original wave field at a\nrate proportional to $\\epsilon^{k/2}$ in the appropriate norm dictated by the\nwell-posedness estimate. In particular, we prove that the Gaussian beam\nsuperposition converges at this rate for the acoustic wave equation in the\nstandard, $\\epsilon$-scaled, energy norm and for the Schr\\\"odinger equation in\nthe $L^2$ norm. The obtained results are valid for any number of spatial\ndimensions and are unaffected by the presence of caustics. We present a\nnumerical study of convergence for the constant coefficient acoustic wave\nequation in $\\Real^2$ to analyze the sharpness of the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2010 10:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 19:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}

However, for ``large $p$ and small $n$\" models sparsity\nassumption is hard to check and particularly, when this assumption is violated,\nthe consistency of all existing estimations is usually impossible because\nworking models selected by existing methods such as the LASSO and the Dantzig\nselector are usually biased. To attack this problem, we in this paper propose\nadaptive post-Dantzig estimation and model prediction. Here the adaptability\nmeans that the consistency based on the newly proposed method is adaptive to\nnon-sparsity of model, choice of shrinkage tuning parameter and dimension of\npredictor vector. The idea is that after a sub-model as a working model is\ndetermined by the Dantzig selector, we construct a globally unbiased sub-model\nby choosing suitable instrumental variables and nonparametric adjustment. The\nnew estimation of the parameters in the sub-model can be of the asymptotic\nnormality. The consistent estimator, together with the selected sub-model and\nadjusted model, improves model predictions. Simulation studies show that the\nnew approach has the significant improvement of estimation and prediction\naccuracies over the Gaussian Dantzig selector and other classical methods have.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2010 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-10"}
