Overall, the two T dwarf binaries\nstudied here, along with recent results from T dwarfs in age and mass benchmark\nsystems, yield evidence for small (~100 K) errors in the evolutionary models\nand/or model atmospheres, but not significantly larger.

Without a short period orbit about the MW, the origin of the Magellanic\nStream, a young (1-2 Gyr old) coherent stream of HI gas that trails the Clouds\n~150 degrees across the sky, can no longer be attributed to stripping by MW\ntides and/or ram pressure stripping by MW halo gas. We propose an alternative\nformation mechanism in which material is removed by LMC tides acting on the SMC\nbefore the system is accreted by the MW. We demonstrate the feasibility and\ngenerality of this scenario using an N-body/SPH simulation with cosmologically\nmotivated initial conditions constrained by the observations. Under these\nconditions we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the origin of the\nMagellanic Stream in a first infall scenario. This picture is generically\napplicable to any gas-rich dwarf galaxy pair infalling towards a massive host\nor interacting in isolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 20:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A\ndistinction between magnetic and non-magnetic regions is made in TC models,\nwhile assuming a homogeneous distribution of both components. In our TC\ninversions of 59 Vir, we investigate three cases: both components have equal\ntemperatures; warm magnetic regions; cool magnetic regions.

Using structure function, power spectrum and\nautocorrelation function analysis, we investigate the variability of Sgr A* on\ntime scales ranging from a few seconds to several hours and find evidence for\nsub-minute time scale variability at radio wavelengths. These measurements\nsuggest a strong case for continuous variability from sub-minute to hourly time\nscales. This short time scale variability constrains the size of the emitting\nregion to be less than 0.1\\,AU. Assuming that the minute time scale\nfluctuations of the emission at 7\\,mm arise through the expansion of regions of\noptically thick synchrotron-emitting plasma, this suggests the presence of\nexplosive, energetic expansion events at speeds close to $c$. The required rate\nof mass processing and energy loss of this component are estimated to be $\\ga\n6\\times 10^{-10} \\msol$ yr$^{-1}$ and 400\\,$L_\\odot$ respectively. The inferred\nscale length corresponding to one-minute light travel time is comparable to the\ntime averaged spatially resolved 0.1AU scale observed at 1.3mm emission of Sgr\nA*. This steady component from Sgr A* is interpreted mainly as an ensemble\naverage of numerous weak and overlapping flares that are detected on short time\nscales. The nature of such short time scale variable emission or quiescent\nvariability is not understood but could result from fluctuations in the\naccretion flow of Sgr A* that feed the base of an outflow or jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 23:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 06:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Primary aim is to explore the possibility of using data recorded\nby a single imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescope(IACT) for making accurate\nmeasurements of diffuse galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray flux above ~1 TeV\nenergy. Using simulated data of atmospheric Cerenkov images recorded in an\nIACT, initiated both by cosmic ray protons and diffuse gamma-rays with energies\nabove 4 TeV and 2 TeV respectively, we identify the most efficient fractal\n/wavelet parameters of the recorded images for primary identification. The\nmethod is based on the pattern recognition technique and employs fractal and\nwavelet analysis of the recorded Cerenkov images for gamma-hadron segregation.\nWe show that the value of wavelet dimension parameter B6 can segregate Cerenkov\nimages of hadronic origin from those of diffuse gamma-ray origin with almost\n100% accuracy.

The main goal of\nthese observations was to follow the evolution of the remarkable water maser\nlinear/arcuate structures found in earlier VLBI observations. Comparing the\ndata of our new epochs of observation with those observed five years before, we\nfind that at \"large\" scales of > 1\" (700 AU) the main regions of maser emission\npersist, implying that both the surrounding medium and the exciting sources of\nthe masers have been relatively stable during that time span.

R4 traces a nearly\nelliptical patchy ring of ~ 70 mas size (50 AU) with expanding motions of ~ 5\nmas/yr (15 km/s).

We study the statistics of X-ray pulse profiles in order to\nconstrain the neutron star compactness and the magnetic field geometry. We\ncollect the data for 124 X-ray pulsars, which are mainly in high-mass X-ray\nbinary systems, and classify their pulse profiles according to the number of\nobserved peaks seen during one spin period, dividing them into two classes,\nsingle- and double-peaked. We find that the pulsars are distributed about\nequally between both groups. We also compute the probabilities predicted by the\ntheoretical models of two antipodal point-like spots that emit radiation\naccording to the pencil-like emission patterns. These are then compared to the\nobserved fraction of pulsars in the two classes. Assuming a blackbody emission\npattern, it is possible to constrain the neutron star compactness if the\nmagnetic dipole has arbitrary inclinations to the pulsar rotational axis. More\nrealistic pencil-beam patterns predict that 79% of the pulsars are\ndouble-peaked independently of their compactness. The theoretical predictions\ncan be made consistent with the data if the magnetic dipole inclination to the\nrotational axis has an upper limit of 40+/-4 deg. We also discuss the effect of\nlimited sensitivity of the X-ray instruments to detect weak pulses, which\nlowers the number of detected double-peaked profiles and makes the theoretical\npredictions to be consistent with the data even if the magnetic dipole does\nhave random inclinations. This shows that the statistics of pulse profiles does\nnot allow us to constrain the neutron star compactness. In contrast to the\nprevious claims by Bulik et al. (2003), the data also do not require the\nmagnetic inclination to be confined in a narrow interval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 08:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

We adopt an Hamiltonian formalism of the motion of\nrotation of rigid celestial body set up by Kinoshita (1977) based on Andoyer\nvariables and canonical equations. First we calculate Phoebe's obliquity at\nJ2000,0 from available astronomical data as well as the gravitational\nperturbation due to Saturn on Phoebe rotational motion. Then we carry out a\nnumerical integration and we compare our results for the precession rate and\nthe nutation coefficients with pure analytical model. Our results for Phoebe\nobliquity (23{\\deg}95) and Phoebe precession rate (5580\".65/cy) are very close\nto the respective values for the Earth. Moreover the amplitudes of the\nnutations (26\" peak to peak for the nutaton in longitude and 8\" for the\nnutation in obliquity) are of the same order as the respective amplitudes for\nthe Earth. We give complete tables of nutation, obtained from a FFT analysis\nstarting from the numerical signals. We show that a pure analytical model of\nthe nutation is not accurate due to the fact that Phoebe orbital elements e, M\nand Ls are far from having a simple linear behaviour. The precession and\nnutation of Phoebe have been calculated for the first time in this paper.

Surprisingly, even for the cuprates, which is conventionally\nmodeled by a single orbital model, the multiorbital band structure is shown to\nplay a crucial role in the material dependence of superconductivity. In fact,\nby adopting a two orbital model that considers the $d_{z^2}$ orbital on top of\nthe $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we can resolve a long standing puzzle of why the\nsingle layered Hg cuprate have much higher $T_c$ than the La cuprate.\nInterestingly, here again the apical oxygen height measured from the CuO$_2$\nplane plays an important role in determining the relative energy difference\nbetween $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, thereby strongly affecting the\nsuperconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 10:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The simulations mimic the plasma\nemission mechanism and Larmor drift instability in a plasma thread that\nconnects the Sun to Earth with the spatial scales compressed appropriately. The\neffects of spatial density gradients on the generation of electromagnetic\nradiation are investigated. It is shown that 1.5D inhomogeneous plasma with a\nuniform background magnetic field directed transverse to the density gradient\nis aperiodically unstable to Larmor-drift instability. The latter results in a\nnovel effect of generation of electromagnetic emission at plasma frequency.\nWhen density gradient is removed (i.e. when plasma becomes stable to\nLarmor-drift instability) and a $low$ density, super-thermal, hot beam is\ninjected along the domain, in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield, plasma emission mechanism generates non-escaping Langmuir type\noscillations which in turn generate escaping electromagnetic radiation. It is\nfound that in the spatial location where the beam is injected, the standing\nwaves, oscillating at the plasma frequency, are excited.

Two methodologies are\nemployed here. Starting from a laminar flow puffs can be created by locally\ninjecting a jet of fluid through the pipe wall. When the perturbation is\napplied periodically at low frequencies, as expected, a regular sequence of\npuffs is observed where the puff spacing is given by the ratio of the mean flow\nspeed to the perturbation frequency.

The problem of the vibrating rectangular membrane under a stress\ncaused by a uniform in-plane force is well known. However, the resonance\nfrequency behaviour when the force is out-of-plane instead of in-plane, is not\nso well understood and documented. A gradiometer which uses a silicon square\nmembrane with a magnet fixed on it as a sensor head has been developed in a\nprevious work.

Thanks to recent and ongoing large scale surveys, hundreds of brown\ndwarfs have been discovered in the last decade.

Our objectives\nare to find ultracool brown dwarfs and to constrain the field brown-dwarf\nluminosity function and the mass function from a large and homogeneous sample\nof L and T dwarfs. Methods. We identify candidates in CFHT/MegaCam i' and z'\nimages and follow them up with pointed near infrared (NIR) imaging on several\ntelescopes. Halfway through our survey we found ~50 T dwarfs and ~170 L or\nultra cool M dwarfs drawn from a larger sample of 1400 candidates with typical\nultracool dwarfs i' - z' colours, found in 780 square degrees. Results. We have\ncurrently completed the NIR follow-up on a large part of the survey for all\ncandidates from mid-L dwarfs down to the latest T dwarfs known with utracool\ndwarfs' colours. This allows us to draw on a complete and well defined sample\nof 102 ultracool dwarfs to investigate the luminosity function and space\ndensity of field dwarfs. Conclusions. We found the density of late L5 to T0\ndwarfs to be 2.0pm0.8 x 10-3 objects pc-3, the density of T0.5 to T5.5 dwarfs\nto be 1.4pm0.3 x 10-3 objects pc-3, and the density of T6 to T8 dwarfs to be\n5.3pm3.1 x 10-3 objects pc-3 .

Specifically, our\nresults can be reproduced by an unspotted stellar photosphere with Teff=2700K\nand (empirical) logg=3.5, coupled with axisymmetric cool spots that are 15%\ncooler (2300K), have an effective logg=3.0 (0.5 dex lower than photospheric),\nand cover 70% of the surface. On the other hand, the trends in our analysis can\nalso be reproduced by model opacity errors: there are lacks in the synthetic\nTiO-epsilon opacities, at least for higher-gravity field dwarfs. Stringently\ndiscriminating between the two possibilities requires combining the present\nresults with an equivalent analysis of the secondary (predicted to be\nrelatively unspotted compared to the primary).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 12:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In a \"power-stroke\" model the observed independence\nof the speed at low load on the number of stators is explained by a\ntorque-dependent stepping mechanism independent of the strength of the stator\ntethering spring. On the other hand, in models that depend solely on the stator\nspring to explain the observed behavior, exceedingly small stator spring\nconstants are required. To study the dynamics of the motor driven by external\nforces (such as those exerted by an optical tweezer), back-stepping is\nintroduced when stators are driven far out of equilibrium. Our model with\nback-stepping reproduces the observed absence of a barrier to backward\nrotation, as well the behaviors in the high-speed negative-torque regime.\nRecently measured temperature dependence of the motor speed near zero load\n(Yuan & Berg 2010 Biophys J) is explained quantitatively by the thermally\nactivated stepping rates in our model. Finally, we suggest that the general\nmechanical properties of all molecular motors (linear and rotary),\ncharacterized by their force(torque)-speed curve, can be determined by their\npower-stroke potentials and the dependence of the stepping rates on the\nmechanical state of the motor (force or speed). The torque-speed curve for the\nclockwise rotating flagellar motor has been observed for the first time\nrecently (Yuan et al. 2010 PNAS). Its quasi-linear behavior is quantitatively\nreproduced by our model. In particular, we show that concave and convex shapes\nof the torque-speed curve can be achieved by changing the interaction potential\nfrom linear to quadratic form. We also show that reversing the stepping rate\ndependence on force (torque) can lead to non-monotonicity in the speed-load\ndependency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 14:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-16"}

We find that the low-luminosity,\nFRI-type, radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with the local\nFundamental Plane of radio galaxies defined by Bettoni et al. when corrected\nfor simple passive evolution of their stellar populations. However, we find\nthat the higher luminosity, FRII-type radio galaxies are inconsistent with the\nlocal Fundamental Plane if only passive evolution is considered, and find\nevidence for a rotation in the Fundamental Plane at z~0.5 when compared with\nthe local relation. We show that neither passive evolution, nor a\nmass-dependent evolution in the mass-to-light ratio, nor an evolution in the\nsize of the host galaxies can, by themselves, plausibly explain the observed\ntilt. However, we suggest that some combination of all three effects, with size\nevolution as the dominant factor, may be sufficient to explain the difference\nbetween the planes. We also find evidence for a correlation between host galaxy\nvelocity dispersion and radio luminosity at the 97% significance level within\nour sub-sample, although further observations are required in order to\ndetermine whether this is different for the FRI and FRII radio sources.\nAssuming that the M_BH - sigma relation still holds at z~0.5, this implies that\nradio luminosity scales with black hole mass, in agreement with previous\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 15:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

At\neach time slot the server decides either to stay with the current queue or\nswitch to the other queue based on the current connectivity and the queue\nlength information. The introduction of switchover time is a new modeling\ncomponent of this problem, which makes the problem much more challenging. We\ndevelop a novel approach to characterize the stability region of the system by\nusing state action frequencies, which are stationary solutions to a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) formulation of the corresponding saturated system. We\ncharacterize the stability region explicitly in terms of the connectivity\nparameters and develop a frame-based dynamic control (FBDC) policy that is\nshown to be throughput-optimal. In fact, the FBDC policy provides a new\nframework for developing throughput-optimal network control policies using\nstate action frequencies. Furthermore, we develop simple Myopic policies that\nachieve more than 96% of the stability region. Finally, simulation results show\nthat the Myopic policies may achieve the full stability region and are more\ndelay efficient than the FBDC policy in most cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 15:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-16"}
