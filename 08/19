The extended devices\nare represented explicitly in space with 15 million atom structures.

Utilizing the damped\nrandom walk model of Kelly et al. (2009), we parameterize the ensemble quasar\nstructure function in Sloan Stripe 82 as a function of observed brightness. The\nensemble model fit can then be evaluated rigorously for and calibrated with\nindividual light curves with no parameter fitting. This yields a classification\nin two statistics --- one describing the fit confidence and one describing the\nprobability of a false alarm --- which can be tuned, a priori, to achieve high\nquasar detection fractions (99% completeness with default cuts), given an\nacceptable rate of false alarms. We establish the typical rate of false alarms\ndue to known variable stars as <3% (high purity). Applying the classification,\nwe increase the sample of potential quasars relative to those known in Stripe\n82 by as much as 29%, and by nearly a factor of two in the redshift range\n2.5<z<3, where selection by color is extremeley inefficient. This represents\n1875 new quasars in a 290 deg^2 field.

However, this interpretation is based on the assumption that the spins\nof young stars are parallel to the rotation axes of protostellar discs around\nthem. We show that the interaction between a magnetic star and its\ncircumstellar disc can (but not always) have the effect of pushing the stellar\nspin axis away from the disc angular momentum axis toward the perpendicular\nstate and even the retrograde state. Planets formed in the disc may therefore\nhave their orbital axes misaligned with the stellar spin axis, even before any\nadditional planet-planet scatterings or Kozai interactions take place.

The accuracy of the conversion from line strengths to physical\nproperties depends upon the accuracy to which the lines can be corrected for\ndust attenuation. For studies of single galaxies with normal amounts of dust,\nmost dust corrections result in the same derived properties within the errors.\nHowever, for statistical studies of populations of galaxies, or for studies of\ngalaxies with higher dust contents such as might be found in some classes of\n\"transition\" galaxies, significant uncertainty arises from the dust attenuation\ncorrection. We compare the strength of the predominantly unobscured mid-IR\n[NeII]15.5um + [NeIII]12.8um emission lines to the optical H alpha emission\nlines in four samples of galaxies: (i) ordinary star forming galaxies, (ii)\noptically selected dusty galaxies, (iii) ULIRGs, (iv) Seyfert 2 galaxies. We\nshow that a single dust attenuation curve applied to all samples can correct H\nalpha emission for dust attenuation to a factor better than 2. Similarly, we\ncompare mid-IR [OIV] and optical [OIII] luminosities to find that [OIII] can be\ncorrected to a factor better than 3. This shows that the total dust attenuation\nsuffered by the AGN narrow line region is not significantly different to that\nsuffered by the starforming HII regions in the galaxy. We provide explicit dust\nattenuation corrections, together with errors, for [OII], [OIII] and H alpha.\nThe best-fit average attenuation curve is slightly greyer than the Milky-Way\nextinction law, indicating either that external galaxies have slightly\ndifferent typical dust properties to the Milky Way, or that there is a\nsignificant contribution from scattering. Finally, we uncover an intriguing\ncorrelation between Silicate absorption and Balmer decrement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Compared\nto its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with\ncondensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This\nfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred\nmore efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.\nFurthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance\npatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent\nstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this\nobservational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar\nanalogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a\nplanet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results\nare averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the\nabundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with\nTc. A trend with FIP would suggest a different origin for the abundance\npatterns found, but we show that the correlation with Tc is statistically more\nsignificant. We encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogs\nand late F-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formation\nsignature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. Finally,\nwe examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two stars\nhosting super-Earth like planets contradict the planet formation signature\nhypothesis. Instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two stars\nare fully compatible with our hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 20:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

If one can\nfit and subtract away the continuum emission with a smooth function of\nfrequency, the remaining signal contains fluctuations of flux with frequency\nand angle from line emitting galaxies. Over a particular small range of\nobserved frequencies, these fluctuations will originate from sources\ncorresponding to a series of different redshifts, one for each emission line.\nIt is possible to statistically isolate the fluctuations at a particular\nredshift by cross correlating emission originating from the same redshift, but\nin different emission lines. This technique will allow detection of clustering\nfluctuations from the faintest galaxies which individually cannot be detected,\nbut which contribute substantially to the total signal due to their large\nnumbers. We describe these fluctuations quantitatively through the line cross\npower spectrum. As an example of a particular application of this technique, we\ncalculate the signal-to-noise ratio for a measurement of the cross power\nspectrum of the OI(63 micron) and OIII(52 micron) fine structure lines with the\nproposed Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics. We find that\nthe cross power spectrum can be measured beyond a redshift of z=8. Such\nobservations could constrain the evolution of the metallicity, bias, and duty\ncycle of faint galaxies at high redshifts and may also be sensitive to the\nreionization history through its effect on the minimum mass of galaxies. As\nanother example, we consider the cross power spectrum of CO line emission\nmeasured with a large ground based telescope like CCAT and 21-cm radiation\noriginating from hydrogen in galaxies after reionization with an interferometer\nsimilar in scale to MWA, but optimized for post-reionization redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 21:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 17:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The radial expansion of the gradually cooling\nphotosphere gives rise to a near-constant luminosity up to >~100d after\nexplosion. The photosphere remains in the outer 0.5Msun of the ejecta for up to\n~50d after explosion. As the photosphere reaches the edge of the helium core,\nthe SN luminosity drops by an amount mitigated by the progenitor radius and the\n56Ni mass. Synthetic light-curves exhibit a bell-shape morphology, evolving\nfaster for more compact progenitors, and with an earlier peak and narrower\nwidth in bluer filters. UV and U-band fluxes are very sensitive to\nline-blanketing, the metallicity, and the adopted model atoms. During the\nrecombination epoch synthetic spectra are dominated by HI and metal lines, and\nare largely insensitive to the differing H/He/C/N/O composition of our two\nprogenitor stars. In contrast, synthetic nebular-phase spectra reveal a\nbroader/stronger OI doublet line in the higher-mass progenitor model,\nreflecting the larger masses of oxygen and nickel that are ejected. Our\nsimulations overestimate the typical luminosity and the visual rise time of\nstandard SNe II-P, likely a consequence of our progenitor stars being too big\nand/or too hydrogen rich. Comparison of our simulations with photospheric-phase\nobservations of SN1999em of the same color are satisfactory. Our neglect of\nnon-thermal processes leads to a fast disappearance of continuum radiation and\nBalmer-line emission at the end of the plateau phase. With the exception of HI\nlines, our nebular spectra show a striking similarity to contemporaneous\nobservations of SN1999em.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 08:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We address the problem of optimal relay positioning and power\nallocations at source and relay, to maximize the multicast rate from source to\nall destinations. To solve such a network planning problem, we develop a\nthree-faceted approach based on an underlying information theoretic model,\ncomputational geometric aspects, and network optimization tools. Firstly,\nassuming superposition coding and frequency division between the source and the\nrelay, the information theoretic framework yields a hypergraph model of the\nwideband BRC, which captures the dependency of achievable rate-tuples on the\nnetwork topology. As the relay position varies, so does the set of hyperarcs\nconstituting the hypergraph, rendering the combinatorial nature of optimization\nproblem. We show that the convex hull C of all nodes in the 2-D plane can be\ndivided into disjoint regions corresponding to distinct hyperarcs sets. These\nsets are obtained by superimposing all k-th order Voronoi tessellation of C. We\npropose an easy and efficient algorithm to compute all hyperarc sets, and prove\nthey are polynomially bounded. Using the switched hypergraph approach, we model\nthe original problem as a continuous yet non-convex network optimization\nprogram.

Also, BH accretion and feedback can strongly modify the\norbit of recoiled BHs and hence their return timescale, besides affecting the\ndistribution of gas and stars in the galactic centre. However, the dynamical\ninteraction of kicked BHs with the surrounding medium is in general complex and\ncan facilitate both a fast return to the centre as well as a significant delay.\nThe Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rates of the recoiling BHs in our simulated\ngalaxies are favourably high for the detection of off-centred AGN if kicked\nwithin gas-rich discs -- up to a few per cent of the Eddington accretion rate\n-- and are highly variable on timescales of a few 10^7 yrs. In major merger\nsimulations of gas-rich galaxies, we find that gravitational recoils increase\nthe scatter in the BH mass -- host galaxy relationships compared to simulations\nwithout kicks, with the BH mass being more sensitive to recoil kicks than the\nbulge mass. A generic result of our numerical models is that the clumpy massive\ndiscs suggested by recent high-redshift observations, as well as the remnants\nof gas-rich mergers, exhibit a gravitational potential that falls steeply in\nthe central regions, due to the dissipative concentration of baryons. As a\nresult, supermassive BHs should only rarely be able to escape from massive\ngalaxies at high redshifts, which is the epoch where the bulk of BH recoils is\nexpected to occur.[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 14:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 20:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The calculation\nresults indicate that the spin of small body should be considered in\nwaveform-template production for the upcoming gravitational wave detections.

The global reconnection rate is shown to be\nindependent of the Lundquist number. The distribution of fluxes in the\nplasmoids is shown to be an inverse square law. It is argued that there is a\nfinite probability of emergence of abnormally large plasmoids, which can\ndisrupt the chain (and may be responsible for observable large abrupt events in\nsolar flares and sawtooth crashes). A criterion for the transition from\nmagnetohydrodynamic to collisionless regime is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 15:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
