The\nmorphological and spectral properties of these sources suggest that the\nemitting electrons are accelerated by spatially distributed and gentle\nmechanisms, providing some indirect evidence for turbulent acceleration in the\ninter-galactic-medium (IGM). Only deep upper limits to the energy associated\nwith relativistic protons in the IGM have been recently obtained through gamma\nand radio observations. Yet these protons should be (theoretically) the main\nnon-thermal particle component in the IGM implying the unavoidable production,\nat some level, of secondary particles that may have a deep impact on the gamma\nray and radio properties of galaxy clysters. Following Brunetti and Lazarian\n(2007), in this paper we consider the advances in the theory of MHD turbulence\nto develop a comprehensive picture of turbulence in the IGM and extend our\nprevious calculations of particle acceleration by compressible MHD turbulence\nby considering self-consistently the reacceleration of both primary and\nsecondary particles. Under these conditions we expect that radio to gamma ray\nemission is generated from galaxy clusters with a complex spectrum that depends\non the dynamics of the thermal gas and Dark Matter. The non-thermal emission\nresults in very good agreement with radio observations and with present\nconstraints from hard X-ray and gamma ray observations. In our model giant\nradio halos are generated in merging (turbulent) clusters only. However, in\ncase secondaries dominate the electron component in the IGM, we expect that the\nlevel of the Mpc-scale synchrotron emission in more relaxed clusters is already\nclose to that of the radio upper limits derived by present observations of\nclusters without radio halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 16:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that the\nentropy profile of non-radiative simulations is produced by a mechanism of\n\"sorting in entropy\" which takes place with regularity during the cluster\nevolution.

Importantly, they have readily modifiable interlayer spaces that\nprovide excellent sites for nanochemistry. Vermiculite is one such smectite\nclay and in the presence of small chain-length alkyl-NH3Cl ions, forms\nsensitive, 1-D ordered model clay systems with expandable nano-pore inter-layer\nregions. These inter-layers readily adsorb organic molecules. N-propyl NH3Cl\nvermiculite clay gels were used to determine the adsorption of alanine, lysine\nand histidine by chiral HPLC. The results show that during reaction with fresh\nvermiculite interlayers, significant chiral enrichment of either L- and\nD-enantiomers occurs depending on the amino acid. Chiral enrichment of the\nsupernatant solutions is up to about 1% per pass. In contrast, addition to clay\ninterlayers already reacted with amino acid solutions resulted in little or no\nchange in D/L ratio during the time of the experiment. Adsorption of small\namounts of amphiphilic organic molecules in clay inter-layers is known to\nproduce Layer-by-Layer or Langmuir-Blodgett films. Moreover atomistic\nsimulations show that self-organization of organic species in clay interlayers\nis important. These non-centrosymmetric, chirally active nanofilms may cause\nclays to act subsequently as chiral amplifiers, concentrating organic material\nfrom dilute solution and having different adsorption energetics for D- and\nL-enantiomers. The additional role of clays in RNA oligimerization already\npostulated by Ferris and others, together with the need for the organization of\namphiphilic molecules and lipids noted by Szostak and others, suggests that\nsuch chiral separation by clays in lagoonal environments at normal biological\ntemperatures might also have played a significant role in the origin of\nbiochirality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 21:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 11:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

There has been a flurry of recent research studying Nash\nbargaining solutions (also called 'balanced outcomes') in bargaining networks,\nso that we now know when such solutions exist, and also that they can be\ncomputed efficiently, even by market agents behaving in a natural manner. In\nthis work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the\npossibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'. This generalization was introduced\nin [KB+10], where it was shown that the corresponding 'unequal division' (UD)\nsolutions exist if and only if Nash bargaining solutions exist, and also that a\ncertain local dynamics converges to UD solutions when they exist. However, the\nbound on convergence time obtained for that dynamics was exponential in network\nsize for the unequal division case. This bound is tight, in the sense that\nthere exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after\nexponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do\nnot generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational\ntractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an\nFPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist. On a\ngraph G=(V,E) with weights (i.e. pairwise profit opportunities) uniformly\nbounded above by 1, our FPTAS finds an \\eps-UD solution in time\npoly(|V|,1/\\eps). We also provide a fast local algorithm for finding \\eps-UD\nsolution, providing further justification that a market can find such a\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 23:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-02"}

The intended receiver is assumed to have a certain minimum SNR and\nthe eavesdropper is assumed to have a strictly lower SNR compared to the\nintended receiver. The objective is minimizing the distortion of source\nreconstruction at the intended receiver. In this work, it is shown that unlike\nthe Gaussian wiretap channel without side information, Shannon's source-channel\nseparation coding scheme is not optimum in the sense of achieving the minimum\ndistortion. Three hybrid digital-analog secure joint source channel coding\nschemes are then proposed which achieve the minimum distortion. The first\ncoding scheme is based on Costa's dirty paper coding scheme and wiretap channel\ncoding scheme when the analog source is not explicitly quantized. The second\ncoding scheme is based on the superposition of the secure digital signal and\nthe hybrid digital-analog signal. It is shown that for the problem of\ncommunicating a Gaussian source over a Gaussian wiretap channel with side\ninformation, there exists an infinite family of optimum secure joint\nsource-channel coding scheme. In the third coding scheme, the quantized signal\nand the analog error signal are explicitly superimposed. It is shown that this\nscheme provides an infinite family of optimum secure joint source-channel\nchannel coding schemes with a variable number of binning. Finally, the proposed\nsecure hybrid digital-analog schemes are analyzed under the main channel SNR\nmismatch. It is proven that the proposed schemes can give a graceful\ndegradation of distortion with SNR under SNR mismatch, i.e., when the actual\nSNR is larger than the designed SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 04:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

In\nthis paper, a bifurcation structure of the infinite dimensional Kuramoto model\nis investigated. For a certain non-selfadjoint linear operator, which defines a\nlinear part of the Kuramoto model, the spectral theory on a space of\ngeneralized functions is developed with the aid of a rigged Hilbert space to\navoid a continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. Although the linear operator\nhas an unbounded continuous spectrum on a Hilbert space, it is shown that it\nadmits a spectral decomposition consisting of a countable number of\neigenfunctions on a space of generalized functions. The semigroup generated by\nthe linear operator is calculated by using the spectral decomposition to prove\nthe linear stability of a steady state of the system. The center manifold\ntheory is also developed on a space of generalized functions. It is proved that\nthere exists a finite dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized\nfunctions, while a center manifold on a Hilbert space is of infinite\ndimensional because of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. The\nresults are applied to the stability and bifurcation theory of the Kuramoto\nmodel to obtain a bifurcation diagram conjectured by Kuramoto. If the coupling\nstrength $K$ between oscillators is smaller than some threshold $K_c$, the\nde-synchronous state proves to be asymptotically stable, and if $K$ exceeds\n$K_c$, a nontrivial solution, which corresponds to the synchronization,\nbifurcates from the de-synchronous state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 08:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 10:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

These are\nmechanisms that guarantee optimal utility to a large class of information\nconsumers, simultaneously, while preserving Differential Privacy [Dwork,\nMcSherry, Nissim, and Smith, TCC 2006]. Ghosh et al. have demonstrated, quite\nsurprisingly, a case where such a universally-optimal differentially-private\nmechanisms exists, when the information consumers are Bayesian. This result was\nrecently extended by Gupte and Sundararajan [PODS 2010] to risk-averse\nconsumers.\n  Both positive results deal with mechanisms (approximately) computing a single\ncount query (i.e., the number of individuals satisfying a specific property in\na given population), and the starting point of our work is a trial at extending\nthese results to similar settings, such as sum queries with non-binary\nindividual values, histograms, and two (or more) count queries. We show,\nhowever, that universally-optimal mechanisms do not exist for all these\nqueries, both for Bayesian and risk-averse consumers.\n  For the Bayesian case, we go further, and give a characterization of those\nfunctions that admit universally-optimal mechanisms, showing that a\nuniversally-optimal mechanism exists, essentially, only for a (single) count\nquery. At the heart of our proof is a representation of a query function $f$ by\nits privacy constraint graph $G_f$ whose edges correspond to values resulting\nby applying $f$ to neighboring databases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 09:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

However, observational evidence for the\nexistence of such outer cool disks in these nuclei is rather poor. Instead,\nrecent observations sometimes suggest the existence of inner cool disks of\nnon-standard type, which develop in the region very close to their central\nblack holes. Taking NGC 4261 as a typical example of such light eating nuclei,\nfor which both flux data ranging from radio to X-ray and data for the\ncounterjet occultation are available, we examine the plausibility of such a\npicture for the accretion states as mentioned above, based on model\npredictions. It is shown that the explanation of the gap seen in the counterjet\nemission in terms of the free-free absorption by an outer standard disk is\nunrealistic, and moreover, the existence itself of such an outer standard disk\nseems very implausible. Instead, the model of RIAF in an ordered magnetic field\n(so called resistive RIAF model) can well serve to explain the emission gap in\nterms of the synchrotron absorption, as well as to reproduce the observed\nfeatures of the overall spectral energy distribution (SED). This model also\npredicts that the RIAF state starts directly from an interstellar hot gas phase\nat around the Bondi radius and terminates at the inner edge whose radius is\nabout 100 times the Schwartzschild radii. Therefore, there is a good\npossibility for a cool disk to develop within this innermost region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 14:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

When $\\lambda^2=1$, the generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual\ncodes of such codes are determined together with necessary and sufficient\nconditions for them to be Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual.

This allows us to express\ngenerators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of skew cyclic and skew\nnegacyclic codes in terms of the generators of the original codes.

The fluid is also taken to\nbe electrically conducting (in the low magnetic Reynolds number limit), and a\nmagnetic field is imposed parallel to the axis of rotation. If the outer sphere\nis stationary, the magnetic field induces a Shercliffe layer on the tangent\ncylinder, the cylinder just touching the inner sphere and parallel to the\nfield. If the magnetic field is absent, but a strong overall rotation is\npresent, Coriolis effects induce a Stewartson layer on the tangent cylinder.\nThe non-axisymmetric instabilities of both types of layer separately have been\nstudied before; here we consider the two cases side by side, as well as the\nmixed case, and investigate how magnetic and rotational effects interact. We\nfind that if the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the same\ndirection, the overall rotation may have a destabilizing influence, whereas if\nthe differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the opposite\ndirection, the overall rotation always has a stabilizing influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 15:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

In addition to this destructive effect, tidal forces can morph\ninto a transient, protective setting called compressive mode. Such modes then\nshelter the matter in their midst by increasing its gravitational binding\nenergy. This thesis focuses on the study of this poorly known regime by\nquantifying its properties thanks to numerical and analytical tools applied to\na spectacular merging system of two galaxies, commonly known as the Antennae\ngalaxies. N-body simulations of this pair yield compressive modes in the\nregions where observations reveal a burst of star formation. Furthermore,\ncharacteristic time- and energy scales of these modes match well those of\nself-gravitating substructures such as star clusters and tidal dwarf galaxies.\nThese results suggest that the compressive modes of tidal fields plays an\nimportant role in the formation and evolution of young clusters, at least in a\nstatistical sense, over a lapse of ~10 million years. Preliminary results from\nsimulations of stellar associations highlight the importance of embedding the\nclusters in the evolving background galaxies to account precisely for their\nmorphology and internal evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 15:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}
