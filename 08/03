In this paper we report a detailed comparison between three prominent\napproaches to quantum transport: the fourth-order Bloch-Redfield quantum master\nequation (BR), the real-time diagrammatic technique (RT), and the scattering\nrate approach based on the T-matrix (TM). Central to the BR and RT is the\ngeneralized master equation for the reduced density matrix. We demonstrate the\nexact equivalence of these two techniques. By accounting for coherences\n(nondiagonal elements of the density matrix) between nonsecular states, we show\nhow contributions to the transport kernels can be grouped in a physically\nmeaningful way. This not only significantly reduces the numerical cost of\nevaluating the kernels but also yields expressions similar to those obtained in\nthe TM approach, allowing for a detailed comparison. However, in the TM\napproach an ad hoc regularization procedure is required to cure spurious\ndivergences in the expressions for the transition rates in the stationary\n(zero-frequency) limit. We show that these problems derive from incomplete\ncancellation of reducible contributions and do not occur in the BR and RT\ntechniques, resulting in well-behaved expressions in the latter two cases.\nAdditionally, we show that a standard regularization procedure of the TM rates\nemployed in the literature does not correctly reproduce the BR and RT\nexpressions. All the results apply to general quantum dot models and we present\nexplicit rules for the simplified calculation of the zero-frequency kernels.\nAlthough we focus on fourth-order perturbation theory only, the results and\nimplications generalize to higher orders.

We\nadapt the approach of Neyrinck et al. (2009) to lensing by using a modified\nlogarithmic transform of the convergence field. The Fourier transform of the\nlog-transformed field has modes that are nearly uncorrelated, which allows for\nadditional cosmological information to be extracted from small-scale modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 16:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

The analysis is based on high-resolution\noptical spectra from the McDonald Observatory and the Special Astrophysical\nObservatory. Standard analysis using a classical Kurucz model atmosphere and\nthe line analysis program MOOG provides the atmospheric parameters: Teff = 6500\nK, log g = +0.5, and a microturbulent velocity Vt = 4.7 km/s and [Fe/H] = -0.9.\nExtraction of these parameters is based on excitation of FeI lines, ionization\nequilibrium between neutral and ions of Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe, and the wings\nof hydrogen Paschen lines. Elemental abundances are obtained for 22 elements\nand upper limits for an additional four elements. These results show that the\nstar's atmosphere has not experienced a significant number of C- and s-process\nenriching thermal pulses. Abundance anomalies as judged relative to the\ncompositions of unevolved and less-evolved normal stars of a similar\nmetallicity include Al, Y, and Zr deficiencies with respect to Fe of about 0.5\ndex. Judged by composition, the star resembles a RV Tauri variable that has\nbeen mildly affected by dust-gas separation reducing the abundances of the\nelements of highest condensation temperature. This separation may occur in the\nstellar wind. There are indications that the standard 1D LTE analysis is not\nentirely appropriate for IRAS 18095+2704.

We shall focus on\nthe specific case of two generally dissimilar plane-parallel slabs, which\ninteract across vacuum or an arbitrary intervening dielectric medium. Monopolar\ncharge disorder is considered to be present on the bounding surfaces and/or in\nthe bulk of the slabs, may be in general quenched or annealed and may possess a\nfinite lateral correlation length reflecting possible `patchiness' of the\nrandom charge distribution. In the case of quenched disorder, the bulk disorder\nis shown to give rise to an additive long-range contribution to the total\nforce, which decays as the inverse distance between the slabs and may be\nattractive or repulsive depending on the dielectric constants of the slabs. We\nshow that in the case of two dissimilar slabs the net effect due to the\ninterplay between the disorder-induced and the pure van der Waals interactions\ncan lead to a variety of unusual non-monotonic interaction profiles between the\ndielectric slabs. In particular, when the intervening medium has a larger\ndielectric constant than the two slabs, we find that the net interaction can\nbecome repulsive and exhibit a potential barrier, while the underlying van der\nWaals force is attractive. On the contrary, when the intervening medium has a\ndielectric constant in between that of the two slabs, the net interaction can\nbecome attractive and exhibit a free energy minimum, while the pure van der\nWaals force is repulsive. Therefore, the charge disorder, if present, can\ndrastically alter the effective interaction between net-neutral objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 18:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In such models the fundamental physics\nwhich leads to, e.g., field localization, orbifolding, the existence of brane\nterms and the compactification process all can introduce LIV in the higher\ndimensional theory while still preserving 4-d Lorentz invariance. In this\npaper, attempting to capture some of this physics, we extend our previous\nanalysis of LIV in 5-d UED-type models to those with 5-d warped extra\ndimensions. To be specific, we employ the 5-d analog of the SM Extension of\nKostelecky et. al. ~which incorporates a complete set of operators arising from\nspontaneous LIV. We show that while the response of the bulk scalar, fermion\nand gauge fields to the addition of LIV operators in warped models is\nqualitatively similar to what happens in the flat 5-d UED case, the gravity\nsector of these models reacts very differently than in flat space.\nSpecifically, we show that LIV in this warped case leads to a non-zero bulk\nmass for the 5-d graviton and so the would-be zero mode, which we identify as\nthe usual 4-d graviton, must necessarily become massive. The origin of this\nmass term is the simultaneous existence of the constant non-zero $AdS_5$\ncurvature and the loss of general co-ordinate invariance via LIV in the 5-d\ntheory. Thus warped 5-d models with LIV in the gravity sector are not\nphenomenologically viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 19:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 20:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 18:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-22"}

The discovery\nof a massive, metal-enriched gas reservoir in a SMG at the heart of a large\nz=5.3 protocluster considerably enhances our understanding of early massive\ngalaxy formation, pushing back to a cosmic epoch where the Universe was less\nthan 1/12 of its present age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 19:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}

We find\nthat, contrary to the common expectation, a magnetic field of strength in the\nobserved range decreases, rather than increases, the characteristic stellar\nmass. It (1) reduces the number of intermediate-mass stars that are formed\nthrough direct turbulent compression, because sub-regions of the clump with\nmasses comparable to those of stars are typically magnetically subcritical and\ncannot be compressed directly into collapse, and (2) increases the number of\nlow-mass stars that are produced from the fragmentation of dense filaments. The\nfilaments result from mass accumulation along the field lines. In order to\nbecome magnetically supercritical and fragment, the filament must accumulate a\nlarge enough column density (proportional to the field strength), which yields\na high volume density (and thus a small thermal Jeans mass) that is conducive\nto forming low-mass stars.

By\nrequiring simultaneous thermal and (vertical) dynamical equilibrium in the\ndiffuse gas, and star formation at a rate proportional to the mass of the\nself-gravitating component, we obtain a prediction for Sigma_SFR as a function\nof the total gaseous surface density Sigma and the density of stars + dark\nmatter, rho_sd. The physical basis of this relationship is that thermal\npressure in the diffuse ISM, which is proportional to the UV heating rate and\ntherefore to Sigma_SFR, must adjust to match the midplane pressure set by the\nvertical gravitational field. Our model applies to regions where Sigma < 100\nMsun/pc^2. In low-Sigma_SFR (outer-galaxy) regions where diffuse gas dominates,\nthe theory predicts Sigma_SFR \\propto Sigma (rho_sd)^1/2. The decrease of\nthermal equilibrium pressure when Sigma_SFR is low implies, consistent with\nobservations, that star formation can extend (with declining efficiency) to\nlarge radii in galaxies, rather than having a sharp cutoff. The main parameters\nentering our model are the ratio of thermal pressure to total pressure in the\ndiffuse ISM, the fraction of diffuse gas that is in the warm phase, and the\nstar formation timescale in self-gravitating clouds; all of these are (in\nprinciple) direct observables. At low surface density, our model depends on the\nratio of the mean midplane FUV intensity (or thermal pressure in the diffuse\ngas) to the star formation rate, which we set based on Solar neighborhood\nvalues.

It is postulated that wear is related to irreversible\nentropy generation within the MAZ. We present a model, that treats the MAZ as a\nheat engine in the Carnot sense. The model assumes that the MAZ is a heat\nengine that transports heat from a high temperature reservoir, represented by\nthe asperity contact layer, to a low temperature reservoir, represented by the\nsub-contact layer. Consequently an entropy generation source that represents\nthe irreversibilities within the MAZ is defined and a study of the entropy\ngeneration is attempted. Wear data, published elsewhere, of two materials,\nOxygen Free High conductivity Copper, and Commercially Pure Titanium are\nanalyzed using the developed model. It is found that wear for both materials is\ncorrelated to entropy generation, and to the entropy flow within the MAZ.\nInterestingly, moreover, in view of the contrasting wear trends of the test\nmaterials, the relationship of the mass wear rate and the specific wear rate of\neach material with respect to entropy generation are totally opposite to each\nother. A common feature between the behavior of the two materials, was found in\nwear behavior with respect to a so called Ratio of Residual Entropy. This ratio\ndetermines wether the system is over or under supplied with entropy. It is\nfound that when the capacity to transport entropy exceeds the entropy supply\nthe mass wear rate increases, and when the entropy transport capacity of the\nsystem is exceeded and entropy generation takes place the mass wear rate\ndecreases. This is attributed to the re-establishment of equilibrium within the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 21:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-04"}

This code bridges\nthe gap between the five-qubit (perfect) and Steane codes. We discuss two\nmethods to encode one qubit into six physical qubits. Each of the two examples\ncorrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. The first example is a degenerate\nsix-qubit quantum error-correcting code. We prove that a six-qubit code without\nentanglement assistance cannot simultaneously possess a Calderbank-Shor-Steane\n(CSS) stabilizer and correct an arbitrary single-qubit error. A corollary of\nthis result is that the Steane seven-qubit code is the smallest single-error\ncorrecting CSS code. Our second example is the construction of a non-degenerate\nsix-qubit CSS entanglement-assisted code. This code uses one bit of\nentanglement (an ebit) shared between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob)\nand corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. In the second half of this thesis\nwe explore the yet uncharted and relatively undiscovered area of quantum\nsteganography. Steganography is the process of hiding secret information by\nembedding it in an innocent message. We present protocols for hiding quantum\ninformation in a codeword of a quantum error-correcting code passing through a\nchannel. Using either a shared classical secret key or shared entanglement\nAlice disguises her information as errors in the channel. Bob can retrieve the\nhidden information, but an eavesdropper (Eve) with the power to monitor the\nchannel, but without the secret key, cannot distinguish the message from\nchannel noise. We analyze how difficult it is for Eve to detect the presence of\nsecret messages, and estimate rates of steganographic communication and secret\nkey consumption for certain protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 23:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-04"}

To address the freshness-cost problem, we formulate the refresh\nscheduling problem with a generic cost model and use this cost model to\ndetermine an optimal refresh frequency that gives the best tradeoff between\nrefresh cost and content freshness. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an\noptimal refresh frequency under the assumptions that the arrival of content\nupdate is Poisson and the age-related cost monotonically increases with\ndecreasing freshness. In addition, we provide an analytic comparison of system\nperformance under fixed refresh scheduling and random refresh scheduling,\nshowing that with the same average refresh frequency two refresh schedulings\nare mathematically equivalent in terms of the long-run average cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 02:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

The magnetic free energy of the model\nactive region varies in time due to a prescribed (deterministic) rate of energy\ninput and prescribed (random) flare jumps downwards in energy. The model has\nbeen shown to reproduce observed flare statistics, for specific\ntime-independent choices for the energy input and flare transition rates.\nHowever, many solar active regions exhibit time variation in flare\nproductivity, as exemplified by NOAA active region AR 11029 (Wheatland 2010).\nIn this case a time-dependent model is needed. Time variation is incorporated\nfor two cases: 1. a step change in the rates of flare jumps; and 2. a step\nchange in the rate of energy supply to the system. Analytic arguments are\npresented describing the qualitative behavior of the system in the two cases.\nIn each case the system adjusts by shifting to a new stationary state over a\nrelaxation time which is estimated analytically. The new model retains\nflare-like event statistics. In each case the frequency-energy distribution is\na power law for flare energies less than a time-dependent rollover set by the\nlargest energy the system is likely to attain at a given time. For Case 1, the\nmodel exhibits a double exponential waiting-time distribution, corresponding to\nflaring at a constant mean rate during two intervals (before and after the step\nchange), if the average energy of the system is large. For Case 2 the\nwaiting-time distribution is a simple exponential, again provided the average\nenergy of the system is large. Monte Carlo simulations of Case~1 are presented\nwhich confirm the analytic estimates. The simulation results provide a\nqualitative model for observed flare statistics in active region AR 11029.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 04:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Because asymmetric eccentricity damping\ndue to disk-planet interaction on the innermost planet at the disk edge plays a\ncrucial role in the trap, this mechanism requires continuous eccentricity\nexcitation and hence works for a resonantly interacting convoy of planets. This\ntrap is so strong that the edge torque exerted on the innermost planet can\ncompletely halt type I migrations of many outer planets through mutual resonant\nperturbations. Consequently, the convoy stays outside the disk edge, as a\nwhole. We have derived semi-analytical formula for the condition for the\neccentricity trap and predict how many planets are likely to be trapped. We\nfound that several planets or more should be trapped by this mechanism in\nprotoplanetary disks that have cavities.

The Fokker-Planck equation\nfor a particle in a periodic potential in the high-friction limit is solved\nusing the continued-fraction method.

In this protocol, the goal is to spread a piece of information\noriginating from one vertex throughout the network. Each vertex is assumed to\nhave a (cyclic) list of its neighbors. Once a vertex is informed by one of its\nneighbors, it chooses a position in its list uniformly at random and then\ninforms its neighbors starting from that position and proceeding in order of\nthe list. Angelopoulos, Doerr, Huber and Panagiotou [Electron.~J.~Combin.~2009]\nshowed that after $(1+o(1))(\\log_2 n + \\ln n)$ rounds, the rumor will have been\nbroadcasted to all nodes with probability $1 - o(1)$.\n  We study the broadcast time when the amount of randomness available at each\nnode is reduced in natural way.

Strong clustering is detected for all the subsamples of massive\ngalaxies characterized by different stellar masses (Mstar = 10^{11.0-11.5}\nMsun, 10^{11.5-12.0} Msun) or rest-frame colors (blue: U - V < 1.0, red: U - V\n> 1.0).

By means of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models\nfitted to the observed angular correlation function, we infer the properties of\nthe underlying host dark halos.

The observed evolution of bias factors indicates rapid evolution of\nspatial distributions of cold dark matter relative to those traced by the\nmassive galaxies, while the transition of host halo masses might imply that the\nfractional mass growth rate of halos is less than those of stellar systems.

This substantially weakens the coupling of the mesh size for the\nforce and the regularisation parameter, and greatly reduces the number of\ndegrees of freedom required.

We find that every sdB star cooler than $\\approx 27\\,500\\,$K\nthat Kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of the\nV1093~Her (PG~1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods.\nThe apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here.\n  The V1093~Her periods range from one to 4.5~h and are associated with\n$g-$mode pulsations. Three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of\n$p-$modes with periods of 2 to 5~m and in addition, these stars exhibit\nperiodicities between both classes from 15 to 45~m. We detect the coolest and\nlongest-period V1093~Her-type pulsator to date, KIC010670103 ($T_eff\\approx\n20\\,900\\,$K, $P_max\\approx 4.5$~h) as well as a suspected hybrid pulsator,\nKIC002697388 which is extremely cool ($T_{\\rm eff}\\approx 23\\,900\\,$K) and for\nthe first time hybrid pulsators which have larger $g-$mode amplitudes than\n$p-$mode ones. All of these pulsators are quite rich with many frequencies and\nwe are able to apply asymptotic relationships to associate periodicities with\nmodes for KIC010670103. Kepler data are particularly well-suited for these\nstudies as they are long-duration, extremely high duty cycle observations with\nwell-behaved noise properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 15:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

Constructive\nreasoning is supported natively by dependent type theory and classical\nreasoning is typically supported by adding additional non-constructive axioms.\nHowever, there is another perspective that views constructive logic as an\nextension of classical logic. This paper will illustrate how classical\nreasoning can be supported in a practical manner inside dependent type theory\nwithout additional axioms.
