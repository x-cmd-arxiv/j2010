As an Earth-like planet nears\ncrescent phases, the size of the ocean glint spot increases relative to the\nfraction of illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases.\nBoth effects change the planet's visible reflectivity as a function of phase.\nHowever, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce\nincreases in a planet's reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and\nsurface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric\nabsorption. Here we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an\natmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We\nuse the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3-D\nline-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's\nbroadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated\nsimulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We\nfind that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100% brighter at crescent phases\nthan simulations that do not include glint, and that the effect is dependent on\nboth orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused\nby Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first\nphase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant\nnuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the\nneutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this\nphase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a\nsteady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After\nneutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show\nthat in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final\nabundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the\nrare-earth peak.

Recently we rediscussed the problem of modelling the\ndouble-periodic pulsation with non-linear hydrocodes. We showed that the\npublished non-resonant double-mode models are incorrect, because they exclude\nthe negative buoyancy effects. Aims. We continue our efforts to verify whether\nthe Kuhfuss one-equation convection model with negative buoyancy included can\nreproduce the double-periodic Cepheid pulsation. Methods. Using the direct time\nintegration hydrocode, which implements the Kuhfuss convection model, we search\nfor stable double-periodic Cepheid models. We search for models pulsating in\nboth fundamental and first overtone modes (F+1O), as well as in the two lowest\norder overtones (1O+2O). In the latter case, we focus on reproducing\ndouble-overtone Cepheids of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results. We have\nfound full amplitude non-linear beat Cepheid models of both types, F+1O and\n1O+2O. In the case of F+1O models, the beat pulsation is most likely caused by\nthe three-mode resonance, 2omega_1=omega_0+omega_2, while in the\ndouble-overtone models the underlying mechanism (resonant or non-resonant)\ncannot be identified beyond doubt. Double-periodic models found in our survey\nexist, however, only in narrow period ranges and cannot explain the majority of\nthe observed double-periodic objects. Conclusions. With only little doubt left,\nwe conclude that current one dimensional one-equation convection models are\nincapable of reproducing the majority of the observed beat Cepheids. Among the\nshortcomings of current pulsation hydrocodes, the simple treatment of\nconvection seems to be the most severe one. Growing evidence for the presence\nof non-radial modes in Cepheids suggests that the interaction between radial\nand non-radial modes should also be investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

The\n21-cm radiation background from high redshift is analyzed through the\ncalculation of the 2-dimensional (2D) genus. The radiative transfer of\nhydrogen-ionizing photons and ionization-rate equations are calculated in a\nsuite of numerical simulations under various input parameters. The 2D genus is\ncalculated from the mock 21-cm images of the high-redshift Universe. We\nconstruct the 2D genus curve by varying the threshold differential brightness\ntemperature, and compare this to the 2D genus curve of the underlying density\nfield. We find that (1) the 2D genus curve reflects the evolutionary track of\ncosmic reionization and (2) the 2D genus curve can discriminate between certain\nreionization scenarios and thus indirectly probe the properties of\nradiation-sources. Choosing the right beam shape of a radio antenna is crucial\nfor this analysis.

By searching for\ntiming signals at the frequencies of the QPOs discovered in the 2004 December\n27 giant flare from the source, we find three QPOs at 84, 103, and 648 Hz in\nthree different bursts. The first two QPOs lie within 8.85% and 11.83%,\nrespectively, from the 92 Hz QPO detected in the giant flare. The third QPO lie\nwithin 3.75% from the 625 Hz QPO also detected in the same flare. The detected\nQPOs are found in bursts with different durations, morphologies, and\nbrightness, and are vindicated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also find\nevidence for candidate QPOs at higher frequencies in other bursts with lower\nstatistical significance. The fact that we can find evidence for QPOs in the\nrecurrent bursts at frequencies relatively close to those found in the giant\nflare is intriguing and can offer insight about the origin of the oscillations.\nWe confront our findings against the available theoretical models and discuss\nthe physical interpretation of these QPOs. The leading interpretation for the\norigin of magnetar QPOs suggests that these toroidal seismic oscillatory modes\nare most likely to be excited by a crustquake of the neutron star crust. Other\nmodels have been proposed to explain the magnetar QPO phenomena including\nmagnetospheric oscillations, magnetic flux tubes and modes of a passive debris\ndisk. Theoretical modeling and observation of QPOs will be very useful in\nputting stringent constraints on neutron star equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 21:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-25"}

In this study, we tackle this\nchallenge for smart grid with integrated wind generation, by leveraging\nmulti-timescale dispatch and scheduling. Specifically, we consider smart grids\nwith two classes of energy users - traditional energy users and opportunistic\nenergy users (e.g., smart meters or smart appliances), and investigate pricing\nand dispatch at two timescales, via day-ahead scheduling and realtime\nscheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, with the statistical information on wind\ngeneration and energy demands, we characterize the optimal procurement of the\nenergy supply and the day-ahead retail price for the traditional energy users;\nin realtime scheduling, with the realization of wind generation and the load of\ntraditional energy users, we optimize real-time prices to manage the\nopportunistic energy users so as to achieve systemwide reliability. More\nspecifically, when the opportunistic users are non-persistent, i.e., a subset\nof them leave the power market when the real-time price is not acceptable, we\nobtain closedform solutions to the two-level scheduling problem. For the\npersistent case, we treat the scheduling problem as a multitimescale Markov\ndecision process. We show that it can be recast, explicitly, as a classic\nMarkov decision process with continuous state and action spaces, the solution\nto which can be found via standard techniques. We conclude that the proposed\nmulti-scale dispatch and scheduling with real-time pricing can effectively\naddress the volatility and uncertainty of wind generation and energy demand,\nand has the potential to improve the penetration of renewable energy into smart\ngrids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 22:35:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 18:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Secondly, the onset of a secular bar-mode instability, associated\nwith the long lived plateau observed in the X-ray afterglows of many gamma-ray\nbursts (Corsi & Meszaros 2009a). With regards to detectability, we find that\nthe onset of a secular instability is the most optimistic scenario: under the\nhypothesis that SL-GRBs associated with secularly unstable magnetars occur at a\nrate of (48; 80)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} or greater, cross-correlation of data from two\nEinstein Telescopes (ETs) could detect the GW background associated to this\nsignal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater after 1 year of\nobservation.

By using the\nadaptive mesh refinement technique, the collapse is followed over a wide\ndynamic range from the scale of a turbulent cloud core to that of the first\ncore. The cloud core is lumpy in the low density region owing to the\nturbulence, while it has a smooth density distribution in the dense region\nproduced by the collapse. The shape of the dense region depends mainly on the\nmass of the cloud core; a massive cloud core tends to be prolate while a less\nmassive cloud core tends to be oblate. In both cases, anisotropy of the dense\nregion increases during the isothermal collapse. The minor axis of the dense\nregion is always oriented parallel to the local magnetic field.

Studies at 15.1 GHz were performed for the first time. Observations were\nconducted with the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg in Oct-Nov 2007 at the\nfrequencies of 8.5 and 15.1 GHz as part of an extensive campaign of\nmulti-station multi-frequency observations of the Crab pulsar. A selection of\nthe strongest pulses was recorded with a new data acquisition system, based on\na fast digital oscilloscope, providing nanosecond time resolution in two\npolarizations in a bandwidth of about 500 MHz. We analyzed the pulse shapes,\npolarisation and dynamic spectra of GPs as well as the cross-correlations\nbetween their LHC and RHC signals. No events were detected outside main pulse\nand interpulse windows. GP properties were found to be very different for GPs\nemitted at longitudes of the main pulse and the interpulse. Cross-correlations\nof the LHC and RHC signals show regular patterns in the frequency domain for\nthe main pulse, but these are missing for the interpulse GPs. We consider\nconsequences of application of the rotating vector model to explain the\napparent smooth variation in the position angle of linear polarization for main\npulse GPs.\n  We also introduce a new scenario of GP generation as a direct consequence of\nthe polar cap discharge. We find further evidence for strong nano-shot\ndischarges in the magnetosphere of the Crab pulsar. The repetitive frequency\nspectrum seen in GPs at the main pulse phase is interpreted as a diffraction\npattern of regular structures in the emission region. The interpulse GPs\nhowever have a spectrum that resembles that of amplitude modulated noise.\nPropagation effects may be the cause of the differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 09:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-20"}

In this paper, thus, we present NESVM, a fast gradient SVM solver\nthat can optimize various SVM models, e.g., classical SVM, linear programming\nSVM and least square SVM. Compared against SVM-Perf\n\\cite{SVM_Perf}\\cite{PerfML} (its convergence rate in solving the dual SVM is\nupper bounded by $\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{k})$, wherein $k$ is the number of\niterations.) and Pegasos \\cite{Pegasos} (online SVM that converges at rate\n$\\mathcal O(1/k)$ for the primal SVM), NESVM achieves the optimal convergence\nrate at $\\mathcal O(1/k^{2})$ and a linear time complexity. In particular,\nNESVM smoothes the non-differentiable hinge loss and $\\ell_1$-norm in the\nprimal SVM. Then the optimal gradient method without any line search is adopted\nto solve the optimization. In each iteration round, the current gradient and\nhistorical gradients are combined to determine the descent direction, while the\nLipschitz constant determines the step size. Only two matrix-vector\nmultiplications are required in each iteration round. Therefore, NESVM is more\nefficient than existing SVM solvers. In addition, NESVM is available for both\nlinear and nonlinear kernels. We also propose \"homotopy NESVM\" to accelerate\nNESVM by dynamically decreasing the smooth parameter and using the continuation\nmethod. Our experiments on census income categorization, indoor/outdoor scene\nclassification, event recognition and scene recognition suggest the efficiency\nand the effectiveness of NESVM.

For about two decades, knowledge based potentials based on\npairwise distances -- so-called \"potentials of mean force\" (PMFs) -- have been\ncenter stage in the prediction and design of protein structure and the\nsimulation of protein folding. However, the validity, scope and limitations of\nthese potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed, and the optimal\nchoice of the reference state -- a necessary component of these potentials --\nis an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible\nwork theorem in statistical physics, or by a statistical argument based on a\nlikelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many\nquestions unanswered. Here, we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as\napproximations to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic\njustification: they naturally arise when probability distributions over\ndifferent features of proteins need to be combined. We call these quantities\nreference ratio distributions deriving from the application of the reference\nratio method. This new view is not only of theoretical relevance, but leads to\nmany insights that are of direct practical use: the reference state is uniquely\ndefined and does not require external physical insights; the approach can be\ngeneralized beyond pairwise distances to arbitrary features of protein\nstructure; and it becomes clear for which purposes the use of these quantities\nis justified. We illustrate these insights with two applications, involving the\nradius of gyration and hydrogen bonding. In the latter case, we also show how\nthe reference ratio method can be iteratively applied to sculpt an energy\nfunnel. Our results considerably increase the understanding and scope of energy\nfunctions derived from known biomolecular structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 10:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 10:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 09:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

The emitter-SWNT coupling strongly depends on the position of\nthe emitter relative to the SWNT, the length of the SWNT, the dipole transition\nfrequency and the orientation of the emitter. In the high-frequency regime,\ndips in the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate exist at the resonance\nfrequencies in the spectrum of the SWNT conductivity. In the\nintermediate-frequency regime, the SWNT conductivity is very low, and the\nspontaneous decay rate is practically unaffected by the SWNT. In the\nlow-frequency regime, the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate contains\nresonances at the antennas resonance frequencies for surface-wave propagation\nin the SWNT. Enhancement of both the total and radiative spontaneous decay\nrates by several orders in magnitude is predicted at these resonance\nfrequencies. The strong emitter-field coupling is achieved, in spite of the low\nQ factor of the antenna resonances, due to the very high magnitude of the\nelectromagnetic field in the near-field zone.

We do find that none of the jet survives beyond\nthis scale, but we find that almost all of our jet stops at a parametrically\nsmaller scale proportional to (E L)^{1/4}, where L is the size of the\nspace-time region where the jet is initially created.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 12:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 13:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

These correlations are revealed by the study\nof bifurcation plots, which show that the model responses to changes in\ninhibition belong to two families. After investigating and characterizing\nthese, we discuss their essential differences in terms of four important\naspects: power responses with respect to the modeled action of anesthetics,\nreaction to exogenous stimuli, distribution of model parameters and oscillatory\nrepertoires when inhibition is enhanced. Furthermore, while the complexity of\nsustained periodic orbits differs significantly between families, we are able\nto show how metamorphoses between the families can be brought about by\nexogenous stimuli. We unveil links between measurable physiological attributes\nof the brain and dynamical patterns that are not accessible by linear methods.\nThey emerge when the parameter space is partitioned according to bifurcation\nresponses. This partitioning cannot be achieved by the investigation of only a\nsmall number of parameter sets, but is the result of an automated bifurcation\nanalysis of a representative sample of 73,454 physiologically admissible sets.\nOur approach generalizes straightforwardly and is well suited to probing the\ndynamics of other models with large and complex parameter spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 13:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In the case of the Tri-bimaximal pattern with two degenerate\nmasses we give a specific realization of the underlying $U(1)$ symmetry which\ncan be uplifted to a symmetry in a complete theory including charged leptons.\nFor this, we present a model with three light SM-like\n  Higgs doublets and one heavy Higgs triplet and find that one can accommodate\nthe hierarchy of the charged lepton masses. The lepton mass spectrum can also\nbe achieved in another model extending the SM with three SM-singlet scalars\ntransforming non trivially under the flavor symmetry. We discuss how such a\nmodel has room for generating enough baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis in\nthe framework of Type-I and II seesaw mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

Considerable effort has been made in identifying\nproperties which ensure tractability in such problems. In this work, we\ninitiate the study of hybrid tractability of soft constraint problems; that is,\nproperties which guarantee tractability of the given soft constraint problem,\nbut which do not depend only on the underlying structure of the instance (such\nas being tree-structured) or only on the types of soft constraints in the\ninstance (such as submodularity). We present several novel hybrid classes of\nsoft constraint problems, which include a machine scheduling problem,\nconstraint problems of arbitrary arities with no overlapping nogoods, and the\nSoftAllDiff constraint with arbitrary unary soft constraints.
