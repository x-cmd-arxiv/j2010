However, these predictions were made even before the first\nobservations of gravitational lensing, whereas nowadays gravitational\nmicrolensing surveys towards the Galactic bulge yield almost 1000 events per\nyear where one star magnifies the light of a more distant one. With a specific\nview on those experiments, we therefore carry out simulations to assess the\nprospects for detection of the transient periodic magnification of the\ncompanion star, which lasts typically only a few hours binaries involving a\nmain-sequence star. We find that detectability is given by the achievability of\ndense monitoring with the required photometric accuracy. In sharp contrast to\nearlier expectations by other authors, we find that main-sequence stars are not\nsubstantially less favourable targets to observe this effect than white dwarfs.\nThe requirement of an almost edge-on orbit leads to a probability of the order\nof $3 \\times 10^{-4}$ for spotting the signature of an existing compact object\nin a binary system with this technique. Assuming an abundance of such systems\nabout 0.4 per cent, a high-cadence monitoring every 15~min with 5 per cent\nphotometric accuracy would deliver a signal rate per target star of $\\gamma\n\\sim 4 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ at a recurrence period of about 6 months.\nWith microlensing surveys having demonstrated the capability to monitor about\n$2 \\times 10^{8}$ stars, one is therefore provided with the chance to detect\nroughly semi-annually recurring self-lensing signals from several compact\ncompacts in a binary system. If the photometric accuracy was pushed down to 0.3\nper cent, 10 times as many signals would become detectable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 18:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

L673-7 is seen in absorption against\nthe mid-infrared background in 5.8, 8, and 24 micron Spitzer images, allowing\nfor a derivation of the column density profile and total enclosed mass of\nL673-7, independent of dust temperature assumptions. Estimates of the core mass\nfrom these absorption profiles range from 0.2-4.5 solar masses. Millimeter\ncontinuum emission indicates a mass of about 2 solar masses, both from a direct\ncalculation assuming isothermal dust and from dust radiative transfer models\nconstrained by the millimeter observations. We use dust radiative transfer\nmodels to constrain the internal luminosity of L673-7, defined to be the\nluminosity of the central source and excluding the luminosity from external\nheating, to be 0.01-0.045 solar luminosities, with 0.04 solar luminosities the\nmost likely value. L673-7 is thus classified as a very low luminosity object\n(VeLLO), and is among the lowest luminosity VeLLOs yet studied. We calculate\nthe kinematic and dynamic properties of the molecular outflow in the standard\nmanner, and we show that the expected accretion luminosity based on these\noutflow properties is greater than or equal to 0.36 solar luminosities. The\ndiscrepancy between this expected accretion luminosity and the internal\nluminosity derived from dust radiative transfer models indicates that the\ncurrent accretion rate is much lower than the average rate over the lifetime of\nthe outflow. Although the protostar embedded within L673-7 is consistent with\ncurrently being substellar, it is unlikely to remain as such given the\nsubstantial mass reservoir remaining in the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 19:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Using this survey data alone, we\nhave measured the luminosity function of the Kuiper belt, thus avoiding any\nbiases that might come from the inclusion of other observations. We have found\nthat the Cold population defined as having inclinations less than 5 degrees has\na luminosity function slope alpha=0.82+-0.23, and is different from the Hot\npopulation, which has inclinations greater than 5 degrees and a luminosity\nfunction slope alpha=0.35+-0.21.

This result, along with similar findings of past surveys\ndemonstrates that the dynamically cold Kuiper belt objects likely have a steep\nsize distribution, and are unique from all of the excited populations which\nhave much shallower distributions. This suggests that the dynamically excited\npopulation underwent a different accretion history and achieved a more evolved\nstate of accretion than the cold population.

We address the feasibility of a gravitational\nheating mechanism, utilizing the gravitational energy released by the gas that\nstreams into the potential well of the cluster dark-matter halo. We focus here\non a specific form of gravitational heating in which the energy is transferred\nto the medium thorough the drag exerted on inflowing gas clumps. Using\nspheri-symmetric hydro simulations with a subgrid representation of these\nclumps, we confirm our earlier estimates that in haloes >=10^13 solar masses\nthe gravitational heating is more efficient than the cooling everywhere. The\nworry was that this could overheat the core and generate an instability that\nmight push it away from equilibrium. However, we find that the overheating does\nnot change the global halo properties, and that convection can stabilize the\ncluster by carrying energy away from the overheated core. In a typical rich\ncluster of 10^{14-15}solar masses, with ~5% of the accreted baryons in gas\nclumps of ~10^8 solar masses, we derive upper and lower limits for the\ntemperature and entropy profiles and show that they are consistent with those\nobserved in cool-core clusters.

It has\nrecently been argued that when identical copies of a quantum measurement system\nexist, the standard projection operators and Born rule method for calculating\nprobabilities must be supplemented by estimates of relative frequencies of\nobservers. We argue that an infinite space actually renders the Born rule\nredundant, by physically realizing all outcomes of a quantum measurement in\ndifferent regions, with relative frequencies given by the square of the wave\nfunction amplitudes. Our formal argument hinges on properties of what we term\nthe quantum confusion operator, which projects onto the Hilbert subspace where\nthe Born rule fails, and we comment on its relation to the oft-discussed\nquantum frequency operator. This analysis unifies the classical and quantum\nlevels of parallel universes that have been discussed in the literature, and\nhas implications for several issues in quantum measurement theory. It also\nshows how, even for a single measurement, probabilities may be interpreted as\nrelative frequencies in unitary (Everettian) quantum mechanics. We also argue\nthat after discarding a zero-norm part of the wavefunction, the remainder\nconsists of a superposition of indistinguishable terms, so that arguably\n\"collapse\" of the wavefunction is irrelevant, and the \"many worlds\" of\nEverett's interpretation are unified into one.

First, using\nsimplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different\nalgorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a\nfactor of ~5 for massive haloes (>10^{12}Msun). The algorithms are in better\nagreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore,\ntheir cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. However,\nfor less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less cooling than corresponding\n1D hydrodynamic models. Second, we study the gas accretion history of the\ncentral galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of\nmergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies\nwithin small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion\nin the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high mass\nhaloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion\nrate is about two times larger. Comparing to cosmological SPH simulations, we\nfind that most SAMs systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates for\nlow-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive haloes.\nAlthough the models all include both \"rapid\" and \"slow\" mode accretion, the\ntransition between the two accretion modes varies between models and also\ndiffers from the simulations.

Rotationally excited lines of\nCO are a very robust diagnostic in the study of circumstellar envelopes (CSEs).\nWhen sampling different layers of the CSE, observations of these molecular\nlines lead to detailed profiles of kinetic temperature, expansion velocity, and\ndensity. A state-of-the-art, nonlocal thermal equilibrium, and co-moving frame\nradiative transfer code that predicts CO line intensities in the CSEs of\nlate-type stars is used in deriving relations between stellar and\nmolecular-line parameters, on the one hand, and mass-loss rate, on the other.\nWe present analytical expressions for estimating the mass-loss rates of evolved\nstellar objects for 8 rotational transitions of the CO molecule, apply them to\nour extensive CO data set covering 47 stars, and compare our results to those\nof previous studies. Our expressions account for line saturation and resolving\nof the envelope, thereby allowing accurate determination of very high mass-loss\nrates. We argue that, for estimates based on a single rotational line, the\nCO(2-1) transition provides the most reliable mass-loss rate. The mass-loss\nrates calculated for the AGB stars range from 4x10^-8 Msun/yr up to 8x10^-5\nMsun/yr. For RSGs they reach values between 2x10^-7 Msun/yr and 3x10^-4\nMsun/yr. The estimates for the set of CO transitions allow time variability to\nbe identified in the mass-loss rate. Possible mass-loss-rate variability is\ntraced for 7 of the sample stars. We find a clear relation between the\npulsation periods of the AGB stars and their derived mass-loss rates, with a\nlevelling off at approx. 3x10^-5 Msun/yr for periods exceeding 850 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 20:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this paper we use regions of high Ly-alpha transmission (near-zones)\naround the highest redshift quasars to measure the quasar EUV spectral index at\nz~6. We jointly fit the available observations for variation of near-zone size\nwith both redshift and luminosity, and propose that the observed relation\nprovides evidence for an EUV spectral index that varies with absolute magnitude\nin the high redshift quasar sample, becoming softer at higher luminosity. Using\na large suite of detailed numerical simulations we find that the typical value\nof spectral index for a luminous quasar at z~6 is constrained to be\nalpha=1.3+/-0.4 for a specific luminosity of the form L\\propto\\nu^{-alpha}.

We show that the morphologies observed at 3.6 and 4.5 um are\nsimilar to each other, and to H2 1-0 S(1). This is well explained by thermal H2\nemission at non-LTE if the dissociation rate is significantly larger than\n0.002-0.02, allowing thermal collisions to be dominated by atomic hydrogen. In\ncontrast, the 5.8 and 8.0 um emission shows different morphologies from the\nothers in some regions. This emission appears to be more enhanced at the wakes\nin bow shocks, or less enhanced in patchy structures in the jet. These\ntendencies are explained by the fact that thermal H2 emission in the 5.8 and\n8.0 um band is enhanced in regions at lower densities and temperatures.\nThroughout, the observed similarities and differences in morphology between\nfour bands and 1-0 S(1) are well explained by thermal H2 emission. The observed\nSEDs are categorized into:- (A) those in which the flux monotonically increases\nwith wavelength; and (B) those with excess emission at 4.5-um. The type-A SEDs\nare explained by thermal H2 emission, in particular with simple shock models\nwith a power-law cooling function.

In this condition, a system is still stable, but is\nhowever subject to a swarming of arbitrary 3D small perturbations. These can\narrive any instant, and then undergo a transient evolution which is ruled out\nby the initial-value problem associated to the Navier-Stokes linearized\nformulation. The set of 3D small perturbations constitutes a system of multiple\nspatial and temporal scales which are subject to all the processes included in\nthe perturbative Navier-Stokes equations: linearized convective transport,\nlinearized vortical stretching and tilting, and the molecular diffusion.\nLeaving aside nonlinear interaction among the different scales, these features\nare tantamount to the features of the turbulent state.

A consequence\nof the conjecture is that the energy density and the longitudinal-stress\noperators measure the distribution of the transverse position of the string, to\nleading order in the string fluctuations, whereas the transverse-stress\noperator does not. We interpret recent numerical measurements of the transverse\nsize of the confining string and show that the difference of the energy and\nlongitudinal-stress operators is the appropriate probe to use when comparing\nwith the next-to-leading order string prediction.

An fBm cloud with a realistic projected\npower spectrum slope of $\\beta=2.8$ is found to have a mass function for clumps\nexceeding a threshold density that is a power-law with a slope of\n$\\alpha=2.35$, the same as in the Salpeter IMF. Any hierarchically structured\ncloud has a clump mass function with about the same slope. This result implies\nthat turbulent interstellar clouds produce dense substructure with the observed\npre-stellar core mass function built in from the start. Details of the clump\nformation processes are not critical. The conversion of clumps into stars\ninvolves a second step. A one-to-one correspondence between clump mass and star\nmass is not necessary to convert the clump mass spectrum into an IMF with the\nsame power-law slope. As long as clumps have an internal stellar IMF from\nsub-fragmentation, protostellar accretion, coalescence and other processes, and\nthe characteristic mass for this internal IMF scales with the clump mass, then\nthe IMF slope above the minimum characteristic mass will equal the clump mass\nslope. A detailed review of IMF models illustrates the prominence of cloud\nstructure as a major component in a wide class of theories. Tests are proposed\nto determine the relative importance of cloud structure and competitive\naccretion in the IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 15:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
