To do so, we provide\nrelationships among colours involving Gaia magnitudes and colours from other\ncommonly used photometric systems (Johnson-Cousins, SDSS, Hipparcos and Tycho).\nThe most up-to-date information from industrial partners has been used to\ndefine the nominal passbands and based on the BaSeL3.1 stellar spectral energy\ndistribution library, relationships were obtained for stars with different\nreddening values, ranges of temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities.\nThe transformations involving Gaia and Johnson-Cousins V-I_C and Sloan DSS g-z\ncolours have the lowest residuals. A polynomial expression for the relation\nbetween the effective temperature and the colour G_BP-G_RP was derived for\nstars with T > 4500 K. Transformations involving two Johnson or two Sloan DSS\ncolours yield lower residuals than using only one colour. We also computed\nseveral ratios of total-to-selective absorption including absorption A_G in the\nG band and colour excess E(G_BP-G_RP) for our sample stars. A relationship,\ninvolving A_G/A_V and the intrinsic (V-I_C) colour, is provided. The derived\nGaia passbands have been used to compute tracks and isochrones using the Padova\nand BASTI models. Finally, the performances of the predicted Gaia magnitudes\nhave been estimated according to the magnitude and the celestial coordinates of\nthe star. The provided dependencies among colours can be used for planning\nscientific exploitation of Gaia data, performing simulations of the Gaia-like\nsky, planning ground-based complementary observations and for building\ncatalogues with auxiliary data for the Gaia data processing and validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 16:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 10:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Submodular functions come up in a variety of applications in\ncombinatorial optimization. For a vast range of algorithms, the existence of an\noracle to a submodular function is assumed. But how does one check if this\noracle indeed represents a submodular function?\n  Consider a function f:{0,1}^n \\rightarrow R. The distance to submodularity is\nthe minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to be modified to make f\nsubmodular. If this distance is more than epsilon > 0, then we say that f is\nepsilon-far from being submodular. The aim is to have an efficient procedure\nthat, given input f that is epsilon-far from being submodular, certifies that f\nis not submodular. We analyze a very natural tester for this problem, and prove\nthat it runs in subexponential time. This gives the first non-trivial tester\nfor submodularity. On the other hand, we prove an interesting lower bound (that\nis, unfortunately, quite far from the upper bound) suggesting that this tester\ncannot be very efficient in terms of epsilon. This involves non-trivial\nexamples of functions which are far from submodular and yet do not exhibit too\nmany local violations.\n  We also provide some constructions indicating the difficulty in designing a\ntester for submodularity. We construct a partial function defined on\nexponentially many points that cannot be extended to a submodular function, but\nany strict subset of these values can be extended to a submodular function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 17:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-05"}

In\nthis paper a novel numerical approach is proposed for the computation of the\nBasset history force based on the use of exponential functions to approximate\nthe tail of the Basset force kernel.

Traditional methods for the calculation of the Basset history\nforce can influence statistical properties of the particles in isotropic\nturbulence, which is due to the error made by approximating the Basset force\nand the limited number of particles that can be tracked with classical methods.\nThe new method turns out to provide more reliable statistical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 17:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

While overdensities of star-forming galaxies have been found\naround QSOs at 2<z<5, the case for excess galaxy clustering around QSOs at z>6\nis less clear. Previous studies with HST have reported the detection of small\nexcesses of faint dropout galaxies in some QSO fields, but these surveys probed\na relatively small region surrounding the QSOs. To overcome this problem, we\nhave observed the most distant QSO at z=6.4 using the large field of view of\nthe Suprime-Cam (34' x 27'). Newly-installed CCDs allowed us to select Lyman\nbreak galaxies (LBG) at z~6.4 more efficiently. We found seven LBGs in the QSO\nfield, whereas only one exists in a comparison field. The significance of this\napparent excess is difficult to quantify without spectroscopic confirmation and\nadditional control fields. The Poisson probability to find seven objects when\none expects four is ~10%, while the probability to find seven objects in one\nfield and only one in the other is less than 0.4%, suggesting that the QSO\nfield is significantly overdense relative to the control field. We find some\nevidence that the LBGs are distributed in a ring-like shape centered on the QSO\nwith a radius of ~3 Mpc. There are no candidate LBGs within 2 Mpc from the QSO,\ni.e., galaxies are clustered around the QSO but appear to avoid the very\ncenter. These results suggest that the QSO is embedded in an overdense region\nwhen defined on a sufficiently large scale. This suggests that the QSO was\nindeed born in a massive halo. The central deficit of galaxies may indicate\nthat (1) the strong UV radiation from the QSO suppressed galaxy formation in\nits vicinity, or (2) that star-formation closest to the QSO occurs mostly in an\nobscured mode that is missed by our UV selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Combined with a better spatial resolution, AKARI can much\nmore precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (L_TIR) of individual\ngalaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the local\nUniverse.

Theoretical\nmodels of planet formation suggest that this peak in the mid-infrared emission\ncould be due to the formation of Pluto-sized bodies in the disc, which ignite\nthe collisional cascade and enhance the production of small dust. Here we\npresent resolved mid-infrared imaging of the disc of HD191089 (F5V in the BPMG)\nand consider its implications for the state of planet formation in this system.\nHD191089 was observed at 18.3 microns using T-ReCS on Gemini South and the\nimages were compared to models of the disc to constrain the radial distribution\nof the dust. The emission observed at 18.3 microns is shown to be significantly\nextended beyond the PSF at a position angle of 80 degrees. This is the first\ntime dust emission has been resolved around HD191089.

This provides\na ready tool for classifying the nature of star-disc systems based on infrared\nphotometry. In particular we demonstrate the distinct loci followed by discs\nthat undergo `uniform draining' (reduction in surface density by a spatially\nuniform factor) from those that clear from the inside out. We draw attention to\nthe absence of objects on this `draining locus' in those star forming regions\nwhere the 24um sensitivity would permit their detection, as compared with the\n~20 objects in these regions with colours suggestive of inner holes. We thus\nconclude that discs predominantly clear from the inside out. We also apply our\nclassification of the infrared two colour plane to stars of spectral type M3-M5\nin the IC 348 cluster and show that some of its members (dubbed `weak excess'\nsources by Muzerolle et al 2010) that had previously been assumed to be in a\nstate of clearing are instead likely to be optically thick discs in which the\ndust is well settled towards the mid-plane. Nevertheless, there are many discs\nin a state of partial clearing in IC 348, with their abundance (relative to the\ntotal population of disc bearing stars) being around four times higher than for\ncomparable stars in Taurus. However, the number of partially cleared discs\nrelative to the total number of late type stars is similarly low in both\nregions (10 and 20 % respectively). We therefore conclude that IC 348\nrepresents a more evolved version of the Taurus population (with more of its\ndiscs being highly settled or partially cleared) but that the timescale for\nclearing is similarly short (a few times 10^5 years) in both cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2010 20:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Here we report that the theory can naturally explain the\nemergence of non-superconducting checkerboard phases and the magic doping\nproblem in hole-doped cuprate superconductors.

In the collapsing cloud, the\nfirst adiabatic core appears prior to the protostar formation. Reflecting the\nthermodynamics of the collapsing gas, the first core is much more massive than\nthe protostar. When the molecular cloud has no angular momentum, the first core\nfalls onto the protostar and disappears a few years after the protostar\nformation. On the other hand, when the molecular cloud has an angular momentum,\nthe first core does not disappear even after the protostar formation, and\ndirectly evolves into the circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. There\nare two paths for the formation of the circumstellar disk. When the initial\ncloud has a considerably small rotational energy, two nested disks appear just\nafter the protostar formation. During the early main accretion phase, the inner\ndisk increases its size and merges with the outer disk (i.e. first core) to\nform a single circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. On the other hand,\nwhen the molecular cloud has a rotational energy comparable to observations, a\nsingle Keplerian disk that corresponds to the first core already exists prior\nto the protostar formation. In such a cloud, the first core density gradually\nincreases, maintaining the Keplerian rotation and forms the protostar inside\nit. Thus, the protostar is born in the Keplerian disk. In other words, a\nmassive disk already exists before the protostar formation. In each case, the\nprotostar at its formation is already surrounded by a massive circumstellar\ndisk. The circumstellar disk is about 10-100 times more massive than the\nprotostar in the main accretion disk. Such disks are favourable sites for the\nformation of binary companions and gas-giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 07:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The filaments show outward\npropagating striations with inclination angles suggesting that they are aligned\nwith the local magnetic field. We interpret it as the equivalent of the\nstriations seen in the walls of small isolated magnetic structures. Their\norigin is then a corrugation of the boundary between an overturning convective\nflow inside the filament and the magnetic field wrapping around it. The outward\npropagation is a combination of a pattern motion due to the downflow observed\nalong the sides of bright filaments, and the Evershed flow. The observed short\nwavelength of the striation argues against the existence of a dynamically\nsignificant horizontal field inside the bright filaments. Its intensity\ncontrast is explained by the same physical effect that causes the dark cores of\nfilaments, light bridges and `canals'.

Observed donors are\noversized in comparison with those of isolated single stars of the same mass,\nwhich is thought to be a consequence of the mass loss. Using the empirical\nmass-radius relation of CVs and the homologous approximation for changes in\neffective temperature T_2, orbital period P, and luminosity of the donor with\nthe stellar radius, we find the semi-empirical mass-loss rate M2_dot of CVs as\na function of P. The derived M2_dot is at ~10^(-9.5)-10^(-10) Msun/yr and\ndepends weakly on P when P > 90 min, while it declines very rapidly towards the\nminimum period when P < 90 min, emulating the P-T_2 relation. Due to strong\ndeviation from thermal equilibrium caused by the mass loss, the semi-empirical\nM2_dot is significantly different from, and has a less-pronounced turnaround\nbehavior with P than suggested by previous numerical models. The semi-empirical\nP-M2_dot relation is consistent with the angular momentum loss due to\ngravitational wave emission, and strongly suggests that CV secondaries with\n0.075 Msun < M_2 < 0.2 Msun are less than 2 Gyrs old. When applied to selected\neclipsing CVs, our semi-empirical mass-loss rates are in good agreement with\nthe accretion rates derived from the effective temperatures T_1 of white\ndwarfs, suggesting that M2_dot can be used to reliably infer T_2 from T_1.\nBased on the semi-empirical M2_dot, SDSS 1501 and 1433 systems that were\npreviously identified as post-bounce CVs have yet to reach the minimal period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 11:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Here we present follow-up mm observations\nthat demonstrate a periodicity to the phenomenon. While monitoring 3 new\nperiastron encounters, we detect flares within 17.5 hrs (or 4.6%) of the\norbital phase of the first reported flare, and we constrain the main emitting\nregion to a stellar height of 3.7-6.8 Rstar. The recorded activity is\nconsistent with the proposed picture for synchrotron emission initiated by a\nmagnetic reconnection event when the two stellar magnetospheres of the highly\neccentric (e=0.556) binary are believed to collide near periastron as the stars\napproach a minimum separation of 8 Rstar (~13 Rsolar). The similar light curve\ndecay profiles allow us to estimate an average flare duration of 30 hrs.\nAssuming one mm flare per orbit, DQ Tau could spend approximately 8% of its\n15.8-d orbital period in an elevated flux state. Our analysis of the mm\nemission provides an upper limit of 5% on the linear polarization. We discuss\nthe extent to which a severely entangled magnetic field structure and Faraday\nrotation effects are likely to reduce the observed polarization fraction. We\nalso predict that, for the current picture, the stellar magnetospheres must be\nmisaligned at a significant angle or, alternatively, that the topologies of the\nouter magnetospheres are poorly described by a well-ordered dipole inside a\nradius of 7 Rstar. Finally, to investigate whether reorganization of the\nmagnetic field during the interaction affects mass accretion, we also present\nsimultaneous optical (VRI) monitoring, as an established tracer of accretion\nactivity in this system. We find that an accretion event can occur coincident\nin both time and duration with the synchrotron fallout of a magnetic\nreconnection event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 14:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The LFK\nalgorithm constructs natural communities of (in principle) all nodes of a graph\nby maximising the local fitness of communities. The resulting modules can\noverlap. The generation of communities can easily be repeated for many values\nof resolution; thus allowing different views on the network at different\nresolutions. We implemented the main idea of the LFK algorithm---to generate\nnatural communities of each node of a network---in a different way. We start\nwith a value of the resolution parameter that is high enough for each node to\nbe its own natural community. As soon as the resolution is reduced, each node\nacquires other nodes as members of its community, i.e. natural communities\ngrow. For each community found at a certain resolution level we calculate the\nnext lower resolution where a node is added. After adding a node to a community\nof a seed node we check whether it is also the natural community of a node that\nwe have already analysed. In this case, we can stop expanding the seed node's\ncommunity. We tested our algorithm on a small benchmark graph and on a network\nof about 500 papers in information science (weighted with the Salton index of\nbibliographic coupling). In our tests, this approach results in characteristic\nranges of resolution where a large resolution change does not lead to a growth\nof the natural community. Such stable modules were also obtained by applying\nthe LFK algorithm but since we determine communities for all resolution values\nin one run, our approach is faster than the LFK reference. And our algorithm\nreveals the hierarchical structure of the graph more easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 15:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}

Although the mechanism can be implemented in either a chain of\nquantum dots or donors, a 1D chain of donors in Si is of particular interest\ndue to the natural confining potential of donors that can in principle help\nreduce the gate densities in solid-state quantum computing architectures. Using\ndetailed atomistic modeling, we investigate CTAP in a more realistic triple\ndonor system in the presence of inevitable fabrication imperfections. In\nparticular, we investigate how an adiabatic pathway for CTAP is affected by\ndonor misplacements, and propose schemes to correct for such errors. We also\ninvestigate the sensitivity of the adiabatic path to gate voltage fluctuations.\nThe tight-binding based atomistic treatment of straggle used here may benefit\nunderstanding of other donor nanostructures, such as donor-based charge and\nspin qubits. Finally, we derive an effective 3 \\times 3 model of CTAP that\naccurately resembles the voltage tuned lowest energy states of the\nmulti-million atom tight-binding simulations, and provides a translation\nbetween intensive atomistic Hamiltonians and simplified effective Hamiltonians\nwhile retaining the relevant atomic-scale information. This method can help\ncharacterize multi-donor experimental structures quickly and accurately even in\nthe presence of imperfections, overcoming some of the numeric intractabilities\nof finding optimal eigenstates for non-ideal donor placements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 04:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-10"}

We give explicit formulas for these optimally space\nlocalized polynomials and determine in the case of the Jacobi polynomials the\nrelation of the generalized mean value to the position variance of a well-known\nuncertainty principle.
