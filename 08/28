We acquired very-high-precision,\nnarrow-band photometry in four bandpasses around the K I absorption feature\nduring the January 2010 transit of HD 80606b and during out-of-transit\nobservations conducted in January and April of 2010. We obtained differential\nphotometric precisions of \\sim 2.08e-4 for the in-transit flux ratio measured\nat 769.91-nm, which probes the K I line core. We find no significant difference\nin the in-transit flux ratio between observations at 768.76 and 769.91 nm. Yet,\nwe find a difference of \\sim 8.09 \\pm 2.88e-4 between these observations and\nobservations at a longer wavelength that probes the K I wing (777.36 nm). While\nthe presence of red noise in the transit data has a non-negligible effect on\nthe uncertainties in the flux ratio, the 777.36-769.91 nm colour during transit\nshows no effects from red noise and also indicates a significant colour change,\nwith a mean value of \\sim 8.99\\pm0.62e-4. This large change in the colour is\nequivalent to a \\sim 4.2% change in the apparent planetary radius with\nwavelength, which is much larger than the atmospheric scale height. This\nimplies the observations probed the atmosphere at very low pressures as well as\na dramatic change in the pressure at which the slant optical depth reaches\nunity between \\sim770 and 777 nm. We hypothesize that the excess absorption may\nbe due to K I in a high-speed wind being driven from the exoplanet's exosphere.\nWe discuss the viability of this and alternative interpretations, including\nstellar limb darkening, starspots, and effects from Earth's atmosphere. We\nstrongly encourage follow-up observations of HD 80606b to confirm the signal\nmeasured here.

The competition between quantum self-purification and the free surface\nrelaxations is investigated. The free surfaces of crystals smaller than 2 nm\ndistort the Jahn-Teller relaxation and enhance the reconstruction bonds. This\nincreases the energy splitting of the quantum states and reduces the energy of\nformation to as low as 1 eV per defect in the smallest nanocrystals. In\ncrystals larger than 2 nm the observed symmetry of the Jahn-Teller distortion\nmatches the symmetry expected for bulk Ge crystals. Near the nanocrystal's\nsurface the vacancy is found to have an energy of formation no larger than 0.5\nto 1.4 eV per defect, but a vacancy more than 0.7 nm inside the surface has an\nenergy of formation that is the same as in bulk Ge. No evidence of the\nself-purification effect is observed; the dominant effect is the free surface\nrelaxations, which allow for the enhanced reconstruction.

In amorphous\nphotonic media, the domain sizes are too small to form PBGs, thus the depletion\nof the DOS is weakened significantly. The critical domain size that separates\nthe polycrystalline and amorphous regimes is determined by the attenuation\nlength of Bragg scattering, which depends not only on the degree of positional\norder but also the refractive index contrast of the photonic material.

The Irving--Kirkwood--Noll procedure is extended\nto multi-body potentials with continuously differentiable extensions and\ngeneralized to non-straight bonds, which may be important for particles with\ninternal structure. Connections between this approach and the direct spatial\naveraging approach of Murdoch and Hardy are discussed and the Murdoch--Hardy\nprocedure is systematized. Possible sources of non-uniqueness of the stress\ntensor, resulting separately from both procedures, are identified and\naddressed. Numerical experiments using molecular dynamics and lattice statics\nare conducted to examine the behavior of the resulting stress definitions\nincluding their convergence with the spatial averaging domain size and their\nsymmetry properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2010 23:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}

Reaching the depth 0.5 magnitude deeper than our\nprevious survey in the Subaru Deep Field that led to the discovery of a z=6.96\nLAE, we detected three probable z=7 LAE candidates. Even if all the candidates\nare real, the Lyman alpha luminosity function (LF) at z=7 shows a significant\ndeficit from the LF at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. The LAE number and\nLyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those at\nz=5.7 to the Lyman alpha line luminosity limit of L(Ly-alpha) >~ 9.2 x 10^{42}\nerg s^{-1}.

If the answer is positive, then the other wave-packets are\ncalled in literature empty waves. The wave-packet containing the object is\ncalled a full wave, and is the only one that would produce a recording in a\ndetector. A question immediately arising is whether the empty waves may also\nhave an observable effect. Different works were dedicated to the elucidation of\nthis question. None of them proved that the hypothesis of full/empty waves is\ncorrect - it may be that the Nature is indeed non-deterministic and the quantum\nobject is not confined to one region of the space-time. All the works that\nproved that the empty waves have an effect, in fact, proved that if there exist\nfull and empty waves, then the latter may have an observable effect. This is\nalso the purpose and the limitation of the present work. What is shown here is\nthat if the hypothesis is true, the empty waves have an influence. An\nexperiment is indicated which reveals this influence. The analysis of the\nexperiment is according to the quantum formalism. This experiment has the\nadvantage of being more intuitive and practically more feasible than a previous\nproposal also in agreement with the quantum formalism.

In\nthe continuum it is related to the standard SF by a non-singlet chiral field\nrotation and therefore referred to as the chirally rotated SF ($\\chi$SF). On\nthe lattice with Wilson fermions the relation is not exact, suggesting some\ninteresting tests of universality. The main advantage of the $\\chi$SF consists\nin its compatibility with the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement. In\nthis paper the basic set-up is introduced and discussed. Chirally rotated SF\nboundary conditions are implemented on the lattice using an orbifold\nconstruction. The lattice symmetries imply a list of counterterms, which\ndetermine how the action and the basic fermionic two-point functions are\nrenormalised and O($a$) improved. As with the standard SF, a logarithmically\ndivergent boundary counterterm leads to a multiplicative renormalisation of the\nfermionic boundary fields. In addition, a finite dimension 3 boundary\ncounterterm must be tuned in order to preserve the chirally rotated boundary\nconditions in the interacting theory. Once this is achieved, O($a$) effects\noriginating from the bulk action or from insertions of composite operators in\nthe bulk can be avoided by the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement. The\nremaining O($a$) effects arise from the boundaries and can be cancelled by\ntuning a couple of O($a$) boundary counterterms. The general results are\nillustrated in the free theory where the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert term is shown\nto affect correlation functions only at O($a^2$), irrespective of its\ncoefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2010 12:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 15:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-21"}

In this paper, selected for studying are 16 active-region coronal\narcades whose gradual inflation lead up to CMEs. 12 of them clearly build upon\npost-eruptive arcades resulting from a preceding eruption. The observed\ninflation sustains for 8.7 +/- 4.1 h, with the arcade rising from 1.15 +/- 0.06\nRsun to 1.36 +/- 0.07 Rsun within the EIT field of view (FOV). The rising speed\nis less than 5 km s-1 for most of the time. Only at the end of this\nquasi-static stage, it increases to tens of kilometers per second over tens of\nminutes. The arcade then erupts out of the EIT FOV as a CME with similar\nmorphology. This pre-CME structure is apparently unaffected by the flares\noccurring during its quasi-static inflation phase, but is closely coupled with\nthe flare occurring during its acceleration phase. For four events that were\nobserved on the disk, it is found that the gradual inflation of the arcade is\naccompanied by significant helicity injection from photosphere. In particular,\na swirling structure, which is reminiscent of a magnetic flux rope, was\nobserved in one of the arcades over 4 h prior to the subsequent CME, and the\ngrowth of the arcade is associated with the injection of helicity of opposite\nsense into the active region via flux emergence. We propose a four-phase\nevolution paradigm for the observed CMEs, i.e., a quasi-static inflation phase\nwhich corresponds to the buildup of magnetic free energy in the corona,\nfollowed by the frequently observed three-phase paradigm, including an initial\nphase, an acceleration phase and a gradual phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2010 13:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-12"}

Study of\njet production and properties in d+Au in combination with similar studies in\np+p is an important baseline measurement needed to better understand heavy-ion\nresults. We present mid-rapidity inclusive jet pT spectra and di-jet\ncorrelations (kT) in 200 GeV p+p and d+Au collisions from the 2007-2008 RHIC\nrun. We discuss the methods used to correct the data for detector effects and\nfor background in d+Au collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2010 15:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 22:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

We use the medial axis with a\nrelaxation factor as a reference path which is contingent on the states of the\nPUs. Along the axis, we construct a hierarchical structure for multiple sources\nto reach cognitive pilot channel (CPC) base stations. We use a temporal and\nspatial dynamic non-cooperative game to model the interactions among SUs as\nwell as their influences from PUs in the multi-hop structure of the network. A\nmulti-stage fictitious play learning is used for distributed routing in\nmulti-hop CR networks. We obtain a set of mixed (behavioral) Nash equilibrium\nstrategies of the dynamic game in closed form by backward induction. The\nproposed algorithm minimizes the overall interference and the average packet\ndelay along the routing path from SU nodes to CPC base stations in an optimal\nand distributed manner\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2010 05:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-01"}
