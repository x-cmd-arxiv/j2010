The\nshock could be nearly invisible to an HI, once entering the Thomson-scattering\nsphere of the HI. The asymmetry in the optical images between the western and\neastern HIs suggests the shock propagation off the Sun-Earth line.

Some of the key QMC achievements include direct treatment of\nelectron correlation, accuracy in predicting energy differences and favorable\nscaling in the system size. Calculations of atoms, molecules, clusters and\nsolids have demonstrated QMC applicability to real systems with hundreds of\nelectrons while providing 90-95% of the correlation energy and energy\ndifferences typically within a few percent of experiments. Advances in accuracy\nbeyond these limits are hampered by the so-called fixed-node approximation\nwhich is used to circumvent the notorious fermion sign problem. Many-body nodes\nof fermion states and their properties have therefore become one of the\nimportant topics for further progress in predictive power and efficiency of QMC\ncalculations. Some of our recent results on the wave function nodes and related\nnodal domain topologies will be briefly reviewed. This includes analysis of\nfew-electron systems and descriptions of exact and approximate nodes using\ntransformations and projections of the highly-dimensional nodal hypersurfaces\ninto the 3D space. Studies of fermion nodes offer new insights into topological\nproperties of eigenstates such as explicit demonstrations that generic\nfermionic ground states exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains.\nRecently proposed trial wave functions based on Pfaffians with pairing orbitals\nare presented and their nodal properties are tested in calculations of first\nrow atoms and molecules.

The work\nwas mainly based on a model independent systematic parametrization of\nscattering amplitudes and cross sections, for Standard Model particles, quarks\nand leptons, that were assumed to behave like strings, while gluons, photons,\n$W^{\\pm},Z$ were taken as elementary. By using Veneziano type beta functions\nconsistent with crossing symmetry, duality and Regge behavior, bosonic or\nfermionic resonances in each channel were included, while the low energy\nbehavior was matched to effective field theory non-renormalizable interactions\nconsistent with the Standard Model SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry as well as\nglobal flavor and family symmetries. The motivation for this approach at that\ntime was the possible compositeness of quarks and leptons but the same\nphenomenological approach would apply effectively with the modern additional\nmotivations for TeV scale strings, such as the hypothesis of D-branes with\nlarge extra dimensions. Because some of the main theoretical and\nphenomenological work of that time appeared only in the 1984 Snowmass and other\nproceedings, the results of the investigations have been inaccessible to most\nresearchers and consequently have been largely forgotten.

With a detection limit\nof L_X = 1E37 erg/s and a field of view covering a galactocentric radius of ~30\nkpc (11.5 arcminute), 383 sources are detected. Cross-correlation with Spitler\net al.'s catalogue of Sombrero globular clusters (GCs) identified from HST/ACS\nobservations reveals 41 X-rays sources in GCs, presumably low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). We quantify the differential luminosity functions (LFs) for\nboth the detected GC and field LMXBs, whose power-low indices (~1.1 for the\nGC-LF and ~1.6 for field-LF) are consistent with previous studies for\nelliptical galaxies.

However, identifying exactly how dust and gas dissipates is\ncomplicated due to difficulty in finding objects clearly in the transition of\nlosing their surrounding material. We use Spitzer IRS spectra to examine 35\nphotometrically-selected candidate cold disks (disks with large inner dust\nholes). The infrared spectra are supplemented with optical spectra to determine\nstellar and accretion properties and 1.3mm photometry to measure disk masses.\nBased on detailed SED modeling, we identify 15 new cold disks. The remaining 20\nobjects have IRS spectra that are consistent with disks without holes, disks\nthat are observed close to edge-on, or stars with background emission. Based on\nthese results, we determine reliable criteria for identifying disks with inner\nholes from Spitzer photometry and examine criteria already in the literature.\nApplying these criteria to the c2d surveyed star-forming regions gives a\nfrequency of such objects of at least 4% and most likely of order 12% of the\nYSO population identified by Spitzer.\n  We also examine the properties of these new cold disks in combination with\ncold disks from the literature. Hole sizes in this sample are generally smaller\nthan for previously discovered disks and reflect a distribution in better\nagreement with exoplanet orbit radii. We find correlations between hole size\nand both disk and stellar masses. Silicate features, including crystalline\nfeatures, are present in the overwhelming majority of the sample although 10\nmicron feature strength above the continuum declines for holes with radii\nlarger than ~7 AU.

While cold atomic gases provide a\nnew arena for exploring the nature of BEC, a long-term quest to confirm BEC of\nexcitons, quasi-Bose particles formed as a bound state of an electron-hole\npair, has been underway since its theoretical prediction in the 1960s.\nEnsembles of electrons and holes are complex quantum systems with strong\nCoulomb correlations; thus, it is non-trivial whether nature chooses a form of\nexciton BEC. Various systems have been examined in bulk and two-dimensional\nsemiconductors and also exciton-photon hybrid systems.

Such a system with a large inelastic cross\nsection is excluded in atomic BEC experiments, where a small inelastic\nscattering rate and efficient elastic scattering are necessary for evaporative\ncooling. Here we demonstrate that it is nevertheless possible to achieve BEC by\ncooling paraexcitons to sub-Kelvin temperatures in a cold phonon bath. Emission\nspectra from paraexcitons in a three-dimensional trap show an anomalous\ndistribution in a threshold-like manner at the critical number of BEC expected\nfor ideal bosons.

To train the machine learning\nalgorithms, we use previously published spectroscopic identifications of BHB\nstars from SDSS data. We investigate the performance of three different\ntechniques, namely k nearest neighbour classification, kernel density\nestimation and a support vector machine (SVM). We discuss the performance of\nthe methods in terms of both completeness and contamination. We discuss the\nprospect of trading off these values, achieving lower contamination at the\nexpense of lower completeness, by adjusting probability thresholds for the\nclassification. We also discuss the role of prior probabilities in the\nclassification performance, and we assess via simulations the reliability of\nthe dataset used for training. Overall it seems that no-prior gives the best\ncompleteness, but adopting a prior lowers the contamination. We find that the\nSVM generally delivers the lowest contamination for a given level of\ncompleteness, and so is our method of choice. Finally, we classify a large\nsample of SDSS DR7 photometry using the SVM trained on the spectroscopic\nsample. We identify 27,074 probable BHB stars out of a sample of 294,652 stars.\nWe derive photometric parallaxes and demonstrate that our results are\nreasonable by comparing to known distances for a selection of globular\nclusters. We attach our classifications, including probabilities, as an\nelectronic table, so that they can be used either directly as a BHB star\ncatalogue, or as priors to a spectroscopic or other classification method. We\nalso provide our final models so that they can be directly applied to new data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2010 13:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
