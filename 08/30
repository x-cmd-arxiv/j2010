We calibrate and\ntest these relationships on an array of different protonation states of the\ngreen fluorescent protein chromophore motif (an asymmetric halochromic methine\ndye) and its symmetric parent dyes. The relationships rely on the assumption\nthat the diabatic states that define the Platt model for methine dye color\n[J.R. Platt, J. Chem. Phys. 25 80 (1956)] can also be distinguished by their\nsingle-double bond alternation and by their charge localization character.\nThese assumptions are independent of the primary constraint that defines the\ndiabatic states in the Platt model - specifically, the Brooker deviation rule\nfor methine dyes [L.G.S. Brooker, Rev. Mod. Phys. 14 275 (1942)]. Taking these\nassumptions, we show that the Platt model offers an alternate route to known\nstructure-property relationships between the bond length alternation and the\nquadratic nonlinear polarizability {\\beta}. We show also that the Platt model\ncan be parameterized without the need for synthesis of the symmetric parents of\na given dye, using dipole data obtained through spectroscopic measurements.\nThis suggests that the Platt model parameters may be used as independent\nvariables in free-energy relationships for chromophores whose symmetric parents\ncannot be synthesized or chromophores strongly bound to biomolecular\nenvironments.

Based on this observation, we\npropose using $l_1/l_2$ regularization upon the activation possibilities of\nhidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the loacal\ndependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden\nunits of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden\nunits within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus,\nthe $l_1/l_2$ regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the\nhidden unit levels.

These arise from the conformal scalar\ndegrees of freedom in the extended effective field theory of gravity generated\nby the trace anomaly of massless quantum fields in curved space. The origin of\nthese conformal scalar degrees of freedom as massless poles in two-particle\nintermediate states of anomalous amplitudes in flat space is exposed. At event\nhorizons the conformal anomaly scalar degrees of freedom can have\nmacroscopically large effects on the geometry, potentially removing the\nclassical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes, replacing\nthem with a quantum boundary layer where the effective value of the\ngravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory, the\ncosmological term becomes a dynamical condensate, whose value depends upon\nboundary conditions near the horizon. In the conformal phase where the anomaly\ninduced fluctutations dominate, and the condensate dissolves, the effective\ncosmological \"constant\" is a running coupling which has an infrared stable\nfixed point at zero. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully\ncollapsed star, the effective cosmological term removes any singularity,\nreplacing it with a smooth dark energy interior. The resulting gravitational\ncondensate star configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes, and provides a\ntestable alternative to black holes as the final state of complete\ngravitational collapse. The observed dark energy of our universe likewise may\nbe a macroscopic finite size effect whose value depends not on microphysics but\non the cosmological horizon scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 05:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

However, the cool cores of galaxy clusters are continuously\nheated by thermal conduction and turbulent heat diffusion due to minor mergers\nor the galaxies orbiting the cluster center. These processes can either reduce\nthe energy requirements for AGN heating of cool cores, or they can prevent\novercooling altogether. We perform 3D MHD simulations including field-aligned\nthermal conduction and self-gravitating particles to model this in detail.\nTurbulence is not confined to the wakes of galaxies but is instead\nvolume-filling, due to the excitation of large-scale g-modes. We systematically\nprobe the parameter space of galaxy masses and numbers. For a wide range of\nobservationally motivated galaxy parameters, the magnetic field is randomized\nby stirring motions, restoring the conductive heat flow to the core. The\ncooling catastrophe either does not occur or it is sufficiently delayed to\nallow the cluster to experience a major merger that could reset conditions in\nthe intracluster medium. Whilst dissipation of turbulent motions is negligible\nas a heat source, turbulent heat diffusion is extremely important; it\npredominates in the cluster center. However, thermal conduction becomes\nimportant at larger radii, and simulations without thermal conduction suffer a\ncooling catastrophe. Conduction is important both as a heat source and to\nreduce stabilizing buoyancy forces, enabling more efficient diffusion.\nTurbulence enables conduction, and conduction enables turbulence. In these\nsimulations, the gas vorticity---which is a good indicator of trapped\ng-modes--increases with time. The vorticity growth is approximately mirrored by\nthe growth of the magnetic field, which is amplified by turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 07:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this paper we consider the\nproblem of finding normal forms and functional invariants at each type of\npoint. We also require that functional invariants are \"complete\" in the sense\nthat they permit to recognize locally isometric structures. The problem happens\nto be equivalent to the one of finding a smooth canonical parameterized curve\npassing through the point and being transversal to the distribution. For\nRiemannian points such that the gradient of the Gaussian curvature $K$ is\ndifferent from zero, we use the level set of $K$ as support of the\nparameterized curve. For Riemannian points such that the gradient of the\ncurvature vanishes (and under additional generic conditions), we use a curve\nwhich is found by looking for crests and valleys of the curvature. For Grushin\npoints we use the set where the vector fields are parallel. Tangency points are\nthe most complicated to deal with. The cut locus from the tangency point is not\na good candidate as canonical parameterized curve since it is known to be\nnon-smooth. Thus, we analyse the cut locus from the singular set and we prove\nthat it is not smooth either. A good candidate appears to be a curve which is\nfound by looking for crests and valleys of the Gaussian curvature.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc. Unusually for a classical double (FRII) radio source,\nthere is smooth low surface-brightness radio emission associated with the\nregions beyond the hotspots (further away from the nucleus than the hotspots\nthemselves), which seems to be symmetric for the ends of both jets. We consider\npossible explanations for this phenomenon, and conclude that it arises from\nhigh-energy electrons, recently accelerated in the nearby radio hotspots that\nare leaking into a pre-existing weakly-magnetized plasma that are symmetric\nrelic lobes fed from a previous episode of jet activity.

The cost of a query is the sum of the costs of the entries\nthat are read from the hidden relation. A novel aspect of this work is that we\nconsider prior information about the values in the hidden matrix.

The main result is that spike trains statistics are\ncharacterized by a Gibbs distribution, whose potential is explicitly\ncomputable. This establishes, on one hand, a rigorous ground for the current\ninvestigations attempting to characterize real spike trains data with Gibbs\ndistributions, such as the Ising-like distribution, using the maximal entropy\nprinciple. However, it transpires from the present analysis that the Ising\nmodel might be a rather weak approximation. Indeed, the Gibbs potential (the\nformal \"Hamiltonian\") is the log of the so-called \"conditional intensity\" (the\nprobability that a neuron fires given the past of the whole network). But, in\nthe present example, this probability has an infinite memory, and the\ncorresponding process is non-Markovian (resp. the Gibbs potential has infinite\nrange). Moreover, causality implies that the conditional intensity does not\ndepend on the state of the neurons at the \\textit{same time}, ruling out the\nIsing model as a candidate for an exact characterization of spike trains\nstatistics. However, Markovian approximations can be proposed whose degree of\napproximation can be rigorously controlled. In this setting, Ising model\nappears as the \"next step\" after the Bernoulli model (independent neurons)\nsince it introduces spatial pairwise correlations, but not time correlations.\nThe range of validity of this approximation is discussed together with possible\napproaches allowing to introduce time correlations, with algorithmic\nextensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 13:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}

The outflow velocities of these warm absorbers are\nabout 450 km/s, consistent with the three absorption components found in a\nprevious far UV study. The ionizing continuum of Mrk 290 fluctuated by a factor\nof 1.4 during Chandra observations on a time scale of 17 days. Thus, we put a\nlower limit on the distance from the ionizing source of 0.9 pc for the medium\nionized absorber and an upper limit on distance of 2.5 pc for the lowest\nionized absorber. The three ionization components lie on the stable branch of\nthe thermal equilibrium curve, indicating that the torus is most likely the\norigin of warm absorbing gas in Mrk 290. During the XMM-Newton observation, the\nionizing luminosity was 50% lower compared to the one in the Chandra\nobservation. Neither the ionization parameter nor the column density of the two\nabsorbing components varied significantly, compared to the results from Chandra\nobservations. However, the outflow velocities of both components were 1260\nkm/s. We suggest that an entirely new warm absorber from the torus passed\nthrough our line of sight.

By assuming an order\none anarchical complex 5D Yukawa couplings, all the effective 4D Yukawa\ncouplings are determined by the wave function overlap between the split\nfermions and the bulk scalars in the fifth dimension. The predictability of the\nYukawa couplings is in sharp contrast to the original Zee model in 4D where the\nYukawa couplings are unknown free parameters. This setup exhibits a geometrical\nalternative to the lepton flavor symmetry. By giving four explicit sets of the\nsplit fermion locations, we demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously\nfit the lepton masses and neutrino oscillation data by just a handful free\nparameters without much fine tuning.
