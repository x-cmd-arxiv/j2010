We derive the projected rotational velocity $V\\sin i$,\neffective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed $V_{\\rm\ncrit}$ for each star. We find that the average $V\\sin i$ is significantly lower\namong field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down\nthan their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of\n$V_{\\rm eq}/V_{\\rm crit}$ for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B\nstars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B\nstars. However, the upper limit of $V_{\\rm eq}/V_{\\rm crit}$ that may separate\nnormal B stars from emission line Be stars (where rotation promotes mass loss\ninto a circumstellar disk) is smaller among the higher mass B stars. We compare\nthe evolutionary trends of rotation (measured according to the polar gravity of\nthe star) with recent models that treat internal mixing. The spin-down rates\nobserved in the high mass subset ($\\sim 9 M_\\odot$) agree with predictions, but\nthe rates are larger for the low mass group ($\\sim 3 M_\\odot$).

(2008)\nassumed that the absorption of electrons by hypothetical circum-Rhea particles\nis proportional to the volume of the particles, even when they are much larger\nthan the electron penetration depth (van Allen 1983, 1987, JGR). If we assume\ninstead that large particles can only absorb electrons efficiently near their\nsurfaces, then our results rule out any solid material orbiting Rhea as the\nexplanation for the absorptions detected by Jones et al. (2008), regardless of\nparticle size, by a margin of four (for narrow rings) or two (for a broad\ndiffuse cloud) orders of magnitude. We conclude that the anomalous electron\nabsorptions reported by Jones et al. (2008) are the signature of a new and\nhitherto unknown magnetospheric process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 18:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-11"}

The\nresulting quasi-one-dimensional spin model is a two-leg AFM ladder with\nfrustrating next-nearest-neighbor couplings along the legs. The individual\ncouplings are estimated from band structure calculations and by fitting the\nmagnetic susceptibility with theoretical predictions, obtained using ED. The\nnearest-neighbor leg coupling J1, the rung coupling J4, and one of the\nnext-nearest-neighbor couplings J2 amount to 120-150 K, while the second\nnext-nearest-neighbor coupling is J2'~J2/2. The spin ladders do not match the\nstructural chains, and although the next-nearest-neighbor interactions J2 and\nJ2' have very similar superexchange pathways, they differ substantially in\nmagnitude due to a tiny difference in the O-O distances and in the arrangement\nof non-magnetic PO4 tetrahedra. An extensive ED study of the proposed model\nprovides the low-energy excitation spectrum and shows that the system is in the\nstrong rung coupling regime. The strong frustration by the\nnext-nearest-neighbor couplings leads to a triplon branch with an\nincommensurate minimum. This is further corroborated by a strong-coupling\nexpansion up to second order in the inter-rung coupling.

To this end, the enlarged algebra of\nobservables of the Dirac field is constructed in the algebraic framework. This\nalgebra contains normal-ordered Wick polynomials in particular, and an extended\nanalysis of one of its elements, the stress-energy tensor, is performed. Based\non detailed calculations of the Hadamard coefficients of the Dirac field, it is\nfound that a construction of a stress-energy tensor fulfilling necessary\nphysical properties is possible. Additionally, the mathematically sound\nHadamard regularisation prescription of the stress-energy tensor is compared to\nthe mathematically less rigorous DeWitt-Schwinger regularisation and it is\nfound that both prescriptions are essentially equivalent in rigorous terms.\n  While the aforementioned results hold in generic curved spacetimes,\nparticular attention is also devoted to a specific class of Robertson-Walker\nspacetimes with a lightlike Big Bang hypersurface. Employing holographic\nmethods, Hadamard states for the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac field are\nconstructed. These states are preferred in the sense that they constitute\nasymptotic equilibrium states in the limit to the Big Bang hypersurface.\nFinally, solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equation for quantum fields of\narbitrary spin are analysed in the flat Robertson-Walker case. One finds that\nthese solutions explain the measured supernova Ia data as good as the $\\La$CDM\nmodel. Hence, one arrives at a natural explanation of dark energy and a simple\nquantum model of cosmological dark matter.\n  It is the hope of the author that the present thesis can serve as an\naccessible introduction to the field of (algebraic) quantum field theory on\ncurved spacetimes and its recent developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 19:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-22"}

In proof complexity, these resources\ncorrespond to the length and space of resolution proofs. There has been a long\nline of research investigating these proof complexity measures, but while\nstrong results have been established for length, our understanding of space and\nhow it relates to length has remained quite poor. In particular, the question\nwhether resolution proofs can be optimized for length and space simultaneously,\nor whether there are trade-offs between these two measures, has remained\nessentially open.\n  In this paper, we remedy this situation by proving a host of length-space\ntrade-off results for resolution. Our collection of trade-offs cover almost the\nwhole range of values for the space complexity of formulas, and most of the\ntrade-offs are superpolynomial or even exponential and essentially tight. Using\nsimilar techniques, we show that these trade-offs in fact extend to the\nexponentially stronger k-DNF resolution proof systems, which operate with\nformulas in disjunctive normal form with terms of bounded arity k. We also\nanswer the open question whether the k-DNF resolution systems form a strict\nhierarchy with respect to space in the affirmative.\n  Our key technical contribution is the following, somewhat surprising,\ntheorem: Any CNF formula F can be transformed by simple variable substitution\ninto a new formula F' such that if F has the right properties, F' can be proven\nin essentially the same length as F, whereas on the other hand the minimal\nnumber of lines one needs to keep in memory simultaneously in any proof of F'\nis lower-bounded by the minimal number of variables needed simultaneously in\nany proof of F.

We present a spectral analysis of G21.5-0.9, using the longest\neffective observation to date (578.6 ks with ACIS, 278.4 ks with HRC) to study\nunresolved questions about the spectral nature of remnant features, such as the\nlimb-brightening of the X-ray halo and the bright knot in the northern part of\nthe halo.

Our spectroscopic study of J1833-1034, the highly energetic pulsar powering\nG21.5-0.9, shows that its spectrum is dominated by hard non-thermal X-ray\nemission with some evidence of a thermal component that represents ~9% of the\nobserved non-thermal emission and that suggests non-standard rapid cooling of\nthe neutron star. Finally, the ACIS and HRC-I images provide the first evidence\nfor variability in the PWN, a property observed in other PWNe such as the Crab\nand Vela.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 20:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 16:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Fingering convection is also often associated with\nstructures on much larger scales, such as thermohaline intrusions, gravity\nwaves and thermohaline staircases.

We perform the first\nthree-dimensional simulations of the process at realistic values of the heat\nand salt diffusivities and provide accurate estimates of the induced turbulent\ntransport. Our results are consistent with oceanic field measurements of\ndiapycnal mixing in fingering regions.

The theory recovers the intrusive instability, the\ncollective instability, and the gamma-instability as limiting cases. We find\nthat the fastest-growing large-scale mode depends sensitively on the ratio of\nthe background gradients of temperature and salinity (the density ratio).

Decades after their\ndiscovery, however, their origin remains controversial. In this paper we use 3D\ndirect numerical simulations to shed light on the problem. We study the\nevolution of an analogous double-diffusive system, starting from an initial\nstatistically homogeneous fingering state and find that it spontaneously\ntransforms into a layered state. By analysing our results in the light of the\nmean-field theory developed in Paper I, a clear picture of the sequence of\nevents resulting in the staircase formation emerges. A collective instability\nof homogeneous fingering convection first excites a field of gravity waves,\nwith a well-defined vertical wavelength. However, the waves saturate early\nthrough regular but localized breaking events, and are not directly responsible\nfor the formation of the staircase. Meanwhile, slower-growing, horizontally\ninvariant but vertically quasi-periodic gamma-modes are also excited and grow\naccording to the gamma-instability mechanism. Our results suggest that the\nnonlinear interaction between these various mean-field modes of instability\nleads to the selection of one particular gamma-mode as the staircase\nprogenitor. Upon reaching a critical amplitude, this progenitor overturns into\na fully-formed staircase. We conclude by extending the results of our\nsimulations to real oceanic parameter values, and find that the progenitor\ngamma-mode is expected to grow on a timescale of a few hours, and leads to the\nformation of a thermohaline staircase in about one day with an initial spacing\nof the order of one to two metres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 21:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Several models are\nbeing proposed to explain this discrepancy, involving either new physics, in\nsitu depletion, or the efficient depletion of Li in the pristine Galaxy by a\ngeneration of massive first stars. The realm of possibilities may be narrowed\nconsiderably by observing stellar populations in different galaxies, which have\nexperienced different evolutionary histories.\n  The WCen stellar system is commonly considered as the remnant of a dwarf\ngalaxy accreted by the Milky Way (MW). We investigate the Li content of a\nconspicuous sample of unevolved stars in this object.\n  We obtained moderate resolution (R=17000) spectra for 91 main-sequence/early\nsub-giant branch (MS/SGB) WCen stars using the FLAMES-GIRAFFE/VLT spectrograph.\nLi abundances were derived by matching the equivalent width of the LiI\nresonance doublet at 6708A, to the prediction of synthetic spectra computed\nwith different Li abundances. Synthetic spectra were computed using the SYNTHE\ncode along with ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The stars effective temperatures are\nderived by fitting the wings of the Ha line with synthetic profiles.\n  We obtain a mean content of A(Li)=2.19+-0.14~dex for WCen MS/SGB stars.

It exists also in external galaxies, if we accept the current view about\nthe origin of WCen. This implies that the mechanism(s) that causes the\n\"cosmological lithium problem\" may be the same in the MW and other galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 00:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

For such games we show how one can compute\napproximate Nash equilibria more efficiently than the general result of Lipton\net al. \\cite{LMM03}, by an amount that depends on the degree of stability of\nthe game and that reduces to their bound in the worst case. Furthermore, we\nshow that for stable games the approximate equilibria found will be close in\nvariation distance to true equilibria, and moreover this holds even if we are\ngiven as input only a perturbation of the actual underlying stable game.\n  For uniformly-stable games, where the equilibria fluctuate at most\nquasi-linearly in the extent of the perturbation, we get a particularly\ndramatic improvement.

(STOC10) recently showed that sequential posted-price mechanisms\n(SPMs), though simple in form, can perform surprisingly well compared to the\noptimal mechanisms. In this paper, we give a theoretical explanation of this\nfact, based on a connection to the notion of correlation gap.\n  Loosely speaking, for auction environments with matroid constraints, we can\nrelate the performance of a mechanism to the expectation of a monotone\nsubmodular function over a random set. This random set corresponds to the\nwinner set for the optimal mechanism, which is highly correlated, and\ncorresponds to certain demand set for SPMs, which is independent. The notion of\ncorrelation gap of Agrawal et al.\\ (SODA10) quantifies how much we {}\"lose\" in\nthe expectation of the function by ignoring correlation in the random set, and\nhence bounds our loss in using certain SPM instead of the optimal mechanism.\nFurthermore, the correlation gap of a monotone and submodular function is known\nto be small, and it follows that certain SPM can approximate the optimal\nmechanism by a good constant factor.\n  Exploiting this connection, we give tight analysis of a greedy-based SPM of\nChawla et al.\\ for several environments. In particular, we show that it gives\nan $e/(e-1)$-approximation for matroid environments, gives asymptotically a\n$1/(1-1/\\sqrt{2\\pi k})$-approximation for the important sub-case of $k$-unit\nauctions, and gives a $(p+1)$-approximation for environments with\n$p$-independent set system constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 07:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 08:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}

The holes are found throughout the disks of the\ngalaxies, out to the edge of the HI; 23% of the holes fall outside R25. We find\nthat shear limits the age of holes in spirals (shear is less important in dwarf\ngalaxies) which explains why HI holes in dwarfs are rounder, on average than in\nspirals. Shear, which is particularly strong in the inner part of spiral\ngalaxies, also explains why we find that holes outside R25 are larger and\nolder. We derive the scale height of the HI disk as a function of\ngalactocentric radius and find that the disk flares up in all galaxies.

For $g$ of type\n$A_n$ or $C_n$, we provide a combinatorial explanation of this coincidence by\nconstructing a suitable bijection.

It results\nclearly that the experiment demonstrated the main decay of the Y resonance to\nbe mediated by 3 gluons hadronizing into 3 jets. Jettiness resulted evident by\nthe <P_T> with respect to the thrust axis, which was as observed by PLUTO\nitself at nearby continuum c.m.s. energies for 2-quark jet events. Instead, the\naverage sphericity <S>, more topological variables and the momentum\ndistribution showed a net difference with the same data, results compatible\nwith jettiness only in case of more than 2 jets. Flatness as consequence of a\n3-body decay (therefore 3 jets) was indicated by the low <P_out>, altogether a\nresult independent of models. The charged multiplicity was observed to be\nlarger than in the continuum and in case of MC 3 gluon jets fragmenting like\nquarks, as expected for gluon jets. In June 1979 PLUTO measured the matrix\nelement of the 3-gluon decay to be quantitatively according QCD (even after\nhadronization, which does not obscure the perturbative predictions) and\ndemonstrated the spin 1 nature of the gluon by excluding spin 0 and spin 1/2.\nThe gluon hadronization like a quark jet, as in 3-gluon jet MC, was compatible\nwith topological data and multiplicity; this was the first experimental study\nof (identified) gluon jets.

The magnetic coupling with\nthe disc is thought to influence the rotational evolution of the star, while\nmagnetised stellar winds control the braking of more evolved stars and may\ninfluence the migration of planets. Magnetic reconnection events trigger\nenergetic flares which irradiate circumstellar discs with high energy particles\nthat influence the disc chemistry and set the initial conditions for planet\nformation.

The intraspecific competition has a\nstrongly stabilizing effect on the system, whereas the variable conversion\nefficiency resulting from a variable food quality is the main determinant for\nthe nature of the instability once destabilization occurs.

While the dominant instability\ndepends on the microscopic values of the couplings, the broken symmetry state\nis typically a gapped insulator with either broken inversion symmetry or broken\ntime reversal symmetry, with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. Under certain\nconditions, the dominant instability may appear in the particle-particle\n(pairing) channel. For some non-generic fine-tuned initial conditions, weak\ncoupling RG trajectories flow into the non-interacting fixed point, although\ngenerally we find runaway flows which we associate with ordering tendencies.\nAdditionally, a tight binding model with nearest neighbor hopping and nearest\nneighbor repulsion is studied in weak and strong couplings and in each regime a\ngapped phase with inversion symmetry breaking is found.

These interactions are\ntypical of warm inflation microscopic model building. Two perturbative regimes\nare shown where well defined approximations for the spectral functions apply.\nOne regime is at high temperature, when the masses of both intermediate and\nradiation fields are less than the temperature scale and where the poles of the\nspectral functions dominate. The other regime is at low temperature, when the\nintermediate field masses are much bigger than the temperature and where the\nlow energy and low three-momentum regime dominate the spectral functions. The\ndissipation coefficients in these two regimes are derived. However, due to\nresummation issues for the high temperature case, only phenomenological\napproximate estimates are provided for the dissipation in this regime. In the\nlow temperature case, higher loop contributions are suppressed and so no\nresummation is necessary. In addition to inflationary cosmology, the\napplication of our results to cosmological phase transitions is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 14:57:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 00:14:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 20:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 12:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

Our numerical\nsimulations show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly\ndetected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover the previous\nclassification of two universality classes works for CLVs as well, i.e. the\ndispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian systems and quadratic for\ndissipative systems respectively. The significance of HLMs changes in different\nways for Hamiltonian and dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs by\nCLVs. For general dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long wave\nlength structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov\nexponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for highly\nhyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is nearly identical for\nCLVs and OLVs.

This\npaper answers this question when p is fixed and n tends to infinity by\nestablishing a large deviation principle under an appropriate topology. The\nformulation and proof of the main result uses the recent development of the\ntheory of graph limits by Lovasz and coauthors and Szemeredi's regularity lemma\nfrom graph theory. As a basic application of the general principle, we work out\nlarge deviations for the number of triangles in G(n,p). Surprisingly, even this\nsimple example yields an interesting double phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 15:56:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 22:21:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 02:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

In the description with\nthe algebra of octonions, the inferences of wave equations are identical with\nthat in conventional electromagnetic theory with vector terminology. By means\nof the octonion exponential function, we can draw out that the electromagnetic\nwaves are transverse waves in a vacuum, and rephrase the law of reflection,\nSnell's law, Fresnel formula, and total internal reflection etc. The study\nclaims that the theoretical results of wave equations for electromagnetic\nstrength keep unchanged in the case for coexistence of gravitational and\nelectromagnetic fields. Meanwhile the electric and magnetic components of\nelectromagnetic waves can not be determined simultaneously in electromagnetic\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 07:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-13"}

In this paper, we will try\nto classify the complexity of inversion into 3 different classes. We will use\nsynthetic models based on well control to illustrate the different classes. The\nfirst class is systems which have a group of symmetry. This class has clean\ninversion. We will use two examples which include 2-term AVO on 1-D layers as\nan example. The second class does not have a group support. It is in general\ndescribed by a semigroup which is a set of operators with or without inverses.\nThere is no guarantee in general of invertibility in a global sense. Even\nthough this class does not have invertibility in general, there could still be\nlocal weak invertibility embedded in the semigroup. The last class is system\nwith complex topology where the underlying topology/geometry requires infinite\nconstruction. In our previous 2005 paper, we gave the 1-D Cantor layers as the\nforerunner of all complex topological interface. We will re-examine this last\nclass in detail. The idea of constructing the Cantor layers as inverse limit\nwas introduced in the previous paper. We will examine the finite approximation\nof the Cantor layers and its implication on inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 12:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}
