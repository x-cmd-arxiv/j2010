In this regard, we consider different\nconnectivity parameters called {\\it minimum normalized cuts}/{\\it isoperimteric\nnumbers} defined through taking minimum of the maximum or the mean of the\nnormalized outgoing flows from a set of subdomains of vertices, where these\nsubdomains constitute a {\\it partition}/{\\it subpartition}. Following the main\nresult of [A. Daneshgar, {\\it et. al.}, {\\it On the isoperimetric spectrum of\ngraphs and its approximations}, JCTB, (2010)], it is known that the\nisoperimetric number and the minimum normalized cut both can be described as\n$\\{0,1\\}$-optimization programs, where the latter one does {\\it not} admit a\nrelaxation to the reals. We show that the decision problem for the case of\ntaking $k$-partitions and the maximum (called the max normalized cut problem\n{\\rm NCP}$^M$) as well as the other two decision problems for the mean version\n(referred to as {\\rm IPP}$^m$ and {\\rm NCP}$^m$) are $NP$-complete problems. On\nthe other hand, we show that the decision problem for the case of taking\n$k$-subpartitions and the maximum (called the max isoperimetric problem {\\rm\nIPP}$^M$) can be solved in {\\it linear time} for any weighted tree and any $k\n\\geq 2$. Based on this fact, we provide polynomial time $O(k)$-approximation\nalgorithms for all different versions of $k$th isoperimetric numbers\nconsidered. Moreover, when the number of partitions/subpartitions, $k$, is a\nfixed constant, as an extension of a result of B. Mohar (1989) for the case\n$k=2$ (usually referred to as the Cheeger constant), we prove that max and mean\nisoperimetric numbers of weighted trees as well as their max normalized cut can\nbe computed in polynomial time. We also prove some hardness results for the\ncase of simple unweighted graphs and trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 16:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-06"}

Each of these\nmisalignment patterns is characterized by an associated two-dimensional vector,\neach of which in turn is a linear combination of the tilt and decenter vectors\nof the individual optical elements. For an N-mirror telescope, 2(N-1) patterns\nmust be measured to keep the telescope aligned. Alignment of the focal plane\nmay require two additional patterns. For N = 3, as in a three mirror\nanastigmat, there is a two-dimensional \"subspace of benign misalignment\" over\nwhich the misalignment patterns for third-order coma, astigmatism and curvature\nof field are identically zero. One would need to measure at least one of the\ntwo distortion patterns to keep the telescope aligned.

More recently, a\nnew technique has been introduced that relies on the accurate measurement of\nthe gravitational flexion that corresponds to the second-order distortion of\nthe background galaxy images. This technique should probe structures on smaller\nscales than that of a shear analysis. The goal of this paper is to compare the\nability of shear and flexion to reconstruct the dark matter distribution by\ntaking into account the dispersion in shear and flexion measurements.

This study makes use of a IRDC catalogue (Peretto & Fuller\n2009), the largest sample of IRDC column density maps to date, containing a\ntotal of ~11,000 IRDCs with column densities exceeding N_{H2} = 1 X10^{22}\ncm^{-2} and over 50,000 single peaked IRDC fragments.

Using a statistical approach to assigning distances to clouds, the\nmass and density distributions of the clouds and the fragments within them are\nconstructed. The mass distributions show a steepening of the slope when\nswitching from IRDCs to fragments, in agreement with previous results of\nsimilar structures. IRDCs and fragments are divided into unbound/bound objects\nby assuming Larson's relation and calculating their virial parameter.

We probe the reliability of the method by\ncomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same set\nof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.We applied two different\nmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zCOSMOS\nredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.3. The first method is the\ncombination of three independent classification schemes, while the second\nmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses like\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and Unsupervised Fuzzy Partition (UFP)\nclustering method. The PCA+UFP method has been applied also to a lower redshift\nsample (z < 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,\nreplaced by the equivalent width of H$\\alpha$. The comparison between the two\nmethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,\nthe early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. Our PCA-UFP method of\nclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two main\npopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. The\nintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valley\ngalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. The\nfairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold the\ndownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\\cdot 10^{10}$ Msun\nmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at\n$z>0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ Msun -\nare in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $M <10^{10}$ Msun did not\nbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($M > 5\\cdot\n10^{10}$ Msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\\sim 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 17:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2011 11:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-26"}

While both approaches have identical\nsignal-to-noise in the weak lensing limit, it is possible that higher order\ncorrections or systematics considerations make one estimator preferable over\nthe other. In this paper, we consider the efficacy of both estimators within\nthe context of stacked weak lensing mass estimation in the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES). We find the two estimators have nearly identical statistical precision,\neven after including higher order corrections, but that these corrections must\nbe incorporated into the analysis to avoid observationally relevant biases in\nthe recovered masses.

Thus, the two estimators may be employed as a\nsystematics cross-check of each other.

In\norder to properly interpret the abundance and properties of these peaks, it is\nnecessary to take into account the effects of the clustering of source\ngalaxies, among themselves and with the lens. In addition, the preferred\nselection of lensed galaxies in a flux- and size-limited sample leads to\nfluctuations in the apparent source density which correlate with the lensing\nfield (lensing bias). In this paper, we investigate these issues for two\ndifferent choices of shear estimators which are commonly in use today:\nglobally-normalized and locally-normalized estimators. While in principle\nequivalent, in practice these estimators respond differently to systematic\neffects such as lensing bias and cluster member dilution. Furthermore, we find\nthat which estimator is statistically superior depends on the specific shape of\nthe filter employed for peak finding; suboptimal choices of the\nestimator+filter combination can result in a suppression of the number of high\npeaks by orders of magnitude.

Many such\nscenarios predict a high-redshift population of massive black holes (MBHs),\nwith masses in the range 100 to 100000 times that of the Sun. When the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is finally operational, it is likely that\nit will detect on the order of 100 of these MBH binaries as they merge. The\ndifferences between proposed population models produce appreciable effects in\nthe portion of the population which is detectable by LISA, so it is likely that\nthe LISA observations will allow us to place constraints on them. However,\ngravitational wave detectors such as LISA will not be able to detect all such\nmergers nor assign precise black hole parameters to the merger, due to weak\ngravitational wave signal strengths. This paper explores LISA's ability to\ndistinguish between several MBH population models. In this way, we go beyond\npredicting a LISA observed population and consider the extent to which LISA\nobservations could inform astrophysical modellers. The errors in LISA parameter\nestimation are applied with a direct method which generates random sample\nparameters for each source in a population realisation. We consider how the\ndistinguishability varies depending on the choice of source parameters (1 or 2\nparameters chosen from masses, redshift or spins) used to characterise the\nmodel distributions, with confidence levels determined by 1 and 2-dimensional\ntests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 20:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Nevertheless, observational confirmations are\nrare, especially for binaries with separations less than ten kpc. Such a system\nmay show two sets of narrow emission lines in a single spectrum owing to the\norbital motion of the binary. We have obtained high-resolution near-infrared\nimages of 50 double-peaked [O III] 5007 AGNs with the Keck II laser guide star\nadaptive optics system. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey sample is compiled from\nthe literature and consists of 17 type-1 AGNs between 0.18 < z < 0.56 and 33\ntype-2 AGNs between 0.03 < z < 0.24. The new images reveal eight type-1 and\neight type-2 sources that are apparently undergoing mergers. These are strong\ncandidates of kpc-scale binary AGNs, because they show multiple components\nseparated between 0.6 and 12 kpc and often disturbed morphologies. Because most\nof the type-1s are at higher redshifts than the type-2s, the higher merger\nfraction of type-1s (47+/-20%) compared to that of type-2s (24+/-10%) can be\nattributed to the general evolution of galaxy merger fraction with redshift.\nFurthermore, we show that AGN mergers are outliers of the M_BH-sigma relation\nbecause of over-estimated stellar velocity dispersions, illustrating the\nimportance of removing mergers from the samples defining the M_BH-sigma\nrelations. Finally, we find that the emission-line properties are\nindistinguishable for spatially resolved and unresolved sources, emphasizing\nthat scenarios involving a single AGN can produce the same double-peaked line\nprofiles and they account for at least 70% of the double-peaked [O III] AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 20:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 20:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

With\nthis representation, every solid model can be effectively presented by three\nlayered depth-normal images (LDNIs) that are perpendicular to three orthogonal\naxes respectively. The layered depth-normal images for a solid model, whose\nboundary is presented by a polygonal mesh, can be generated efficiently with\nhelp of the graphics hardware accelerated sampling. Based on this implicit\nrepresentation - LDNIs, solid modeling operations including the Boolean\noperations and the offsetting operation have been developed. A contouring\nalgorithm is also introduced in this paper to generate thin structure and sharp\nfeature preserved mesh surfaces from the layered depth-normal images.\nComparisons between LDNIs and other implicit representation of solid models are\ngiven at the end of the paper to demonstrate the advantages of LDNIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 01:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

Time-independent\nor memoryless master equations, in particular, can be cast in the well-known\nLindblad form. Any time-local master equation, Markovian or non-Markovian, may\nin fact also be written in a Lindblad-like form. A diagonalisation procedure\nresults in a unique, and in this sense canonical, representation of the\nequation, which may be used to fully characterize the non-Markovianity of the\ntime evolution. Recently, several different measures of non-Markovianity have\nbeen presented which reflect, to varying degrees, the appearance of negative\ndecoherence rates in the Lindblad-like form of the master equation. We\ntherefore propose using the negative decoherence rates themselves, as they\nappear in the canonical form of the master equation, to completely characterize\nnon-Markovianity. The advantages of this are especially apparent when more than\none decoherence channel is present. We show that a measure proposed by Rivas et\nal. is a surprisingly simple function of the canonical decoherence rates, and\ngive an example of a master equation that is non-Markovian for all times t>0,\nbut to which nearly all proposed measures are blind. We also give necessary and\nsufficient conditions for trace distance and volume measures to witness\nnon-Markovianity, in terms of the Bloch damping matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 15:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 12:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 18:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 07:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}
