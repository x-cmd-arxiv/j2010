A major\nchallenge is to make the step from code-driven to model-driven systems. This is\nessential to replace hand-crafted single-unit systems by systems composed out\nof components with explicitly stated properties. Furthermore, this fosters\nreuse by separating robotics knowledge from short-cycled implementational\ntechnologies. Altogether, this is one but important step towards \"able\" robots.\nThis paper reports on a model-driven development process for robotic systems.\nThe process consists of a robotics metamodel with first explications of\nnon-functional properties. A model-driven toolchain based on Eclipse provides\nthe model transformation and code generation steps. It also provides design\ntime analysis of resource parameters (e.g. schedulability analysis of realtime\ntasks) as a first step towards overall resource awareness in the development of\nintegrated robotic systems. The overall approach is underpinned by several real\nworld scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 16:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-27"}

With an angular resolution of 22'', ^{12}CO 3-2 emission was\ndetected in 114 targets. Based on 61 galaxies observed with equal beam sizes\nthe ^{12}CO 3-2/1-0 integrated line intensity ratio R_{31} is found to vary\nfrom 0.2 to 1.9, with an average value of 0.81. No correlations are found for\nR_{31} to Hubble type and far infrared luminosity. Possible indications for a\ncorrelation with inclination angle and the 60mum/100mum color temperature of\nthe dust are not significant. Higher R_{31} ratios than in ``normal'' galaxies,\nhinting at enhanced molecular excitation, may be found in galaxies hosting\nactive galactic nuclei. Even higher average values are determined for galaxies\nwith bars or starbursts, the latter being identified by the ratio of infrared\nluminosity versus isophotal area, log[(L_{FIR}/L_{SUN})/(D_{25}/kpc)^2)] >\n7.25. (U)LIRGs are found to have the highest averaged R_{31} value. This may be\na consequence of particularly vigorous star formation activity, triggered by\ngalaxy interaction and merger events. The nuclear CO luminosities are slightly\nsublinearly correlated with the global FIR luminosity in both the ^{12}CO J =\n3-2 and the 1-0 lines. The slope of the log-log plots rises with compactness of\nthe respective galaxy subsample, indicating a higher average density and a\nlarger fraction of thermalized gas in distant luminous galaxies. While linear\nor sublinear correlations for the ^{12}CO J = 3-2 line can be explained, if the\nbulk of the observed J = 3-2 emission originates from molecular gas with\ndensities below the critical one, the case of the ^{12}CO J = 1-0 line with its\nsmall critical density remains a puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 18:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

These resonances occur when the ratio of polar and radial orbital\nfrequencies, which is slowly evolving under the influence of gravitational\nradiation reaction, passes through a low order rational number. At such points,\nthe adiabatic approximation to the orbital evolution breaks down, and there is\na brief but order unity correction to the inspiral rate. Corrections to the\ngravitational wave signal's phase due to resonance effects scale as the square\nroot of the inverse of mass of the small body, and thus become large in the\nextreme-mass-ratio limit, dominating over all other post-adiabatic effects. The\nresonances make orbits more sensitive to changes in initial data (though not\nquite chaotic), and are genuine non-perturbative effects that are not seen at\nany order in a standard post-Newtonian expansion. Our results apply to an\nimportant potential source of gravitational waves, the gradual inspiral of\nwhite dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes into much more massive black holes.\nIt is hoped to exploit observations of these sources to map the spacetime\ngeometry of black holes. However, such mapping will require accurate models of\nbinary dynamics, which is a computational challenge whose difficulty is\nsignificantly increased by resonance effects.

On the\nbasis of the optical [OIII], mid-IR [OIV] and 6um AGN continuum luminosities we\nconservatively find that the X-ray emission in at least 6/14 (>43%) of our\nsample appear to be obscured by CT material with N_H>1.5x10^24cm^-2. Under the\nreasonable assumption that our 14 AGNs are representative of the overall X-ray\nundetected AGN population in the SDSS-XMM parent sample, we find that >20% of\nthe optical Type-2 AGN population are likely to be obscured by CT material.\nThis implies a space-density of log(Phi) >-4.9Mpc^-3 for CT AGNs with\nL_X>10^42erg/s at z~0.1, which we suggest may be consistent with that predicted\nby X-ray background synthesis models. Furthermore, using the 6um continuum\nluminosity to infer the intrinsic AGN luminosity and the stellar velocity\ndispersion to estimate M_BH, we find that the most conservatively identified CT\nAGNs in this sample may harbour some of the most rapidly growing black holes\n(median M_BH~3x10^7M_o) in the nearby Universe, with a median Eddington ratio\nof ~0.2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Multiple planets inside the hole can\ntorque the gas to high radial speeds over large distances, reducing the local\nsurface density while maintaining accretion. Thus multi-planet systems,\ntogether with reductions in disk opacity due to grain growth, can explain how\nholes can be simultaneously transparent and accreting. There remains the\nproblem of how outer disk gas diffuses into the hole. Here it has been proposed\nthat the magnetorotational instability (MRI) erodes disk surface layers ionized\nby stellar X-rays. In contrast to previous work, we find that the extent to\nwhich surface layers are MRI-active is limited not by ohmic dissipation but by\nambipolar diffusion, the latter measured by Am: the number of times a neutral\nhydrogen molecule collides with ions in a dynamical time. Simulations by Hawley\n& Stone showed that Am ~ 100 is necessary for ions to drive MRI turbulence in\nneutral gas. We calculate that in X-ray-irradiated surface layers, Am typically\nvaries from ~0.001 to 1, depending on the abundance of charge-adsorbing\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, whose properties we infer from Spitzer\nobservations. We conclude that ionization of H_2 by X-rays and cosmic rays can\nsustain, at most, only weak MRI turbulence in surface layers 1 to 10 g/cm^2\nthick, and that accretion rates in such layers are too small compared to\nobserved accretion rates for the majority of disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2010 02:46:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 19:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Our study serves as\na prelude to our analysis of the circular binary WDNS problem. We focus on\ncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold\ndegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such\nsystems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic\nWDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time\nscales and length scales involved. For this reason, we construct an equation of\nstate (EOS) which captures the main physical features of NSs while, at the same\ntime, scales down the size of WDs. We call these scaled-down WD models\n\"pseudo-WDs (pWDs)\". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of\nsimulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic\ncase. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS\nmass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed. The other set studies\nthe effect of the pWD compaction on the final outcome, when the pWD mass and\nthe NS are kept fixed. All simulations show that 14%-18% of the initial total\nrest mass escapes to infinity. All remnant masses still exceed the maximum rest\nmass that our cold EOS can support (1.92 solar masses), but no case leads to\nprompt collapse to a black hole. This outcome arises because the final\nconfigurations are hot. All cases settle into spherical, quasiequilibrium\nconfigurations consisting of a cold NS core surrounded by a hot mantle,\nresembling Thorne-Zytkow objects. Extrapolating our results to realistic WD\ncompactions, we predict that the likely outcome of a head-on collision of a\nrealistic, massive WDNS system will be the formation of a quasiequilibrium\nThorne-Zytkow-like object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 19:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

We examine\nthis possibility using SPH/N-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers in\nwhich the merged BH receives a recoil kick. This enables us to follow recoiling\nBHs in self-consistent, evolving merger remnants. In contrast to recent studies\non similar topics, we conduct a large parameter study, generating a suite of\nover 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models and a range of recoil\nvelocities (vk). Our main results are as follows. (1) BHs kicked at nearly the\ncentral escape speed (vesc) may oscillate on large orbits for up to a Hubble\ntime, but in gas-rich mergers, BHs kicked with up to ~ 0.7 vesc may be confined\nto the central few kpc of the galaxy, owing to gas drag and steep central\npotentials. (2) vesc in gas-rich mergers may increase rapidly during final\ncoalescence, in which case trajectories may depend on the timing of the BH\nmerger relative to the formation of the potential well. (3) Recoil events\ngenerally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei (AGN), but may\nactually extend AGN lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4) Kinematically-offset\nAGN (v > 800 km s^-1) may be observable for up to ~ 10 Myr either immediately\nafter the recoil or during pericentric passages through a gas-rich remnant. (5)\nSpatially-offset AGN (R > 1 kpc) generally have low luminosities and lifetimes\nof ~ 1 - 100 Myr. (6) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to ~ 5 times less massive\nthan their stationary counterparts. This lowers the normalization of the\nM-sigma relation and contributes to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (7)\nFinally, the displacement of AGN feedback after a recoil event enhances central\nstar formation rates, thereby extending the starburst phase of the merger and\ncreating a denser stellar cusp.

In supply-demand space, the solutions on a link consist of an\ninterior state and a stationary state, subject to admissible conditions such\nthat there are no positive and negative kinematic waves on the upstream and\ndownstream links respectively.

Our sample is comprised of stars in the field\nand some Galactic globular clusters, including stars on the main sequence, the\nred giant branch (RGB), and the horizontal branch (HB). The metal--poor stars\nare, mainly, slow rotators, and their Vsini distribution along the HR diagram\nis quite homogeneous. Nevertheless, a few moderate to high values of Vsini are\nfound in stars located on the main sequence and on the HB. We show that the\noverall distribution of Vsini values is basically independent of metallicity\nfor the stars in our sample. In particular, the fast-rotating main sequence\nstars in our sample present similar rotation rates as their metal-rich\ncounterparts, suggesting that some of them may actually be fairly young, in\nspite of their low metallicity, or else that at least some of them would be\nbetter classified as blue straggler stars.

Spiral density wave launched by the planet shocks and the\nangular momentum carried by the wave is transferred to the background flow. The\nexchange of the angular momentum can affect the mass flux in the vicinity of\nthe planet to form an underdense region, or gap, around the planetary orbit. We\nfirst perform weakly non-linear analyses to show that the specific vorticity\nformed by shock dissipation of density wave can be a source of mass flux in the\nvicinity of the planet, and that the gap can be opened even for low-mass\nplanets unless the migration of the planet is substantial. We then perform high\nresolution numerical simulations to check analytic consideration. By comparing\nthe gap opening timescale and type I migration timescale, we propose a\ncriterion for the formation of underdense region around the planetary orbit\nthat is qualitatively different from previous studies. The minimum mass\nrequired for the planet to form a dip is twice as small as previous studies if\nwe incorporate the standard values of type I migration timescale, but it can be\nmuch smaller if there is a location in the disk where type I migration is\nhalted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2010 01:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In\nmany applications, it is desirable to extract knowledge from trained neural\nnetworks so that the users can gain a better understanding of the solution.\nThis paper presents an efficient algorithm to extract rules from artificial\nneural networks. We use two-phase training algorithm for backpropagation\nlearning. In the first phase, the number of hidden nodes of the network is\ndetermined automatically in a constructive fashion by adding nodes one after\nanother based on the performance of the network on training data. In the second\nphase, the number of relevant input units of the network is determined using\npruning algorithm. The pruning process attempts to eliminate as many\nconnections as possible from the network. Relevant and irrelevant attributes of\nthe data are distinguished during the training process. Those that are relevant\nwill be kept and others will be automatically discarded.

For that reason, we developed the extensible Robotics\nAPI for programming industrial robots on top of a general-purpose language.\nAlthough being a very flexible approach to programming industrial robots, a\nfully-fledged language can be too complex for simple tasks. Additionally,\nlegacy support for code written in the original DSL has to be maintained. For\nthese reasons, we present a lightweight implementation of a typical robotic\nDSL, the KUKA Robot Language (KRL), on top of our Robotics API. This work deals\nwith the challenges in reverse-engineering the language and mapping its\nspecifics to the Robotics API. We introduce two different approaches of\ninterpreting and executing KRL programs: tree-based and bytecode-based\ninterpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2010 11:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}
