The sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies\n(ULIRGs), with LFIR larger than 2.8 10^{12} Lsol, experiencing starbursts;\nadopting a low ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their gas consumption\ntime-scale is lower than 10^8 yr. To date only very few CO observations exist\nin this redshift range that spans nearly 25% of the universe's age.\nConsiderable evolution of the star formation rate is already observed during\nthis period. 18 galaxies out of our sample of 30 are detected (of which 16 are\nnew detections), corresponding to a detection rate of 60%. The average CO\nluminosity for the 18 galaxies detected is L'CO = 2 10^{10} K km/s pc^2,\ncorresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.6 10^{10} Msol. The FIR luminosity\ncorrelates well with the CO luminosity, in agreement with the correlation found\nfor low and high redshift ULIRGs. Although the conversion factor between CO\nluminosity and H2 mass is uncertain, we find that the maximum amount of gas\navailable for a single galaxy is quickly increasing as a function of redshift.\nUsing the same conversion factor, the SFEs for z\\sim 0.2-0.6 ULIRGs are found\nto be significantly higher, by a factor 3, than for local ULIRGs, and are\ncomparable to high redshift ones. We compare this evolution to the expected\ncosmic H2 abundance and the cosmic star formation history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 16:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2011 22:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These binaries\nefficiently heat the cluster, reversing any incipient core contraction and\ndriving a subsequent phase of global expansion. Most previous theoretical\nstudies demonstrating deep and persistent dynamical relaxation have either\nconflated the process with mass segregation, ignored three-body interactions,\nor else adopted the artificial assumption that all cluster members are single\nstars of identical mass. In such a uniform-mass cluster, binary formation is\ngreatly delayed, as we confirm here both numerically and analytically. The\nrelative duration of core contraction and global expansion is effected by\nstellar evolution, which causes the most massive stars to die out before they\nform binaries. In clusters of higher N, the epoch of dynamical relaxation lasts\nfor progressively longer periods.

The approach works as follows: first, determine a\nconic formulation of the problem; second, determine its dual; third, apply\nsmoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal first-order method. A merit of\nthis approach is its flexibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems\ncan be solved via this approach. These include models with objective\nfunctionals such as the total-variation norm, ||Wx||_1 where W is arbitrary, or\na combination thereof. In addition, the paper also introduces a number of\ntechnical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme, a novel approach\nfor controlling the step size, and some new results showing that the smooth and\nunsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our\nframework, these lead to novel, stable and computationally efficient\nalgorithms.

In these systems, a net ratchet current can appear even in the\nabsence of time dependent perturbations, external tilting forces, or a bias in\nthe noise. The majority of studies on the interaction of L\\'evy noise with\nexternal potentials have assumed $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy statistics in the\nLangevin description, which in the continuum limit corresponds to the\nfractional Fokker-Planck equation. However, the divergence of the low order\nmoments is a potential drawback of $\\alpha$-stable distributions because, in\napplications, the moments represent physical quantities. For example, for\n$\\alpha <1$, the current $J$, in $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy ratchets is unbounded.\nTo overcome this limitation, we study ratchet transport using truncated L\\'evy\ndistributions which in the continuum limit correspond to the spatially tempered\nfractional Fokker-Planck equation. The main object of study is the dependence\nof the ratchet current on the level of tempering, $\\lambda$. For $\\lambda \\neq\n0$, the statistics ultimately converges (although very slowly) to Gaussian\ndiffusion in the absence of a potential. However, it is shown here that in the\npresence of a ratchet potential a finite current persists asymptotically for\nany finite value of $\\lambda$. The current converges exponentially in time to\nthe steady state value. The steady state current exhibits algebraically decay,\n$J\\sim \\lambda^{-\\zeta}$, for $\\alpha \\geq 1.75$. However, for $\\alpha \\leq\n1.5$, the decay is exponential, $J \\sim e^{-\\xi \\lambda}$. In the presence of a\nbias in the L\\'evy noise, it is shown that the tempering can lead to a current\nreversal.

We write the most general Lagrangian that couples the scalar\nmode associated to the breaking of time translation during inflation to the\nadditional light scalar fields.

By\nRashba-like systems we refer to the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupled\nphases; spin-split systems have spin-up and spin-down Fermi surfaces shifted\nrelative to each other. Both systems break parity but preserve time-reversal\nsymmetry. They belong to a class of symmetry-breaking ground states that\nsatisfy: (i) electron crystal momentum is a good quantum number (ii) these\nstates have no net magnetic moment and (iii) their distribution of `polarized\nspin' in momentum space breaks the lattice symmetry. In this class, the\nrelevant Coulomb matrix elements are found to be nearest-neighbor exchange $J$,\npair-hopping $J'$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$. These ground states lower\ntheir energy most effectively through $J$, hence we name them Class $J$ states.\nThe competing effects of $V-J'$ on the direct and exchange energies determine\nthe relative stability of Class $J$ states. We show that the spin-split and\nRashba-like phases are the most favored ground states within Class $J$ because\nthey have the minimum anisotropy in `polarized spin'. On a square lattice we\nfind that the spin-split phase is always favored for near-empty bands; above a\ncritical filling, we predict a transition from the paramagnetic to the\nRashba-like phase at $ J_{c1}$ and a second transition to the spin-split state\nat $J_{c2}>J_{c1}$. An energetic comparison with ferromagnetism highlights the\nimportance of the role of $V$ in the stability of Class $J$ states.

In this Teff\nrange planet hosting stars have lower Li abundances (by ~0.26 dex on average)\nthan the comparison stars, although this segregation may be influenced by\ncombining stars from a range of ages, metallicities and masses. When stars with\nvery restricted ranges in metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.00 to +0.20 dex) and mass (M\n~ 1.05 - 1.15 Msun are compared, however, both stars with and without planets\nexhibit similar behaviors in the lithium abundance with stellar age, suggesting\nthat there are no differences in the lithium abundances between stars with\nplanets and stars not known to have planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2010 01:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-04"}

Here we argue that the latter case is\nplausible and, for many L dwarfs, the more likely one. Furthermore evolutionary\nmodels of mature field L dwarfs predict surface gravities ranging from about\n200 to 2500 m/s^2 (corresponding to masses of about 15 to 70 times of Jupiter\nmass). Yet comparison of observed spectra to available synthetic spectra often\ndoes not permit more precise determination of the surface gravity of individual\nfield L dwarfs, leading to important uncertainties in their properties. Since\nrotationally-induced non-sphericity, which gives rise to non-zero\ndisk-integrated polarization, is more pronounced at lower gravities,\npolarization is a promising low gravity indicator. Here we combine a rigorous\nmultiple scattering analysis with a self-consistent cloudy atmospheric model\nand observationally inferred rotational velocities and find that the observed\noptical polarization can be explained if the surface gravity of the polarized\nobjects is about 300 m/s^2 or less, potentially providing a new method for\nconstraining L dwarf masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2010 07:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Based on the scenario of assisted dark energy, in which one\nscalar field is subdominant compared with the other in the early epoch, we show\nthat the entropy perturbations in this two-field system tend to be constant on\nlarge scales in the early epoch and hence survive until the present era for a\ngeneric evolution of both fields during the radiation and matter eras. This\nbehaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are\ncoupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the\nsubdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy\nperturbations can significantly influence the dynamics of density perturbations\nin the universe. Assuming correlations between the entropy and curvature\nperturbations, the entropy perturbations can enhance the integrated Sachs-Wolfe\n(ISW) effect if the signs of the contributions from entropy perturbations and\ncurvature perturbations are opposite after the matter era, otherwise the ISW\ncontribution is suppressed. For canonical scalar field the effect of entropy\nperturbations on ISW effect is small because the initial value of the entropy\nperturbations estimated during inflation cannot be sufficiently large.

Income is calculated by a Cobb-Douglas type\nproduction function, and selection of strategies for imitation depends on the\nincome growth rate they generate. We show that under these conditions, when an\nagent adopts a new strategy, the effect on its income growth rate is\nimmediately visible to other agents, which allows a group of imitating agents\nto quickly adapt their strategies when needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 23:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-15"}
