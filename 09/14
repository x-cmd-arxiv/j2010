With a large set of N-body simulations we show\nthat the improved formula for the Coulomb logarithm fits the orbital decay very\nwell for circular and eccentric orbits. The local scale-length of the\nbackground density distribution serves as the maximum impact parameter for a\nwide range of power-law indices of -1 ... -5. For each type of code the\nnumerical resolution must be compared to the effective minimum impact parameter\nin order to determine the Coulomb logarithm. We also quantify the correction\nfactors by using self-consistent velocity distribution functions instead of the\nstandard Maxwellian often used. These factors enter directly the decay\ntimescale and cover a range of 0.5 ... 3 for typical orbits. The new Coulomb\nlogarithm combined with self-consistent velocity distribution functions in the\nChandrasekhar formula provides a significant improvement of orbital decay times\nwith correction up to one order of magnitude compared to the standard case.

In black holes this\noscillatory behavior is preserved and easily discerned at much longer lags\nwhile this is not the case for the neutron star system Cyg X-2. The ACF of GRS\n1915+105 provides an exception to this general behavior in that its decay is\nlinear in time indicating an undamped oscillation of coherent phase.

Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima.

For weak magnetic fields, dilute plasmas are buoyantly unstable\nfor either sign of the temperature gradient: the heat-flux-driven buoyancy\ninstability (HBI) operates when the temperature increases with radius while the\nmagnetothermal instability (MTI) operates in the opposite limit. In contrast to\nprevious results, we show that, in the presence of a sustained temperature\ngradient, the MTI drives strong turbulence and operates as an efficient\nmagnetic dynamo (akin to standard, adiabatic convection). Together, the\nturbulent and magnetic energies contribute up to ~10% of the pressure support\nin the plasma. In addition, the MTI drives a large convective heat flux, ~1.5%\nof rho c_s^3. These findings are robust even in the presence of an external\nsource of strong turbulence. Our results on the nonlinear saturation of the HBI\nare consistent with previous studies but we explain physically why the HBI\nsaturates quiescently by re-orienting the magnetic field (suppressing the\nconductive heat flux through the plasma), while the MTI saturates by generating\nsustained turbulence. We also systematically study how an external source of\nturbulence affects the saturation of the HBI: such turbulence can disrupt the\nHBI only on scales where the shearing rate of the turbulence is faster than the\ngrowth rate of the HBI. In particular, our results provide a simple mapping\nbetween the level of turbulence in a plasma and the effective isotropic thermal\nconductivity.

Using a set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate the\nefficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism. We explore a wide variety of dwarf\norbital configurations and initial structures and demonstrate that in most\ncases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellar\ncomponents undergo a dramatic morphological and dynamical transformation: from\ndisks to bars and finally to pressure-supported spheroidal systems with\nkinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the\nLocal Group (LG). Our results suggest that such tidal transformations should be\ncommon occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm and\nhighlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be the\nstrength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. We demonstrate\nthat the combination of short orbital times and small pericenters,\ncharacteristic of dwarfs being accreted at high redshift, induces the strongest\ntransformations. Our models also indicate that the transformation efficiency is\naffected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. Lastly,\nwe find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation Vmax = \\sqrt{3} * sigma,\nwhere sigma is the 1D, central stellar velocity dispersion and Vmax is the\nmaximum halo circular velocity, with intriguing implications for the missing\nsatellites problem.

We also find that the 56Ni dependence\non total mass and mass ratio is not linear, with larger mass primaries\nproducing disproportionately more 56Ni than their lower mass secondary\ncounterparts, and symmetric pairs of masses producing more 56Ni than asymmetric\npairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 20:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Here we use a quantitative analysis of the rapid optical brightness\nvariations from this companion, Mira B, which we observed with the Nickel\ntelescope at Lick Observatory, to show that it is a white dwarf (WD). The\namplitude of aperiodic optical variations on time scales of minutes to tens of\nminutes (approximately 0.2 mag) is consistent with that of accreting WDs in\ncataclysmic variables on these same time scales. It is significantly greater\nthan that expected from an accreting main-sequence star. With Mira B identified\nas a WD, its ultraviolet (UV) and optical luminosities, along with constraints\non the WD effective temperature from the UV, indicate that it accretes at\n~1e-10 solar masses per year. We do not find any evidence that the accretion\nrate is higher than predicted by Bondi-Hoyle theory. The accretion rate is high\nenough, however, to explain the weak X-ray emission, since the accretion-disk\nboundary layer around a low-mass WD accreting at this rate is likely to be\noptically thick and therefore to emit primarily in the far or extreme UV.\nFurthermore, the finding that Mira B is a WD means that it has experienced, and\nwill continue to experience nova explosions, roughly every million years. It\nalso highlights the similarity between Mira AB and other jet-producing\nsymbiotic binaries such as R Aquarii, CH Cygni, and MWC 560, and therefore\nraises the possibility that Mira B launched the recently discovered bipolar\nstreams from this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 20:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These relations are a\ncharacteristic property of unified flavour models and can reduce the large\nnumber of free parameters related to the flavour sector of the SM. The Yukawa\ncouplings of the down-type quarks and charged leptons are affected within SUSY\nmodels by tan beta-enhanced threshold corrections. We analyse these corrections\nand give simple analytic expressions and numerical estimates for them. The\nthreshold corrections sensitively depend on the soft SUSY breaking parameters.\nEspecially, they determine if the affected Yukawa couplings are enhanced or\nsuppressed. In a first approach, we make some plausible assumptions about the\nsoft SUSY parameters. In a second, more sophisticated approach we use three\ncommon breaking schemes in which all the soft breaking parameters at the\nelectroweak scale can be calculated from only a handful of parameters. Within\nthis approach, we apply various phenomenological constraints on the\nsupersymmetric parameters and find in this way new viable Yukawa coupling\nrelations, for example y_mu/y_s = 9/2 or 6 or y_tau/y_b = 3/2 in SU(5).\nFurthermore, we study a special class of quark mass matrix textures for small\ntan beta where theta_13^u = theta_13^d = 0.

We in this paper present the analytical results\nobtained recently for the general topology that show the correlation created by\nthe probes sent by multiple sources to a node located in an intersection of\nmultiple trees. The correlation is expressed by a set of polynomials of the\npass rates of the paths connecting the sources to the node.

Single particle quantities, such as the spectral function, the\nquasiparticle weight and the entropy, display a crossover between two distinct\nground states: a Fermi liquid at low filling and a non-Fermi liquid with a\npseudogap at high filling. Both states are found to cross over to a marginal\nFermi-liquid state at higher temperatures. For finite next-nearest-neighbor\nhopping t' we find a classical critical point at temperature T_c. This\nclassical critical point is found to be associated with a phase separation\ntransition between a compressible Mott gas and an incompressible Mott liquid\ncorresponding to the Fermi liquid and the pseudogap state, respectively. Since\nthe critical temperature T_c extrapolates to zero as t' vanishes, we conclude\nthat a quantum critical point connects the Fermi-liquid to the pseudogap\nregion, and that the marginal-Fermi-liquid behavior in its vicinity is the\nanalogous of the supercritical region in the liquid-gas transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 03:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Given that the W and Z gauge\nbosons decay dominantly via hadronic channels, it is thus impossible to produce\nfinal state leptons without accompanying protons, antiprotons, and gamma rays.\nSignificantly, while many dark matter models feature a helicity suppressed\nannihilation rate to fermions, radiating a massive gauge boson from a final\nstate fermion removes this helicity suppression, such that the branching ratios\nBr(l \\nu W), Br(l^+l^- Z), and Br(\\nu\\nubar Z) dominate over Br(l\\bar{l}).\nW/Z-bremsstrahlung thus allows indirect detection of many WIMP models that\nwould otherwise be helicity-suppressed, or v^2 suppressed.

Assuming that the quality of all user\nchannels is available to a central controller, a simple scheme which maximizes\nthe utility function defined as the sum logarithm throughput of all users has\nbeen shown to guarantee proportional fairness. However, to acquire the channel\nquality information may consume substantial amount of resources. In this work,\nit is assumed that probing the quality of each user's channel takes a fraction\nof the coherence time, so that the amount of time for data transmission is\nreduced. The multiuser diversity gain does not always increase as the number of\nusers increases. In case the statistics of the channel quality is available to\nthe controller, the problem of sequential channel probing for user scheduling\nis formulated as an optimal stopping time problem. A joint channel probing and\nproportional fair scheduling scheme is developed. This scheme is extended to\nthe case where the channel statistics are not available to the controller, in\nwhich case a joint learning, probing and scheduling scheme is designed by\nstudying a generalized bandit problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed scheduling schemes can provide significant gain over existing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 09:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-15"}

During this period, high-energy observations were performed by\nXMM-Newton, Swift, and Fermi. We analyse these data with particular attention\nto the calibration of Swift UV data, and apply a helical jet model to interpret\nthe source broad-band variability. The GASP-WEBT observations show an optical\nflare in 2008 February-March, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on a\nfew-day time scale afterwards. The radio flux is only mildly variable. The UV\ndata from both XMM-Newton and Swift seem to confirm a UV excess that is likely\ncaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. The X-ray data from\nXMM-Newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate flux\nvariability on an hour time scale. The Swift X-ray data reveal fast (interday)\nflux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. We compare\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightness\nstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburst\nstate, where the inverse-Compton emission was prevailing. A fit with an\ninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are at\nwork with their self inverse-Compton emission. Most likely, they represent the\nradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. We show that the\ndifference between the source SEDs in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in terms\nof pure geometrical variations. The outburst state occurred when the\njet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing an\nincrease of the Doppler beaming factor. Our analysis demonstrates that the jet\ngeometry can play an extremely important role in the BL Lacertae flux and\nspectral variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 09:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

While there are several\nworks that emphasize the effect of social influence in understanding fashion\ntrends, in this paper we show how boredom plays a strong role in both\nindividual and social choices. We show how boredom can be used to explain the\ncyclic choices in several scenarios such as an individual who has to pick a\nrestaurant to visit every day, or a society that has to repeatedly `vote' on a\nsingle fashion style from a collection. We formally show that a society that\nvotes for a single fashion style can be viewed as a single individual cycling\nthrough different choices.\n  In our model, the utility of an item gets discounted by the amount of boredom\nthat has accumulated over the past; this boredom increases with every use of\nthe item and decays exponentially when not used. We address the problem of\noptimally choosing items for usage, so as to maximize over-all satisfaction,\ni.e., composite utility, over a period of time. First we show that the simple\ngreedy heuristic of always choosing the item with the maximum current composite\nutility can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. Second, we prove that even\nwith just a single individual, determining the optimal strategy for choosing\nitems is NP-hard. Third, we show that a simple modification to the greedy\nalgorithm that simply doubles the boredom of each item is a provably close\napproximation to the optimal strategy.

The\ninverse of the metric tensor for these manifolds (i.e. the cometric), when\nwritten in coordinates, is such that each of its elements depends on at most 2D\nof the ND coordinates. This makes the matrices of partial derivatives of the\ncometric very sparse in nature, thus suggesting solving the highly non-trivial\nproblem of developing a formula that expresses sectional curvature in terms of\nthe cometric and its first and second partial derivatives (we call this Mario's\nformula). We apply such formula to the manifolds of landmarks and in particular\nwe fully explore the case of geodesics on which only two points have non-zero\nmomenta and compute the sectional curvatures of 2-planes spanned by the\ntangents to such geodesics.

Our model involves an\ninhomogeneous stochastic gossip process of continuous opinion dynamics in a\nsociety consisting of two types of agents: regular agents, who update their\nbeliefs according to information that they receive from their social neighbors;\nand stubborn agents, who never update their opinions. When the society contains\nstubborn agents with different opinions, the belief dynamics never lead to a\nconsensus (among the regular agents). Instead, beliefs in the society fail to\nconverge almost surely, the belief profile keeps on fluctuating in an ergodic\nfashion, and it converges in law to a non-degenerate random vector. The\nstructure of the network and the location of the stubborn agents within it\nshape the opinion dynamics. The expected belief vector evolves according to an\nordinary differential equation coinciding with the Kolmogorov backward equation\nof a continuous-time Markov chain with absorbing states corresponding to the\nstubborn agents and converges to a harmonic vector, with every regular agent's\nvalue being the weighted average of its neighbors' values, and boundary\nconditions corresponding to the stubborn agents'.

These\nions are at the basis of molecular deuterium fractionation, a common\ncharacteristic observed in star forming regions. H2D+ is now routinely\nobserved, but the search for its isotopologue D2H+ is still difficult because\nof the high frequency of its ground para transition (692 GHz). Aims: We have\nobserved molecular transitions of H2D+ and D2H+ in a cold prestellar core to\ncharacterize the roots of deuterium chemistry. Methods: Thanks to the sensitive\nmulti-pixel CHAMP+ receiver on the APEX telescope where the required excellent\nweather conditions are met, we not only successfully detect D2H+ in the H-MM1\nprestellar core located in the L1688 cloud, but also obtain information on the\nspatial extent of its emission. We also detect H2D+ at 372 GHz in the same\nsource. We analyse these detections using a non-LTE radiative transfer code and\na state-of-the-art spin-dependent chemical model. Results: This observation is\nthe first secure detection of D2H+ in space. The emission is moreover extended\nover several pixels of the CHAMP+ array, i.e. on a scale of at least 40'',\ncorresponding to ~ 4800 AU. We derive column densities on the order of\n1e12-1e13 cm-2 for both molecules in the LTE approximation depending on the\nassumed temperature, and up to two orders of magnitude higher based on a\nnon-LTE analysis. Conclusions: Our modeling suggests that the level of CO\ndepletion must be extremely high (>10, and even >100 if the temperature of the\ncore is around 10 K) at the core center, in contradiction with CO depletion\nlevels directly measured in other cores. Observation of the H2D+ spatial\ndistribution and direct measurement of the CO depletion in H-MM1 will be\nessential to confirm if present chemical models investigating the basis of\ndeuterium [...].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 14:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, in BHBs this QPO has a centroid\nfrequency which scales tightly with the position of the low-frequency break in\nthe broad band power spectrum. We use this relation to predict the frequency of\nthe power spectral break in NGC 5408 X-1, and show that this is inconsistent\nwith the break frequencies in both available, archival XMM-Newton observations.\nThus the broad band power spectral shape does not support this identification\nof the QPO. The energy spectra also do not support an IMBH interpretation. They\ncan be fit by a two-component model, best described by soft thermal emission at\nlow energies, together with low-temperature, optically thick Comptonisation\nproducing a tail which dominates above 2 keV. The parameters of the tail are\nunlike those seen in any of the sub-Eddington BHB spectral states. The energy\ndependent variability supports this deconvolution, as it is consistent with the\nsoft thermal component below 2 keV diluting extreme variability of the high\nenergy tail. The only objects with similar spectra which have similar amounts\nof variability are the BHB, GRS 1915+105, and some extreme NLS1s. This suggests\nthat NGC 5408 X-1 is in a similar super-Eddington state, placing a natural\nlimit on the mass of < 100 solar masses. Its QPO could then be similar to the\nultra-LFQPO seen occasionally in GRS 1915+105, consistent with a large stellar\nmass black hole.

There is now evidence for grain growth in\nseveral disks around young stars. Radially resolved images of grain growth in\ncircumstellar disks are believed to be a powerful tool to constrain the dust\nevolution models and the initial stage for the formation of planets. In this\npaper we attempt to provide these constraints for the disk surrounding the\nyoung star CQ Tau. This system was already suggested from previous studies to\nhost a population of grains grown to large sizes. We present new high angular\nresolution (0.3-0.9 arcsec) observations at wavelengths from 850um to 3.6cm\nobtained at the SMA, IRAM-PdBI and NRAO-VLA interferometers. We perform a\ncombined analysis of the spectral energy distribution and of the\nhigh-resolution images at different wavelengths using a model to describe the\ndust thermal emission from the circumstellar disk. We include a prescription\nfor the gas emission from the inner regions of the system. We detect the\npresence of evolved dust by constraining the disk averaged dust opacity\ncoefficient beta (computed between 1.3 and 7mm) to be 0.6+/-0.1. This confirms\nthe earlier suggestions that the disk contains dust grains grown to significant\nsizes and puts this on firmer grounds by tightly constraining the gas\ncontamination to the observed fluxes at mm-cm wavelengths. We report some\nevidence of radial variations in dust properties, but current resolution and\nsensitivity are still too low for definitive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 15:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
