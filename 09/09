While it has been proposed that these may be\nvariously intrinsic or extrinsic in nature, we are able to rule out the former\nmechanism. We do this by means of very large scale, three dimensional atomistic\nsimulations using the quantum mechanical bond order potential. We find that the\nkink-pair formation energy is large: 6eV, while the single kink migration\nenergy is conversely very small: 0.13eV. Using these, and other atomistically\nderived data, we make kinetic Monte Carlo simulations at realistic time and\nlength scales to simulate dislocation mobility as a function of stress and\ntemperature. In the temperature range of the stress anomaly in gamma-TiAl, we\ndetermine whether one or several of the pinning and unzipping processes\nassociated with generation of jogs are observed during our simulations. We\nconclude that the pinning of ordinary dislocations and anomalous mechanical\nbehaviour in gamma-TiAl must be attributed to a combination of extrinsic\nobstacles and extensive cross-slip in a crystal containing impurities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 16:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 11:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 08:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 12:27:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 08:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

Our\ngoal is to investigate the C-N anti-correlation with low-resolution\nspectroscopy of 20-50 stars fainter than the first dredge-up in seven globular\nclusters (NGC288, NGC1851, NGC5927, NGC6352, NGC6388, and Pal12) with different\nproperties. We complemented our observations with 47~Tuc archival data, with\nfour additional clusters from the literature (M15, M22, M55, NGC362), and with\nadditional literature data on NGC288. In this first paper, we measured the\nstrength of CN and CH band indices, and we investigated the anti-correlation\nand bimodality of these indices. We compared r_CN, the ratio of stars belonging\nto the CN-strong and weak groups, with 15 different cluster parameters. We\nclearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the CH and CN band stregths in the\nmetal-rich clusters (Pal12, 47Tuc, NGC6352, NGC5927). Only M15 among the\nmetal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal anti-correlation. We found weak\ncorrelations (sligthly above 1 sigma) of r_CN with the cluster orbital\nparameters, present-day total mass, cluster concentration, and age. Our\nfindings support the self-enrichment scenario, and suggest that the occurrence\nof more than two major generations of stars in a GGC should be rare. Small\nadditional generations (<10-20% of the total) would be difficult to detect with\nour samples.

We introduce a new self-directed capillary densification method\nwhere a liquid is controllably condensed onto and evaporated from CNT forests.\nCompared to prior approaches, where the substrate with CNTs is immersed in a\nliquid, our condensation approach gives significantly more uniform structures\nand enables precise control of the CNT packing density and pillar\ncross-sectional shape. We present a set of design rules and parametric studies\nof CNT micropillar densification by this method, and show that self-directed\ncapillary densification enhances the Young's modulus and electrical\nconductivity of CNT micropillars by more than three orders of magnitude. Owing\nto the outstanding properties of CNTs, this scalable process will be useful for\nthe integration of CNTs as functional material in microfabricated devices for\nmechanical, electrical, thermal, and biomedical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 17:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In the search for quantum gravity,\nresearch in phenomenology has been dominated by models violating Lorentz\ninvariance (LI) -- despite there being, at present, no evidence that LI is\nviolated. Causal set theory is a LI candidate theory of QG that seeks not to\nquantise gravity as such, but rather to develop a new understanding of the\nuniverse from which both GR and QM could arise separately. The key hypothesis\nis that spacetime is a discrete partial order: a set of events where the\npartial ordering is the physical causal ordering between the events. This\nthesis investigates Lorentz invariant QG phenomenology motivated by the causal\nset approach. Massive particles propagating in a discrete spacetime will\nexperience diffusion in both position and momentum in proper time. This thesis\nconsiders this idea in more depth, providing a rigorous derivation of the\ndiffusion equation in terms of observable cosmic time. The diffusion behaviour\ndoes not depend on any particular underlying particle model. Simulations of\nthree different models are conducted, revealing behaviour that matches the\ndiffusion equation despite limitations on the size of causal set simulated. The\neffect of spacetime discreteness on the behaviour of massless particles is also\ninvestigated. Diffusion equations in both affine time and cosmic time are\nderived, and it is found that massless particles undergo diffusion and drift in\nenergy. Constraints are placed on the magnitudes of the drift and diffusion\nparameters by considering the blackbody nature of the CMB. Spacetime\ndiscreteness also has a potentially observable effect on photon polarisation.\nFor linearly polarised photons, underlying discreteness is found to cause a\nrotation in polarisation angle and a suppression in overall polarisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 17:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

Our goal is to investigate with infrared interferometry the structure\nof IRS 9A on scales as small as 200AU, exploiting the fact that a cluster of O\nand B stars has blown away much of the obscuring foreground dust and gas.\nObservations in the N-band were carried out with the MIDI beam combiner\nattached to the VLTI. Additional interferometric observations which probe the\nstructure of IRS 9A on larger scales were performed with an aperture mask\ninstalled in the T-ReCS instrument of Gemini South. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) is constrained by the MIDI N-band spectrum and by data from\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope. Our efforts to model the structure and SED of IRS\n9A range from simple geometrical models of the brightness distribution to one-\nand two-dimensional radiative transfer computations. The target is resolved by\nT-ReCS, with an equivalent (elliptical) Gaussian width of 330mas by 280mas\n(2300 AU by 2000 AU). Despite this fact, a warm compact unresolved component\nwas detected by MIDI which is possibly associated with the inner regions of a\nflattened dust distribution. Based on our interferometric data, no sign of\nmultiplicity was found on scales between about 200AU and 700AU projected\nseparation. A geometric model consisting of a warm (1000 K) ring (400 AU\ndiameter) and a cool (140 K) large envelope provides a good fit to the data. No\nsingle model fitting all visibility and photometric data could be found, with\ndisk models performing better than spherical models. While the data are clearly\ninconsistent with a spherical dust distribution they are insufficient to prove\nthe existence of a disk but rather hint at a more complex dust distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 17:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

While some WSN applications only require a lim- ited\namount of bandwidth, new emerging applications operate with a notice- ably\nlarge amount of data transfers. One way to deal with such applications is to\nmaximize the available capacity by utilizing the use of multiple wireless\nchannels. This work proposes DynaChannAl, a distributed dynamic wireless\nchannel algorithm with the goal of effectively distributing nodes on multiple\nwireless channels in WSN systems. Specifically, DynaChannAl targets applica-\ntions where mobile nodes connect to a pre-existing wireless backbone and takes\nthe expected end-to-end queuing delay as its core metric. We use the link qual-\nity indicator (LQI) values provided by IEEE 802.15.4 radios white-list\npotential links with good link quality and evaluate such links with the\naggregated packet transmission latency at each hop. Our approach is useful for\napplications that require minimal end-to-end delay (i.e., healthcare\napplications). DynaChannAl is a light weight and highly adoptable scheme that\ncan be easily incorporated with various pre-developed components and\npre-deployed applications. We eval- uate DynaChannAl in on a 45 node WSN\ntestbed. As the first study to consider end-to-end latency as the core metric\nfor channel allocation in WSN systems, the experimental results indicate that\nDynaChannAl successfully distributes multi- ple (mobile) source nodes on\ndifferent wireless channels and enables the nodes to select wireless channel\nand links that can minimize the end-to-end latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 18:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

RADAMESH uses a novel Monte Carlo approach to sample the radiation\nfield within the computational domain on a \"cell-by-cell\" basis. Thanks to this\nalgorithm, the computational efforts are now focused where actually needed,\ni.e. within the Ionization-fronts (I-fronts). This results in an increased\naccuracy level and, at the same time, a huge gain in computational speed with\nrespect to a \"classical\" Monte Carlo RT, especially when combined with an\nAdaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) scheme. Among several new features, RADAMESH is\nable to adaptively refine the computational mesh in correspondence of the\nI-fronts, allowing to fully resolve them within large, cosmological boxes. We\nfollow the propagation of ionizing radiation from an arbitrary number of\nsources and from the recombination radiation produced by H and He. The chemical\nstate of six species (HI, HII, HeI, HeII, HeIII, e) and gas temperatures are\ncomputed with a time-dependent, non-equilibrium chemistry solver. We present\nseveral validating tests of the code, including the standard tests from the RT\nCode Comparison Project and a new set of tests aimed at substantiating the new\ncharacteristics of RADAMESH. Using our AMR scheme, we show that properly\nresolving the I-front of a bright quasar during Reionization produces a large\nincrease of the predicted gas temperature within the whole HII region. Also, we\ndiscuss how H and He recombination radiation is able to substantially change\nthe ionization state of both species (for the classical Stroemgren sphere test)\nwith respect to the widely used \"on-the-spot\" approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 20:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 19:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 14:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Its extension\nto quantum computers allows the relative power of quantum computers to be\nanalyzed.

Two colliding pairs of\ngalaxies, UGC12914/5 and UGC 813/6 deviate from this correlation and show an\nexcess of radio emission which in both cases originates to a large extent in a\ngas bridge connecting the two galactic disks. We are aiming to clarify the\norigin of the radio continuum emission from the bridge. The radio synchrotron\nemission expected from the bridge regions is calculated, assuming that the\nkinetic energy liberated in the predominantly gas dynamic interaction of the\nrespective interstellar media (ISM) has produced shock waves that efficiently\naccelerate nuclei and electrons to relativistic energies. We present a model\nfor this acceleration and calculate the resulting radio emission, its spectral\nindex and the expected high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is found that the\nnonthermal energy produced in the collision is large enough to explain the\nradio emission from the bridge between the two galaxies. The calculated\nspectral index at the present time also agrees with the observed value. The\ndeviation of these two interacting galaxy systems from the standard FIR-radio\ncorrelation is consistent with the acceleration of an additional population of\nelectrons. This process is not related to star formation and therefore it is\nexpected that the systems do not follow the FIR-radio correlation. The\nacceleration of relativistic electrons in shocks caused by an ISM collision, in\nthe same way as described here, is likely to take place in other systems as\nwell, as in galaxy clusters and groups or high-redshift systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 22:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We pose the question\nof whether physically universal CAs exist. Such CAs would provide a model of\nthe world where the boundary between a physical system and its controller can\nbe consistently shifted, in analogy to the Heisenberg cut for the quantum\nmeasurement problem. We propose to study the thermodynamic cost of computation\nand control within such a model because implementing a cyclic process on a\nmicrosystem may require a non-cyclic process for its controller, whereas\nimplementing a cyclic process on system and controller may require the\nimplementation of a non-cyclic process on a \"meta\"-controller, and so on.\nPhysically universal CAs avoid this infinite hierarchy of controllers and the\ncost of implementing cycles on a subsystem can be described by mixing\nproperties of the CA dynamics. We define a physical prior on the CA\nconfigurations by applying the dynamics to an initial state where half of the\nCA is in the maximum entropy state and half of it is in the all-zero state\n(thus reflecting the fact that life requires non-equilibrium states like the\nboundary between a hold and a cold reservoir). As opposed to Solomonoff's\nprior, our prior does not only account for the Kolmogorov complexity but also\nfor the cost of isolating the system during the state preparation if the\npreparation process is not robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 09:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-10"}

We then apply the construction to the semi-field of\npositive real numbers with max as addition, which plays a central role in\nidempotent analysis and tropical geometry. Our construction gives the inverse\nprocess of the ``dequantization\" and provides a first hint towards an extension\nof the field of real numbers relevant both in number theory and quantum\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 13:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-10"}

Aims: To obtain the bolometric fluxes and, using kinematic\ndistance information, the luminosities for young RMS sources with far-infrared\nfluxes. Methods: We use a model spectral energy distribution (SED) fitter to\nobtain the bolometric flux for our sources, given flux data from our work and\nthe literature. The inputs to the model fitter were optimised by a series of\ninvestigations designed to reveal the effect varying these inputs had on the\nresulting bolometric flux.

These theorems, which are in fact generalized Noether theorems, have\nseveral nontrivial ramifications. One immediate consequence is the necessity to\nre-evaluate some of the default characterizations of the original Noether\ntheorems as general statements - for instance, the statement that every global\ninvariance of the action gives rise to a conserved current. As it turns out,\nthis latter statement remains valid, but apparently only as a consequence of\nboth the generalized first and second Noether theorem (at any rate, it is very\nfar from clear how to avoid such a conclusion). A ramification of a more\nconstructive nature consists in a novel expression for the so-called Belinfante\nstress-energy tensor, for which it is evident that it generalizes to the\ncorrect stress-energy tensor within the context of general relativity. The\ncrucial symmetry property here is diffeomorphism invariance, rather than\nPoincar\\'e invariance.

The drop free fall height was varied\nto obtain a Weber number (We) between 10 and 2000. Results showed that obtained\ncrater morphologies highly depend on the impacting drop kinetic energy E_{K}.\nDifferent behaviours during the drop spreading, receding and absorption are\nhighlighted as function of the fluids viscosity and surface tension.\nExperimental absorption times are also commented and compared with a simplified\ntheoretical model. Drops maximal extensions and craters diameters were found to\nscale as $We^{1/5}$ and $E_K^{1/5}$ respectively. In both cases, found\ndependencies are smaller than those reported in literature: $We^{1/4}$ for drop\nimpacts on solid or granular surfaces and $E_K^{1/4}$ for spherical solid\nimpacts on granular media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 15:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}

We find a general improvement in the properties of semiconducting and\ninsulating systems, relative to calculations with standard generalized gradient\napproximations, although this is not always by the same mechanism as other\napproaches such as the quasiparticle GW method. In ZnO the valence bands are\nnarrowed and the band gap is increased to a value in much better agreement with\nexperiment. The Zn $d$ states do not move to higher binding energy as they do\nin LDA+U calculations. The functional is effective for systems with hydride\nanions, where correcting self-interaction errors in the 1$s$ state is\nimportant. Similarly, it correctly opens semiconducting gaps in the alkaline\nearth hexaborides.It correctly stabilizes an antiferromagnetic insulating\nground state for the undoped cuprate parent CaCuO$_2$, but seriously degrades\nthe agreement with experiment for ferromagnetic Gd relative to the standard\nlocal spin density approximation and generalized gradient approximations. This\nis due to positioning of the minority spin $4f$ states at too low an energy.\nConversly, the position of the La $4f$ conduction bands of La$_2$O$_3$ is in\nreasonable accord with experiment as it is with standard functionals. The\nfunctional narrows the Fe $d$ bands of the parent compound LaFeAsO of the iron\nhigh temperature superconductors, while maintaining the high Fe spectral weight\nnear the Fermi energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 15:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-08"}

Applying analytical arguments\nand numerical methods, we demonstrate that the presence of long waiting times\ndistributed according to a power-law distribution with a diverging mean leads\nto very general asymptotic properties of the survival probability. The observed\nsurvival probability asymptotically decays like a power-law whose form is not\naffected by the value of the exponent characterizing the power-law jump length\ndistribution. It is demonstrated that this behavior is typical of and generic\nfor systems exhibiting long waiting times.

These resources are often aggravated by many factors like the\ntemporal constraints for availability or node flooding by the requested\nreplicated file chunks. Thus replicated file chunks should be efficiently\ndisseminated in order to enable resource availability on-demand by the mobile\nusers. This work considers a cross layered middleware support system for\nefficient delay-sensitive streaming by using each device's connectivity and\nsocial interactions in a cross layered manner. The collaborative streaming is\nachieved through the epidemically replicated file chunk policy which uses a\ntransition-based approach of a chained model of an infectious disease with\nsusceptible, infected, recovered and death states. The Gossip-based stateful\nmodel enforces the mobile nodes whether to host a file chunk or not or, when no\nlonger a chunk is needed, to purge it.
