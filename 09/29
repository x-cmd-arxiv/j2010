On one hand, models involving elaborate radiative transfer\nsolvers are too time consuming in general to perform an automatic fitting\nprocedure and derive astrophysical quantities and their related errors. On the\nother hand, using simple geometrical models does not give sufficient insights\ninto the physics of the object. We propose to stand in between these two\nextreme approaches by using a physical but still simple parameterised model for\nthe object under consideration. Based on this philosophy, we developed a\nnumerical tool optimised for mid-infrared (mid-IR) interferometry, the fast\nray-tracing algorithm for circumstellar structures (FRACS) which can be used as\na stand-alone model, or as an aid for a more advanced physical description or\neven for elaborating observation strategies. FRACS is based on the ray-tracing\ntechnique without scattering, but supplemented with the use of quadtree meshes\nand the full symmetries of the axisymmetrical problem to significantly decrease\nthe necessary computing time to obtain e.g. monochromatic images and\nvisibilities. We applied FRACS in a theoretical study of the dusty\ncircumstellar environments (CSEs) of B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) in order to\ndetermine which information (physical parameters) can be retrieved from present\nmid-IR interferometry (flux and visibility). From a set of selected dusty CSE\nmodels typical of sgB[e] stars we show that together with the geometrical\nparameters (position angle, inclination, inner radius), the temperature\nstructure (inner dust temperature and gradient) can be well constrained by the\nmid-IR data alone. Our results also indicate that the determination of the\nparameters characterising the CSE density structure is more challenging but, in\nsome cases, upper limits as well as correlations on the parameters\ncharacterising the mass loss can be obtained. Good constraints for the sgB[e]\ncentral continuum emission (central star and inner gas emissions) can be\nobtained whenever its contribution to the total mid-IR flux is only as high as\na few percents. Ray-tracing parameterised models such as FRACS are thus well\nadapted to prepare and/or interpret long wavelengths (from mid-IR to radio)\nobservations at present (e.g. VLTI/MIDI) and near-future (e.g. VLTI/MATISSE,\nALMA) interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 16:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Deep in the photosphere, as sampled by the bisectors at the 80%-88%\nintensity levels, we always observe blueshifts or zero velocities. The maximum\nblueshifts reach 1.2 km/s and tend to be cospatial with bright penumbral\nfilaments. In the line core we detect blueshifts for the most part, with small\nvelocities not exceeding 300 m/s. Redshifts also occur, but at the level of\n100-150 m/s, and only occasionally. The fact that they are visible in high\nlayers casts doubts on their convective origin. Overall, we do not find\nindications of downflows that could be associated with overturning convection\nat our detection limit of 150 m/s. Either no downflows exist, or we have been\nunable to observe them because they occur beneath tau=1 or the spatial\nresolution/height resolution of the measurements is still insufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 18:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This paper builds on our earlier work\n[D. Blume and K. M.

The treatment is general, but\nthe application is to the circumstellar disks that arise during the\ngravitational collapse phase of star formation. We find the dispersion relation\nfor spiral density waves in these generalized disks and derive the stability\ncriterion for axisymmetric $(m=0)$ disturbances (the analog of the Toomre\nparameter $Q_T$) for any radial distribution of the mass-to-flux ratio\n$\\lambda$. The magnetic effects work in two opposing directions: on one hand,\nmagnetic tension and pressure stabilize the disk against gravitational collapse\nand fragmentation; on the other hand, they also lower the rotation rate making\nthe disk more unstable. For disks around young stars the first effect generally\ndominates, so that magnetic fields allow disks to be stable for higher surface\ndensities and larger total masses. These results indicate that magnetic fields\nact to suppress the formation of giant planets through gravitational\ninstability. Finally, even if gravitational instability can form a secondary\nbody, it must lose an enormous amount of magnetic flux in order to become a\nplanet; this latter requirement represents an additional constraint for planet\nformation via gravitational instability and places a lower limit on the\nelectrical resistivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 22:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Here we report evidence of condensate opacity in the near-infrared\nspectrum of the brown dwarf candidate Ross 458C, obtained with the Folded-Port\nInfrared Echellette (FIRE) spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes. These data\nverify the low-temperature nature of this source, indicating a T8 spectral\nclassification, log Lbol/Lsun = -5.62+/-0.03, Teff = 650+/-25 K, and a mass at\nor below the deuterium burning limit. The data also reveal enhanced emission at\nK-band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity,\nreflecting the properties of the Ross 458 system (age = 150-800 Myr, [Fe/H] =\n+0.2 to +0.3).

For Ross 458C we\nconfirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperature\ndiffers depending on the presence (635 [+25,-35] K) or absence (760 [+70,-45]\nK) of cloud extinction.

In all\nthree cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data,\nsignificantly so for Ross 458C.

We isolate the emission of\nthe gas by properly accounting for the emission from unresolved stellar\nsources, predominantly cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries,\nwhose quasi-universal X-ray emissivity is recently established. We find a gas\ntemperature of ~0.6 keV with little variation across the field of view, except\nfor a lower temperature of ~0.3 keV along the stellar disk. We measure a total\nintrinsic 0.3-2 keV luminosity of ~2e39 erg/s, which is comparable to the\nprediction by the latest galaxy formation models for disk galaxies as massive\nas Sombrero. However, such numerical models do not fully account for internal\nfeedback processes, such as nuclear feedback and stellar feedback, against\naccretion from the intergalactic medium. On the other hand, we find no evidence\nfor either the nucleus or the very modest star-forming activities in the disk\nto be a dominant heating source for the diffuse gas. We also show that neither\nthe expected energy released by Type Ia supernovae nor the expected mass\nreturned by evolved stars is recovered by observations. We argue that in\nSombrero a galactic-scale subsonic outflow of hot gas continuously removes much\nof the \"missing\" energy and mass input from the bulge region.

In this paper hierarchical mixture models\nare introduced to infer the extent of individualization. Hierarchical mixtures\nutilize complementary aspects of mixtures at different levels of the hierarchy.\nAt the first (top) level, a mixture is used to represent homogeneous groups of\nfingerprints in the population, whereas at the second level, nested mixtures\nare used as flexible representations of distributions of features from each\nfingerprint.

Rather then maintaining the full stream of $b$ items of a universe\n$[u]$, such methods only maintain a concise fingerprint of the stream, and\nperform computations using the fingerprints. The computations are done\napproximately, and the required fingerprint size $k$ depends on the desired\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ and confidence $\\delta$. Our technique maintains a single\nbit per hash function, rather than a single integer, thus requiring a\nfingerprint of length $k = O(\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1}{\\delta}}{\\epsilon^2})$ bits,\nrather than $O(\\log u \\cdot \\frac{\\ln \\frac{1}{\\delta}}{\\epsilon^2})$ bits\nrequired by previous approaches.

Abridged Although Li has been extensively\nstudied in the Galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertain\ndetection of Li in an unevolved bulge star. AIMS: Our aim with this study is to\nprovide the first clear detection of Li in the Galactic bulge, based on an\nanalysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial Li abundance.\nMETHODS: We have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulge\ndwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-285S using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noise\nspectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT when the object was\noptically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visual\nmagnification A~550 during observation). The lithium abundance was determined\nthrough synthetic line profile fitting of the 7Li resonance doublet line at\n670.8 nm. The results have been corrected for departures from LTE. Results:\nMOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected\nso far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]\nratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This\nstar represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf\nstar in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log\ne(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo\ndwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results\nshow that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic\nbulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega\nCen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau\nis universal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 07:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In order to address\nthe question of the habitability of GL 581 d, we performed detailed atmospheric\nmodeling studies for several planetary scenarios. A 1D radiative-convective\nmodel was used to calculate temperature and pressure profiles of model\natmospheres, assumed to be composed of molecular nitrogen, water, and carbon\ndioxide. The model allows for changing surface pressures caused by\nevaporation/condensation of water and carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the\ntreatment of the energy transport has been improved in the model to account in\nparticular for high CO2, high-pressure Super-Earth conditions. For four\nhigh-pressure scenarios of our study, the resulting surface temperatures were\nabove 273 K, indicating a potential habitability of the planet. These scenarios\ninclude three CO2-dominated atmospheres (95% CO2 concentration with 5, 10, and\n20 bar surface pressure) and a high-pressure CO2-enriched atmosphere (5% CO2\nconcentration with 20 bar surface pressure).

The level of secrecy of private information\nconfidential to the relay is measured by the equivocation rate, i.e., the\nentropy rate of private information conditioned on channel outputs at the\nrelay. The performance measure of interest for the RCC is the rate triple that\nincludes the common rate, the private rate, and the equivocation rate as\ncomponents. The rate-equivocation region is defined by the set that consists of\nall these achievable rate triples. In this paper we give two definitions of the\nrate-equivocation region.

A simple comparison of Kurucz\nmodel spectra with Mrcs and NextGen model spectra of identical stellar\nparameters was conducted and differences were present at near-infrared\nwavelengths. Model spectra often do not extend in wavelength to that of\nobservation and therefore extrapolation of the spectrum is required.

In the course of our CFHT and VLT\ncoronographic imaging survey dedicated to the search for faint companions of\nexoplanet host stars, a close (about 20 AU) secondary stellar companion to the\nexoplanet host HD196885 A was discovered.

We discuss their possible\nrelationship to periodic fluctuations of the proton density that have been\nidentified at 1 AU using in-situ plasma measurements. Specifically, Viall,\nKepko, and Spence (2008) examined 11 years of in-situ solar-wind density\nmeasurements at 1 AU and demonstrated that not only turbulent structures, but\nalso non-turbulent periodic density structures exist in the solar wind with\nscale sizes of hundreds to one thousand Mm. In a subsequent paper, Viall,\nSpence, and Kasper (2009) analyzed the {\\alpha} to proton solar-wind abundance\nratio measured during one such event of periodic density structures,\ndemonstrating that the plasma behavior was highly suggestive that either\ntemporally or spatially varying coronal source plasma created those density\nstructures. Large periodic density structures observed at 1 AU, which were\ngenerated in the corona, can be observable in coronal and heliospheric\nwhite-light images if they possess sufficiently high density contrast. Indeed,\nwe identify such periodic density structures as they enter the HI field of view\nand follow them as they advect with the solar wind through the images. The\nsmaller periodic density structures that we identify in the images are\ncomparable in size to the larger structures analyzed in-situ at 1 AU, yielding\nfurther evidence that periodic density enhancements are a consequence of\ncoronal activity as the solar wind is formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 14:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-30"}

The deflection of the cosmic ray trajectories makes the flux\nintensity arriving to the halo from some direction to appear reaching the Earth\nfrom another direction.

The latter is\nknown to present a structural instability which has not been found in Co3O2BO3.\nOur results show that bulk band structures present no significant differences.\nDifferences are found in the calculation of 1D stripes formed by 3+ 2+ 3+\ntriads, owed to different 3d occupancy of Fe and Co cations.

All the compositions show\nferromagnetic/metal to paramagnetic/insulator transition except the Pb doped\nsample which is insulating and ferromagnetic in the entire temperature range.\nThe simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in Pb\ndoped compound is most likely due to the presence of FM clusters separated by\nFe and Mn ions that are coupled AFM and hence prevent the current from crossing\nthe inter-domain region. The magnetization and Tc are decreased by decreasing\nthe Cation size on La site. We observed that (for a fixed Fe content of 5%) the\ntransition temperature and magnetic moment at 77 K is a maximum for Sr doped\nsample and is decreasing if we increase or decrease the cation size from Sr\nsize. The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most\nlikely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other\ndopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic\nmoment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size\nmismatch of the A site cations. This deviation leads to weakening of the FM\ndouble exchange (DE). We observed a spin freezing type effect in the Pb doped\nsample below 120 K in resistivity, AC susceptibility and in magnetization. This\nsuggests that the AFM interactions introduced by the Fe are most effective in\nthe Pb doped composition leading to increased competition between the FM and\nAFM interactions. This FM and AFM interaction generates some degree of\nfrustration leading to the appearance of spin glass like phase whose typical\nmagnetic behavior is studied for small ion when the metallic like behavior is\nlost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 14:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-30"}

We define kinematical close pairs as those\ngalaxies with a separation in the sky plane 5h^-1 kpc < r_p <= r_p^max and a\nrelative velocity Delta v <= 500 km s^-1 in redshift space. We vary r_p^max\nfrom 30h^-1 kpc to 100h^-1 kpc. We study f_m in two redshift intervals and for\nseveral values of mu, the B-band luminosity ratio of the galaxies in the pair,\nfrom 1/2 to 1/10. We take mu >= 1/4 and 1/10 <= mu < 1/4 as major and minor\nmergers. The merger fraction increases with z and its dependence on mu is\ndescribed well as f_m (>= mu) proportional to mu^s. The value of s evolves from\ns = -0.60 +- 0.08 at z = 0.8 to s = -1.02 +- 0.13 at z = 0.5. The fraction of\nminor mergers for bright galaxies evolves with redshift as a power-law (1+z)^m\nwith index m = -0.4 +- 0.7 for the merger fraction and m = -0.5 +- 0.7 for the\nmerger rate. We split our principal galaxies in red and blue by their\nrest-frame NUV-r colour, finding that i) f_m is higher for red galaxies, ii)\nf_m^red does not evolve with z, and iii) f_m^blue evolves dramatically. Our\nresults show that the mass of normal L_B >= L*_B galaxies has grown ~25% since\nz ~ 1 because of minor and major mergers. The relative contribution of the mass\ngrowth by merging is ~25% due to minor mergers and ~75% due to major ones. The\nrelative effect of merging is more important for red than for blue galaxies,\nwith red galaxies subject to 0.5 minor and 0.7 major mergers since z~1, which\nleads to a mass growth of ~40% and a size increase by a factor of 2. Our\nresults also suggest that, for blue galaxies, minor mergers likely lead to\nearly-type spirals rather than elliptical galaxies. These results show that\nminor merging is a significant but not dominant mechanism driving the mass\ngrowth of galaxies in the last ~8 Gyr (Abriged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 15:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 11:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-03"}

Multi-dimensional\nLangevin equations are employed to describe time-evolution of collective\ncoordinates with a time-dependent potential energy surface corresponding to\ndifferent stages of surrogate reactions. The new model is capable of\ncalculating spin distributions of the compound nuclei, one of the most\nimportant quantity in the surrogate technique. Furthermore, various observables\nof surrogate reactions can be calculated, e.g., energy and angular distribution\nof ejectile, and mass distributions of fission fragments. These features are\nimportant to assess validity of the proposed model itself, to understand\nmechanisms of the surrogate reactions and to determine unknown parameters of\nthe model.

Plane-wave reflection and transmission\ncoefficients at the interfaces are regarded as additional unknowns to be\ndetermined, rather than explicitly dependent on the material parameters. Our\ntechnique is thus analogous to the line-reflect-line (LRL) calibration method\nin microwave measurements. The refractive index can be determined from\nS-parameters for two samples of different thickness. The effective wave\nimpedance requires the additional assumption that generalized sheet transition\nconditions (GSTCs) account for the boundary effects.
