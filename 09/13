Then the\nMass-Boom is directly related to the existence of gravity. The principle of\nMach implies that the Mass-Boom is responsible for the expansion of the\nuniverse. Thus, the Mass-Boom effect is a necessary condition for: 1) the\nincrease of entropy with time, 2) the existence of gravity, and 3) for the\nexpansion of the universe. The universe seems to initially appear and grow out\nof polarization: positive mass-boom (energy) versus negative gravitational\npotential energy boom, adding both always to zero. Polarization is then the\ncause of creation and evolution of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 18:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}

Unlike previous work that assumes some prior knowledge of the\neavesdropper's channel and focuses on maximizing secrecy capacity, we consider\nthe case where no information regarding the eavesdropper is available, and we\nuse signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) as our performance metric.\nSpecifically, we focus on the problem of maximizing the amount of power\navailable to broadcast a jamming signal intended to hide the desired signal\nfrom a potential eavesdropper, while maintaining a prespecified SINR at the\ndesired receiver.

Previous attempts which assumed\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity failed due to a tachyonic instability of the\nsinglet field during inflation. A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the\n(N)MSSM, the K\\\"{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with\na certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift\nsymmetry for singlets in earlier models. We find that K-flat direction has\n$H_u^0=-H_d^{0*}.$ This shift symmetry is broken by interactions coming from\nthe superpotential and gauge fields. This direction fails to produce successful\ninflation in the MSSM but produces a viable model in the NMSSM. The model is\nspecifically interesting in the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) limit of the NMSSM. In this\nlimit the model can be confirmed or ruled-out not just by cosmic microwave\nbackground observations but also by axion searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 00:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2010 21:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 09:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

We show\nthat the gamma-ray spectrum from 47 Tuc can be explained equally well by upward\nscattering of either the relic photons, the galactic infrared photons or the\ngalactic star lights whereas the gamma-ray spectra from other seven globular\nclusters are best fitted by the upward scattering of either the galactic\ninfrared photons or the galactic star lights.

Recently, iterative reconstruction algorithms\nwith Total Variation (TV) regularization have been developed to reconstruct CT\nimages from highly undersampled data acquired at low mAs levels in order to\nreduce the imaging dose. Nonetheless, TV regularization may lead to\nover-smoothed images and lost edge information. To solve this problem, in this\nwork we develop an iterative CT reconstruction algorithm with edge-preserving\nTV regularization to reconstruct CT images from highly undersampled data\nobtained at low mAs levels. The CT image is reconstructed by minimizing an\nenergy consisting of an edge-preserving TV norm and a data fidelity term posed\nby the x-ray projections. The edge-preserving TV term is proposed to\npreferentially perform smoothing only on non-edge part of the image in order to\navoid over-smoothing, which is realized by introducing a penalty weight to the\noriginal total variation norm. Our iterative algorithm is implemented on GPU to\nimprove its speed. We test our reconstruction algorithm on a digital NCAT\nphantom, a physical chest phantom, and a Catphan phantom. Reconstruction\nresults from a conventional FBP algorithm and a TV regularization method\nwithout edge preserving penalty are also presented for comparison purpose. The\nexperimental results illustrate that both TV-based algorithm and our\nedge-preserving TV algorithm outperform the conventional FBP algorithm in\nsuppressing the streaking artifacts and image noise under the low dose context.\nOur edge-preserving algorithm is superior to the TV-based algorithm in that it\ncan preserve more information of fine structures and therefore maintain\nacceptable spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 02:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 01:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We propose and study a minimal model of signaling network that can sense\nand respond to external stimuli of varying strength in an adaptive manner. The\nstructure of this minimal network is derived based on some simple assumptions\non its differential response to external stimuli. We employ stochastic\ndifferential equations and probability distributions obtained from stochastic\nsimulations to characterize differential signaling response in our minimal\nnetwork model. We show that the proposed minimal signaling network displays two\ndistinct types of response as the strength of the stimulus is decreased. The\nsignaling network has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a\nstrong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the\nstrength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins\ndominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with\ncharacteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability. Interestingly, this\nproposed stochastic signaling network can capture some of the essential\nsignaling behaviors of a complex apoptotic cell death signaling network that\nhas been studied through experiments and large-scale computer simulations. Thus\nwe claim that the proposed signaling network is an appropriate minimal model of\napoptosis signaling.

The large data set of more\nthan 44,000 spectra allows us to identify an empirical baseline floor for\nchromospheric activity as a function of color and height above the main\nsequence. We define $\\Delta S$ as an excess in emission in the Ca II H\\&K lines\nabove the baseline activity floor and define radial velocity jitter as a\nfunction of $\\Delta S$ and \\bv\\ for main sequence and subgiant stars. Although\nthe jitter for any individual star can always exceed the baseline level, we\nfind that K dwarfs have the lowest level of jitter. The lack of correlation\nbetween observed jitter and chromospheric activity in K dwarfs suggests that\nthe observed jitter is dominated by instrumental or analysis errors and not\nastrophysical noise sources. Thus, given the long-term precision for the CPS\nprogram, radial velocities are not correlated with astrophysical noise for\nchromospherically quiet K dwarf stars, making these stars particularly\nwell-suited for the highest precision Doppler surveys. Chromospherically quiet\nF and G dwarfs and subgiants exhibit higher baseline levels of astrophysical\njitter than K dwarfs.

The sources with methanol emission with\nring-like morphologies, which likely trace a circumstellar disk/torus, either\ndo not show associated water masers or the distribution of water maser spots is\northogonal to the major axis of the ring. The two maser species are generally\npowered by the same high-mass young stellar object but probe different parts of\nits environment. The morphology of water and methanol maser emission in a\nminority of sources is consistent with a scenario that 6.7 GHz methanol masers\ntrace a disc/torus around a protostar while the associated 22 GHz water masers\narise in outflows. The majority of sources in which methanol maser emission is\nassociated with the water maser appears to trace outflows. The two types of\nassociations might be related to different evolutionary phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 09:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The conditions for achieving the full effect in either\ncase are different. Here we discuss related questions in the context of an\noptical resonator. When shaping a laser pulse properly it will be fully\nabsorbed by an optical resonator, i.e., no light will be reflected and all the\npulse energy will accumulate inside the resonator before it starts leaking out.\nWe show in detail that in this case the temporal pulse shape has to match the\ntime-reversed pulse obtained by the cavity's free decay. On the other hand a\nresonator, made of highly reflecting mirrors which normally reflect a large\nportion of any incident light, may fully transmit the light, as long as the\nlight is narrow band and resonant with the cavity. The analogy is the single\natom - normally letting most of the light pass - which under special conditions\nmay fully reflect the incident light beam. Using this analogy we are able to\nstudy the effects of practical experimental limitations in the atom-photon\ncoupling, such as finite pulses, bandwidths, and solid angle coverage, and to\nuse the optical resonator as a test bed for the implementation of the quantum\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 12:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}

Studies\nhave shown that on-demand routing protocols perform better than table-driven\nrouting protocols. In order to avoid route discovery for each packet, on-demand\nrouting protocols cache routes previously learnt. A node in ad hoc network\nlearns routing information by overhearing or forwarding packets to other nodes\nand keep learned routes in its route cache. However, node movement results\nbroken links and therefore increases risk of cache pollution. Ensuring cache\nfreshness in on-demand routing protocols, therefore, presents a serious\nchallenge. A lot of research has been done in route cache organization,\nhowever, little effort has been done for route cache timeout policy to prevent\nstale routes from being used.

We conclude that the massive\nejection of large (optically-thin) particles from the surface at the time of\nthe outburst is the triggering mechanism to produce the outburst. Ulterior\nsublimation of these ice-rich dust particles during the following days induces\nfragmentation, generating micrometer-sized grains that increase the dust\nspatial density to produce the outburst in the optical range due to scattering\nof sun light. The material leaving the nucleus adopts a fan-like dust feature,\nformed by micrometer-sized particles that are decaying in brightness as it\nevolved outwards. By analyzing the photometric signal measured in a\nstandardized 10-arcsec aperture using the Phase Dispersion Minimization\ntechnique we have found a clear periodicity of 50 days.

The dust-mass distributions are taken from recent\nmillimetre-wavelength data and fitted using survival analysis to take into\naccount upper limits, and threshold disc-masses for building planets and belts\nof comets are estimated. Amongst A-stars, 20% gas giant and 55% debris disc\nsystems are predicted, in good agreement with observations.

This test confirms,\nin all cases, that there is genuine line emission, that the detected line is\nhydrogen alpha, and that the satellites have similar recession velocities to\ntheir hosts with a maximum difference of ~ 250 km/s, consistent with their\nbeing gravitationally bound companions. We conclude that the spectroscopy has\nconfirmed that narrow-band imaging through H alpha filters is a reliable method\nfor detecting genuine, star-forming satellites with low contamination from\ngalaxies seen in projection along the line-of-sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 13:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It can be shown that\nthe polynomial approximant Xi(n,t,beta) to Xi(t) has distinct real roots only\nin the asymptotic scaling limit beta->infinity. One may therefore infer the\nexistence of increasing beta-sequences beta(n)->infinity for n->infinity, such\nthat Xi(n,t,beta(n)) has real roots only for all n, and to each entire function\nit is possible to associate a unique minimal beta-sequence fulfilling a\nspecific difference equation.\n  Numerical analysis indicates that the minimal beta(n) sequence associated\nwith the Riemann Xi(t) has a distinct sub-logarithmic growth rate, and it can\nbe shown that the approximant Xi(n,t,beta(n)) converges to Xi(t) when\nn->infinity if beta(n)=o(log (n)). Invoking the Hurwitz theorem of complex\nanalysis, and applying a formal analysis of the asymptotic properties of\nminimal beta-sequences, a fundamental mechanism is identified which provides a\ncompelling confirmation of the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 09:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2011 10:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-22"}
