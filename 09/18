The basic problem is to design optimal\nlinear transceivers (or beamformers) that can maximize system throughput. The\nrecent work [1] suggests that optimal beamformers should maximize the total\ndegrees of freedom and achieve interference alignment in high SNR. In this\npaper we first consider the interference alignment problem in spatial domain\nand prove that the problem of maximizing the total degrees of freedom for a\ngiven MIMO interference channel is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that even\nchecking the achievability of a given tuple of degrees of freedom for all\nreceivers is NP-hard when each receiver is equipped with at least three\nantennas. Interestingly, the same problem becomes polynomial time solvable when\neach transmit/receive node is equipped with no more than two antennas. Finally,\nwe propose a distributed algorithm for transmit covariance matrix design, while\nassuming each receiver uses a linear MMSE beamformer. The simulation results\nshow that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing interference\nalignment algorithms in terms of system throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 18:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-20"}

The first\nchallenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it\nalso determines the dimension of the capture probabilities in heterogeneity\nmodels. A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture\nprobabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian\ninference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two such examples of this\napproach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional MCMC, and (ii) superpopulation data\naugmentation. The superpopulation approach has the advantage of simple\nspecification that is easily implemented in BUGS and related software. However,\nit reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as\na derived quantity. This is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance,\nor related parameters, are desired. Here, we analytically compare the two\napproaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear\nsuperficially. We exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that\nallows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical\nmodeling using readily available software such as BUGS.

To mitigate this conflict, we propose a middle way which we term\nshared access in which femtocells allocate an adjustable number of time-slots\nbetween home and cellular users such that a specified minimum rate for each can\nbe achieved. The optimal such sharing fraction is derived. Analysis shows that\nshared access achieves at least the overall throughput of open access while\nalso satisfying rate requirements, while closed access fails for cellular users\nand open access fails for the home user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 23:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Taking\naccount of interference between the s-channel slepton exchange and the\n$t$-channel squark exchange diagrams, we find that the supersymmetric\ncontributions are cancelled between two diagrams so that the RPV couplings\ncould be sizable under the experimental bounds. Constraints on the relative\nsign between the RPV couplings in $s$- and $t$-channel diagrams are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2010 14:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 21:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-24"}

The general formulations developed by Chirikov is applied\nto the Nesvorn\\'{y}-Morbidelli analytic model of three-body (three-orbit)\nmean-motion resonances (Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid system). In particular, we\ninvestigate the diffusion \\emph{along} and \\emph{across} the separatrices of\nthe (5,-2,-2) resonance of the (490) Veritas asteroidal family and their\nrelationship to diffusion in semi-major axis and eccentricity. The estimations\nof diffusion were obtained using the Melnikov integral, a Hadjidemetriou-type\nsympletic map and numerical integrations for times up to $10^{8}$ years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2010 14:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

However, this was never\ndefinitively demonstrated. We have found that the standard conformal method of\nsolving the Einstein constraints has an unexpected extra symmetry.

We show that given a point and a velocity in\nconformal superspace, the Einstein equations generate a unique curve in\nconformal superspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2010 15:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

In a flow/velocity vector field\nmethod, we explore the data in the discrete lattices of the macro-level social\nstrategy space in the games, and then above spiral pattern emergent. This\nfinding hints that, there exists a macro-level order beyond the stochastic\nprocess in micro-level.
