The main contribution of this paper is to\npropose Unlocking CSMA (U-CSMA) policy that enables to obtain high throughput\nwith low (average) packet delay for large wireless networks. In particular, the\ndelay under U-CSMA policy becomes order-optimal. For one-hop traffic, delay is\ndefined to be order-optimal if it is O(1), i.e., it stays bounded, as the\nnetwork-size increases to infinity. Using mean field theory techniques, we\nanalytically show that for torus (grid-like) interference topologies with\none-hop traffic, to achieve a network load of $\\rho$, the delay under U-CSMA\npolicy becomes $O(1/(1-\\rho)^{3})$ as the network-size increases, and hence,\ndelay becomes order optimal. We conduct simulations for general random\ngeometric interference topologies under U-CSMA policy combined with congestion\ncontrol to maximize a network-wide utility. These simulations confirm that\norder optimality holds, and that we can use U-CSMA policy jointly with\ncongestion control to operate close to the optimal utility with a low packet\ndelay in arbitrarily large random geometric topologies.

In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star. We\nconclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is\nlikely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a\nuseful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp. In the\ncase of WASP-12b, we derive an upper limit of about Bp=24 G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 17:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-30"}

In this paper, it is further demonstrated that in the\ncase of multiple relays, there is no improvement on the achievable rate by\njoint decoding either. More interestingly, it is discovered that any\ncompressions not supporting successive decoding will actually lead to strictly\nlower achievable rates for the original message. Therefore, to maximize the\nachievable rate for the original message, the compressions should always be\nchosen to support successive decoding. Furthermore, it is shown that any\ncompressions not completely decodable even with joint decoding will not provide\nany contribution to the decoding of the original message.\n  The above phenomenon is also shown to exist under the repetitive encoding\nframework recently proposed by (Lim, Kim, El Gamal, and Chung, 2010), which\nimproved the achievable rate in the case of multiple relays. Here, another\ninteresting discovery is that the improvement is not a result of repetitive\nencoding, but the benefit of delayed decoding after all the blocks have been\nfinished. The same rate is shown to be achievable with the simpler classical\nencoding process of (Cover and El Gamal, 1979) with a block-by-block backward\ndecoding process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 17:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 01:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 14:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-22"}

Unlike other blind algorithms,\nit only uses the second order statistics. A key assumption in the previous work\nis that the two matrices have the same interference statistics. However, this\nassumption may be invalid in the presence of multipath propagations or certain\n\"smart\" jammers, and we call it as matrix mismatch. This paper analyzes the\nperformance of MPB with matrix mismatch. First, we propose a general framework\nthat covers the existing schemes. Then, we derive its normalized output SINR.\nIt reveals that the matrix mismatch leads to a threshold effect caused by\n\"steering vector competition\". Second, using matrix perturbation theory, we\nfind that, if there are generalized eigenvalues that are infinite, the\nthreshold will increase unboundedly with the interference power. This is highly\nprobable when there are multiple periodical interferers. Finally, we present\nsimulation results to verify our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 19:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 07:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 07:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 15:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

To analyze\nsuch small-scale and medium-scale data in an empirical Bayes framework, we\nintroduce corrections of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the local false\ndiscovery rate (LFDR). In this context, the MLE estimates the LFDR, which is a\nposterior probability of null hypothesis truth, by estimating the prior\ndistribution. The corrections lie in excluding each feature when estimating one\nor more parameters on which the prior depends. An application of the new\nestimators and previous estimators to protein abundance data illustrates how\ndifferent estimators lead to very different conclusions about which proteins\nare affected by cancer.\n  The estimators are compared using simulated data of two different numbers of\nfeatures, two different detectability levels, and all possible numbers of\naffected features. The simulations show that some of the corrected MLEs\nsubstantially reduce a negative bias of the MLE. (The best-performing corrected\nMLE was derived from the minimum description length principle.) However, even\nthe corrected MLEs have strong negative biases when the proportion of features\nthat are unaffected is greater than 90%. Therefore, since the number of\naffected features is unknown in the case of real data, we recommend an\noptimally weighted combination of the best of the corrected MLEs with a\nconservative estimator that has weaker parametric assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 19:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 23:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

Current\ntheoretical simple stellar population (SSP) models constructed within the\ntraditional framework of single and binary stellar evolution cannot fully\naccount for the impact of these objects on the integrated spectral properties\nof stellar populations. Using conventional SSP models without taking into\naccount BS contributions may significantly underestimate a cluster's age and/or\nmetallicity, simply because one has to balance the observed bluer colours (or a\nbluer spectrum) with a younger age and/or a lower metallicity.

Our optical spectra show Halpha emission from several H II\nregions in this arm located ~5 arcsec from the quasar position (~2 kpc in\nprojection) and our ground-based Halpha images reveal the presence of several\nadditional H II regions in an inclined disk near the galaxy's center.\nAbsorption associated with ESO 1327-2041 is found in H I 21-cm, optical, and\nnear-UV spectra of PKS 1327-206. We find two absorption components at cz = 5255\nand 5510 km/s in the H I 21-cm absorption spectrum, which match the velocities\nof previously discovered metal-line components. We attribute the 5510 km/s\nabsorber to disk gas in the extended spiral arm and the 5255 km/s absorber to\nhigh-velocity gas that has been tidally stripped from the disk of ESO\n1327-2041. The complexity of the galaxy/absorber relationships for these very\nnearby H I 21-cm absorbers suggests that the standard view of high redshift\ndamped Lyman-alpha absorbers is oversimplified in many cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 18:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-15"}

These differences have led to the view that the\nthick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidence\nof the hierarchical growth of the Milky Way. We show here, using N-body\nsimulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellar\npopulations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internal\nevolution. In this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearly\ncircular orbits, as described by Sellwood & Binney (2002). As stars move\noutwards they populate a thickened component. Such stars found at the present\ntime in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smaller\nradii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to the\nproperties observed for thick disk stars. Classifying stars as members of the\nthin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent\nseparation in the other property as observed. This scenario is supported by the\nSDSS observation that stars in the transition region do not show any\ncorrelation between rotational velocity and metallicity. The good qualitative\nagreement between our simulation and observations in the Milky Way hint that\nthe thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellar\nmigration. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the thick disk\nis a fossil of a past more violent history, nor can this scenario explain thick\ndisks in all galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 20:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The model is based on a linear\ncombination of stochastic processes and is also the solution to the linear\ndiffusion equation perturbed by a spatially correlated noise field. This allows\nflexible modeling of the power spectral density (PSD), and we derive the\nlikelihood function for the process, enabling one to estimate the parameters of\nthe process, including break frequencies in the PSD. Our statistical technique\nis computationally efficient, unbiased by aliasing and red noise leak, and\nfully accounts for irregular sampling and measurement errors. We show that our\nstochastic model provides a good approximation to the X-ray lightcurves of\ngalactic black holes, and the optical and X-ray lightcurves of AGN. We use the\nestimated time scales of our stochastic model to recover the correlation\nbetween characteristic time scale of the high frequency X-ray fluctuations and\nblack hole mass for AGN, including two new `detections' of the time scale for\nFairall 9 and NGC 5548. We find a tight anti-correlation between the black hole\nmass and the amplitude of the driving noise field, which is proportional to the\namplitude of the high frequency X-ray PSD, and we estimate that this parameter\ngives black hole mass estimates to within ~ 0.2 dex precision, potentially the\nmost accurate method for AGN yet. We also find evidence that ~ 13% of AGN\noptical PSDs fall off flatter than 1 / f^2, and, similar to previous work, find\nthat the optical fluctuations are more suppressed on short time scales compared\nto the X-rays, but are larger on long time scales, suggesting the optical\nfluctuations are not solely due to reprocessing of X-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2010 22:11:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 21:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Our main result\nis an exact characterization of the probability that a particular labeled cycle\nexists in this random graph. For $\\sigma = 2$ and $\\sigma = \\infty$, we use\nthis characterization to derive a series which evaluates to the cycle\nprobability. We thus obtain an exact formula for the expected number of\nHamilton cycles in the random graph (when $\\sigma = \\infty$ and $\\sigma = 2$).\nWe also consider the adjacency matrix of the random graph and derive a\nrecurrence relation for the expected values of the elementary symmetric\nfunctions evaluated on the eigenvalues (and thus the determinant) of the\nadjacency matrix, and a recurrence relation for the expected value of the\npermanent of the adjacency matrix. The cycle probability features prominently\nin these recurrence relations. We calculate these quantities for geometric\nrandom graphs (in the $\\sigma = 2$ and $\\sigma = \\infty$ case) with up to $20$\nvertices, and compare them with the corresponding quantities for the\nErd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi (ER) random graph with the same edge probabilities. The\ncalculations indicate that the threshold for rapid growth in the number of\nHamilton cycles (as well as that for rapid growth in the permanent of the\nadjacency matrix) in the GR graph is lower than in the ER graph. However, as\nthe number of vertices $n$ increases, the difference between the GR and ER\nthresholds reduces, and in both cases, the threshold $\\sim \\log(n)/n$. Also, we\nobserve that the expected determinant can take very large values.

The inversion is carried out under the hypothesis of\nMISMA, where the unresolved structure is assumed to be optically thin. We\nanalyze a 29.52\"x31.70\" subfield carefully selected to be representative of the\nproperties of a 302\"x162\" quiet Sun field-of-view at disk center. The inversion\ncode is able to reproduce the observed asymmetries in a very satisfactory way.\nThe inversion code interprets 25% of inverted profiles as emerging from pixels\nin which both positive and negative polarities coexist. kG field strengths are\nfound at the base of the photosphere in both network and IN; in the case of the\nlatter, both kG fields and hG fields are admixed. When considering the magnetic\nproperties at the mid photosphere most kG fields are gone, and the statistics\nis dominated by hG fields. We constrain the magnetic field of only 4.5% of the\nanalyzed photosphere (and this percentage reduces to 1.3% when referred to all\npixels, including those with low polarization not analyzed). The rest of the\nplasma is consistent with the presence of weak fields not contributing to the\ndetected polarization signals. The average flux densities derived in the full\nsubfield and in IN regions are higher than the ones derived from the same\ndataset by Milne-Eddington inversion. The existence of large asymmetries in\nSOT/SP polarization profiles is uncovered. These are not negligible in quiet\nSun data. The MISMA inversion code reproduces them in a satisfactory way, and\nprovides a statistical description of the magnetized IN and network which\npartly differs and complements the results obtained so far. From this it\nfollows the importance of having a complete interpretation of the line profile\nshapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 08:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 08:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Matthews introduced the notion of partial metric space in order\nto obtain a suitable mathematical tool for program verification [Ann. New York\nAcad. Sci. 728 (1994), 183-197]. He gave an application of this new structure\nto parallel computing by means of a partial metric version of the celebrated\nBanach fixed point theorem [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 151 (1995), 195-205]. Later\non, M.P. Schellekens introduced the theory of complexity (quasi-metric) spaces\nas a part of the development of a topological foundation for the asymptotic\ncomplexity analysis of programs and algorithms [Elec- tronic Notes in Theoret.\nComput. Sci. 1 (1995), 211-232]. The applicability of this theory to the\nasymptotic complexity analysis of Divide and Conquer algorithms was also\nillustrated by Schellekens. In particular, he gave a new proof, based on the\nuse of the aforenamed Banach fixed point theorem, of the well-known fact that\nMergesort al- gorithm has optimal asymptotic average running time of computing.\nIn this paper, motivated by the utility of partial metrics in Computer Science,\nwe discuss whether the Matthews fixed point theorem is a suitable tool to\nanalyze the asymptotic complexity of algorithms in the spirit of Schellekens.\nSpecifically, we show that a slight modification of the well-known Baire\npartial metric on the set of all words over an alphabet constitutes an\nappropriate tool to carry out the asymptotic complexity analysis of algorithms\nvia fixed point methods without the need for assuming the convergence condition\ninherent to the defini- tion of the complexity space in the Shellekens\nframework. Finally, in order to illustrate and to validate the developed theory\nwe apply our results to analyze the asymptotic complexity of Quicksort,\nMergesort and Largesort algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 11:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-01"}

We present the results of high resolution 3-D\ncosmological simulations of primordial objects formation using the adaptive\nmesh refinement code FLASH by including in an approximate manner the radiative\ntransfer effects of Lyman alpha photons. We compare the results of a Lyman\nalpha trapping case inside gas clouds with atomic and molecular hydrogen\ncooling cases.The principal objective of this research is to follow the\ncollapse of a zero metallicity halo with an effective equation of state (that\naccounts for the trapping) and to explore the fate of a halo in each of the\nthree cases, specifically, the impact of thermodynamics on fragmentation of\nhalos.Our results show that in the case of Lyman alpha trapping, fragmentation\nis halted and a massive object is formed at the center of a halo. The\ntemperature of the gas remains well above $10^{4}$ K and the halo is not able\nto fragment to stellar masses. In the atomic cooling case, gas collapses into\none or two massive clumps in contrast to the Lyman alpha trapping case. For the\nmolecular hydrogen cooling case, gas cools efficiently and fragments.The\nformation of massive primordial objects is thus strongly dependent on the\nthermodynamics of the gas. A salient feature of our results is that for the\nformation of massive objects, e.g. intermediate mass black holes, feedback\neffects are not required to suppress $H_{2}$ cooling, as molecular hydrogen is\ncollisionally dissociated at temperatures higher than $10^{4}$ K as a\nconsequence of Lyman alpha trapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 12:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Specifically we suggest that $c$ can be determined by\n$c = L/\\beta$ when the squares of the spatial and temporal winding numbers are\ntuned to be the same in the Monte Carlo calculations. Here $\\beta$ and $L$ are\nthe inverse temperature and the box size used in the simulations when this\ncondition is met. We verify the validity of this idea by simulating the quantum\nspin-1/2 XY model. The $c$ obtained by using the squares of winding numbers is\ngiven by $c = 1.1348(5)Ja$ which is consistent with the known values of $c$ in\nthe literature. Unlike other conventional approaches, our new idea provides a\ndirect method to measure $c$. Further, by simultaneously fitting our Monte\nCarlo data of susceptibilities $\\chi_{11}$ and spin susceptibilities $\\chi$ to\ntheir theoretical predictions from magnon chiral perturbation theory, we find\n$c$ is given by $c = 1.1347(2)Ja$ which agrees with the one we obtain by the\nnew method of using the squares of winding numbers.

Firstly, we have carried out sensitivity analysis on\nan existing mitochondria-dependent mathematical apoptosis model to find out\nwhich parameters have a role in causing monostable cell survival i.e.,\nmalfunction in apoptosis. We have then generated three healthy cell models by\nchanging these sensitive parameters while preserving bistability i.e., healthy\nfunctioning. For each healthy cell, we varied the proapoptotic production\nrates, which were found to be among the most sensitive parameters, to yield\ncells that have malfunctioning apoptosis. We simulated caspase-3 activation, by\nnumerically integrating the governing ordinary differential equations of a\nmitochondria-dependent apoptosis model, in a hypothetical malfunctioning cell\nwhich is treated by four potential treatments, namely: (i) proteasome inhibitor\ntreatment, (ii) Bcl-2 inhibitor treatment, (iii) IAP inhibitor treatment, (iv)\nBid-like synthetic peptides treatment. The simulations of the present model\nsuggest that proteasome inhibitor treatment is the most effective treatment\nthough it may have severe side effects. For this treatment, we observed that\nthe amount of proteasome inhibitor needed for caspase-3 activation may be\ndifferent for cells in individuals with a different proapoptotic protein\ndeficiency. We also observed that caspase-3 can be activated by Bcl-2 inhibitor\ntreatment only in those hypothetical malfunctioning cells with Bax deficiency\nbut not in others. These support the view that molecular heterogeneity in\nindividuals may be an important factor in determining the individuals' positive\nor negative responses to treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 15:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-01"}

This characteristic feature is called homochirality, whose origin\nis still unknown. The route to homogeneity of chirality would be connected with\nthe origin and development of life on early Earth along with evolution of the\nsolar system. Detections of enantiomeric excess in several meteorites support\nthe possibility that the seed of life was injected from space, considering the\npossible destruction and racemization in the perilous environment on early\nEarth. Circularly polarized light could bring the enantiomeric excess of\nprebiotic molecules in space. Recent experimental works on photochemistry under\nultraviolet circularly polarized light are remarkable. Recent astronomical\nobservations by imaging polarimetry of star-forming regions are now revealing\nthe distribution of circularly polarized light in space. Astrobiological view\non chirality of life would contribute to understanding of the origin and\ndevelopment of life, from the birth and the end of stars and planetary systems\nin space. Deep insights on terrestrial life, extrasolar life, and the origin of\nlife in the universe, would be brought by consideration of both of the place\nwhere life is able to live, the \"habitable\" zone, and the place where life is\nable to originate, what we shall call the \"originable\" zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 15:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-08"}
