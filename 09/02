Piezoelectricity in ceramic FEs differ significantly from\nthat of single crystals because of the presence of crystallites (grains)\npossessing crystallographic axes aligned imperfectly. The piezoelectric\nproperties of a polycrystalline (ceramic) FE is inextricably related to the\ngrain orientation distribution (texture). The set of combination of variables,\nknown as solution space, which dictates the texture of a ceramic is unlimited\nand hence the choice of the optimal solution which maximizes the\npiezoelectricity is complicated. Thus a stochastic global optimization combined\nwith homogenization is employed for the identification of the optimal granular\nconfiguration of the FE ceramic microstructure with optimum piezoelectric\nproperties. The macroscopic equilibrium piezoelectric properties of\npolycrystalline FE is calculated using mathematical homogenization at each\niteration step. The configuration of grains characterised by its orientations\nat each iteration is generated using a randomly selected set of orientation\ndistribution parameters. Apparent enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient\n$d_{33}$ is observed in an optimally oriented BaTiO$_3$ single crystal. A\nconfiguration of crystallites, simultaneously constraining the orientation\ndistribution of the c-axis (polar axis) while incorporating ab-plane\nrandomness, which would multiply the overall piezoelectricity in ceramic\nBaTiO$_{3}$ is also identified. The orientation distribution of the c-axes is\nfound to be a narrow Gaussian distribution centred around ${45^\\circ}$. The\npiezoelectric coefficient in such a ceramic is found to be nearly three times\nas that of the single crystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 16:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-02"}

This in turn\nappears to require a rapidly spinning highly magnetised stellar core that\ncollapses into a magnetic neutron star or a black hole within a relatively\nmassive envelope. They appear to be associated with type Ib/c supernovae but,\nwith a birthrate of around 10^{-6}-10^{-5} per year per galaxy, they are\nconsiderably rarer than such supernovae in general. To satisfy all these\nrequirements we hypothesize a binary star model that ends with the merging of\nan oxygen neon white dwarf with the carbon-oxygen core of a naked helium star\nduring a common envelope phase of evolution. The rapid spin and high magnetic\nfield are natural consequences of such a merging. The evolution that leads to\nthese progenitors is convoluted and so naturally occurs only very rarely. To\ntest the hypothesis we evolve a population of progenitors and find that the\nrate is as required. At low metallicity we calculate that a similar fraction of\nstars evolve to this point and so would expect the gamma-ray burst rate to\ncorrelate with the star formation rate in any galaxy. This too is consistent\nwith observations. These progenitors, being of intermediate mass, differ\nradically from the usually postulated high-mass stars. Thus we can reconcile\nobservations that the bursts occur close to but not within massive star\nassociations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 16:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Recently, a number of\nsilicon-based optical devices including modulators, buffers, and wavelength\nconverts have been reported. However, a number of technical challenges need to\nbe overcome before these devices can be combined into network-level\narchitectures. In particular, due to the high refractive index contrast between\nthe core and cladding of semiconductor waveguides, nanoscale defects along the\nwaveguide often scatter light into the backward-propagating mode. These\nreflections could result in unwanted feedback to optical sources or crosstalk\nin bidirectional interconnects such as those employed in fiber-optic networks.\nIt is often assumed that these reflected waves spatially overlap the\nforward-propagating waves making it difficult to implement optical circulators\nor isolators which separate or attenuate light based on its propagation\ndirection. Here, we individually identify and map the near-field mode profiles\nof forward-propagating and reflected light in a single-mode silicon waveguide\nusing Transmission-based near-field scanning optical microscopy (TraNSOM). We\nshow that unlike fiber-optic waveguides, the high-index-contrast and nanoscale\ndimensions of semiconductor waveguides create counter propagating waves with\ndistinct spatial near-field profiles. These near-field differences are a\npreviously-unobserved consequence of nanoscale light confinement and could\nprovide a basis for novel elements to filter forward-propagating from reflected\nlight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 19:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

End\nuser business intelligence tools are added on top of the materialized\nmultidimensional schemas to drive decision making in an organization.\nUnfortunately, this bottom-up approach is costly both in terms of the skilled\nusers needed and the sheer size of the warehouses. This paper proposes a\ntop-down framework in which data warehousing is driven by a conceptual model.\nThe framework offers both design time and run time environments. At design\ntime, a business user first uses the conceptual modeling language as a\nmultidimensional object model to specify what business information is needed;\nthen she maps the conceptual model to a pre-existing logical multidimensional\nrepresentation. At run time, a system will transform the user conceptual model\ntogether with the mappings into views over the logical multidimensional\nrepresentation. We focus on how the user can conceptually abstract from an\nexisting data warehouse, and on how this conceptual model can be mapped to the\nlogical multidimensional representation. We also give an indication of what\nquery language is used over the conceptual model.

Combining these\neffects properly, one can make the instability found in the Minkowski\nbackground never appear even for small-scale modes, provided that the IR limit\nis sufficiently closed to the relativistic fixed point. At the fixed point, all\nthe modes become stabilized. We also show that the instability of Minkowski\nspacetime can be cured by introducing mass to the spin-0 graviton. The strong\ncoupling problem is investigated following the effective field theory approach,\nand found that it cannot be cured by the Blas-Pujolas-Sibiryakov mechanism,\ninitially designed for the case without projectability condition, but might be\ncircumvented by the Vainshtein mechanism, due to the non-linear effects.

In two\nseparate fields, a total of 160 individual galaxies has been detected in\nneutral hydrogen, with HI masses varying from 1.1x10^9 to 4.0x10^10 Msun. The\nlargest galaxies are spatially resolved by the synthesized beam of 23x37\narcsec^2 while the velocity resolution of 19 km/s allowed the HI emission lines\nto be well resolved. The large scale structure in the surveyed volume is traced\nwell in HI, apart from the highest density regions like the cores of galaxy\nclusters. All significant HI detections have obvious or plausible optical\ncounterparts which are usually blue late-type galaxies that are UV-bright.

We find that there are no regions\nshowing strong flux variations. Our analysis shows an apparent flux decline in\nthe overall synchrotron flux of about 4% at high energies, but we suspect that\nthis is mostly a calibration effect, and that flux is actually constant to\nabout 1%. This is much less than the variation found in other remnants where it\nwas used to infer magnetic-field strengths up to 1 mG. We attribute the lack of\nvariability to the smoothness of the synchrotron morphology, in contrast to the\nsmall-scale knots found to be variable in other remnants. The smoothness is to\nbe expected for a Type Ia remnant encountering uniform material. Finally we\nfind a spatial correlation between the flux and the cut-off frequency in\nsynchrotron emission. The simplest interpretation is that the cut-off frequency\ndepends on the magnetic-field strength. This would require that the maximum\nenergy of accelerated electrons is not limited by synchrotron losses, but by\nsome other effect. Alternatively, the rate of particle injection and\nacceleration may vary due to some effect not yet accounted for, such as a\ndependence on shock obliquity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 21:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We\nverify that in less extreme star forming environments, similar to Orion, the\nstellar density is low enough that collisions are unimportant, but that\nconditions suitable for stellar collisions are much more easily satisfied in\nlarge-n clusters, i.e. n ~ 30,000 (we argue, however, that the density of the\nArches cluster is insufficient for us to expect stellar collisions to have\noccurred in the cluster's prior evolution). We find that the character of the\ncollision process is not such that it is a route toward smoothly filling the\ntop end of the mass spectrum. Instead, runaway growth of one or two extreme\nobjects can occur within less than 1 Myr after accretion is shut off, resulting\nin a few objects with masses several times the maximum reached by accretion.\nThe rapid formation of these objects is due to not just the post-formation\ndynamical evolution of the clusters, but an interplay of dynamics and the\naccretional growth of the stars. We find that accretion-driven cluster\nshrinkage results in a distribution of gas and stars that offsets the\ndisruptive effect of gas expulsion, and we propose that the process can lead to\nmassive binaries and early mass segregation in star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 21:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 13:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

To\nfind water masers at much higher redshifts, we have begun a survey of known\ngravitationally lensed quasars and star-forming galaxies. In this paper, we\npresent a search for 22 GHz (rest frame) water masers toward five dusty,\ngravitationally lensed quasars and star-forming galaxies at redshifts 2.3--2.9\nwith the Effelsberg telescope and the EVLA.

The goal\nof this paper is to understand and characterize the impact of social influence\non the complexity of computing and approximating market equilibria.\n  We present complexity-theoretic and algorithmic results for approximating\nmarket equilibria in this model with focus on two concrete influence models\nbased on the traditional linear utility functions. Recall that an Arrow-Debreu\nmarket equilibrium in a conventional exchange market with linear utility\nfunctions can be computed in polynomial time by convex programming.

The sudden drop in Tc is ascribed to this structural tran-sition, by\nwhich an enhancement in Tc due to a strong electron-rattler interaction present\nin the low-pressure cubic phase is abrogated as the rattling of the K ion is\ncompletely suppressed or weakened in the high-pressure phase of reduced\nsymmetry. In addition, we find two anomalies in the temperature dependence of\nresistivity in the low-pressure phase, which may be due to subtle changes in\nrattling vibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 08:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In the first paper of this series we estimate\nthe gravitational potential and we give it in a form suitable to be used in\ndynamical studies. The estimation is done directly from near-infrared\nobservations. Since the 3D distribution of the luminous matter is unknown, we\nconstruct three different general models for the potential corresponding to\nthree different assumptions for the geometry of the system, representing\nlimiting cases. A pure 2D disc, a cylindrical geometry (thick disc) and a third\ncase, where a spherical geometry is assumed to apply for the major part of the\nbar. For the potential of the disc component on the galactic plane a Fourier\ndecomposition method is used, that allows us to express it as a sum of\ntrigonometric terms. Both even and odd components are considered, so that the\nestimated potential accounts also for the observed asymmetries in the\nmorphology. For the amplitudes of the trigonometric terms a smoothed cubic\ninterpolation scheme is used. The total potential in each model may include two\nadditional terms (Plummer spheres) representing a central mass concentration\nand a dark halo component, respectively. In all examined models, the relative\nforce perturbation points to a strongly nonlinear gravitational field, which\nranges from 0.45 to 0.8 of the axisymmetric background with the pure 2D being\nthe most nonlinear one. We present the topological distributions of the stable\nand unstable Lagrangian points as a function of the pattern speed $(\\Omega_p)$.\nIn all three models there is a range of $\\Omega_p$ values, where we find\nmultiple stationary points whose stability affects the overall dynamics of the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 10:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In reality, wireless communication channels in MANETs are an\nerror-prone and suffer from high packet-loss due to presence of noise, i.e.,\nnoisy environment. In this paper, we propose a simulation model that can be\nused to evaluate the performance of probabilistic broadcast for flooding in\nnoisy environment. In the proposed model, the noise-level is represented by a\ngeneric name, probability of reception (pc) (0<=pc<=1), where pc=1 for\nnoiseless and <1 for noisy environment. The effect of noise is determined\nrandomly by generating a random number \\zeta (0<=\\zeta<1); if \\zeta<=pc means\nthe packet is successfully delivered to the receiving node, otherwise,\nunsuccessful delivery occurs. The proposed model is implemented on a MANET\nsimulator, namely, MANSim. The effect of noise on the performance of\nprobabilistic algorithm was investigated in four scenarios. The main\nconclusions of these scenarios are: the performance of probabilistic algorithm\nsuffers in presence of noise. However, this suffering is less in high density\nnetworks, or if the nodes characterized by high retransmission probability or\nlarge radio transmission range. The nodes' speed has no or insignificant effect\non the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 10:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-03"}

A recent study showed\nthat an extension of Uhrig's dynamical decoupling (UDD) sequence can (in\ntheory) lock an arbitrary but known two-qubit entangled state to the $N$th\norder using a sequence of $N$ control pulses [Mukhtar et al., Phys.

It is found that the obtained decoherence\nsuppression can be highly sensitive to the ordering of the three UDD layers and\ncan be remarkably effective with the correct ordering. The detailed theoretical\nresults are useful for general understanding of the nature of controlled\nquantum dynamics under nested UDD. As an extension of our three-layer UDD, it\nis finally pointed out that a completely unknown two-qubit state can be\nprotected by nesting four layers of UDD sequences.

This is a\nnearest neighbor non-Markovian random walk in Z^d which prefers to jump to\nthose neighbors which were less visited in the past. The self-repelling\nBrownian polymer model (SRBP), initiated in the probabilistic literature by\nDurrett and Rogers (independently of the physics community), is the continuous\nspace-time counterpart: a diffusion in R^d pushed by the negative gradient of\nthe (mollified) occupation time measure of the process. In both cases, similar\nlong memory effects are caused by a pathwise self-repellency of the\ntrajectories due to a push by the negative gradient of (softened) local time.\nWe investigate the asymptotic behaviour of TSAW and SRBP in the non-recurrent\ndimensions. First, we identify a natural stationary (in time) and ergodic\ndistribution of the environment (the local time profile) as seen from the\nmoving particle. The main results are diffusive limits. In the case of TSAW,\nfor a wide class of self-interaction functions, we establish diffusive lower\nand upper bounds for the displacement and for a particular, more restricted\nclass of interactions, we prove full CLT for the finite dimensional\ndistributions of the displacement. In the case of SRBP, we prove full CLT\nwithout restrictions on the interaction functions. These results settle part of\nthe conjectures, based on non-rigorous renormalization group arguments (equally\n'valid' for the TSAW and SRBP cases). The proof of the CLT follows the\nnon-reversible version of Kipnis-Varadhan theory. On the way to the proof, we\nslightly weaken the so-called graded sector condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 12:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

Our main result is the discovery of three new\ndynamical mechanisms that can support structures in a barred-spiral grand\ndesign system. These mechanisms are presented in characteristic cases, where\nthese dynamical phenomena take place. They refer firstly to the support of a\nstrong bar, of ansae type, almost solely by chaotic orbits, then to the support\nof spirals by chaotic orbits that for a certain number of pat tern revolutions\nfollow an n:1 (n=7,8) morphology, and finally to the support of spiral arms by\na combination of orbits trapped around L$_{4,5}$ and sticky chaotic orbits with\nthe same Jacobi constant.

Our convergence results hold with no semismoothness\nassumption, which is illustrated by examples. The algorithm and main results\nobtained in the paper are compared with well-recognized semismooth and\n$B$-differentiable versions of Newton's method for nonsmooth Lipschitzian\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 12:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-03"}

For certain lattice parameters and electromagnetic wave\nfrequencies, islands of stable orbits act as a dynamical barrier, which\nseparates the chaotic trajectories into two distinct regions of the crystal,\nthereby preventing the rays propagating through the structure. We show that\nchanging the frequency of the light strongly affects the distribution of stable\nand unstable orbits in both real and phase space.

In such a scenario nitrous oxide displays prominent spectral\nfeatures, so may be more important as a biomarker than previously considered in\nsuch cases.

Although no optical counterpart is known for\nMM18423+5938, we were able to measure the redshift z=3.92960 +/- 0.00013 from\nthe detection of CO lines using the IRAM Eight MIxer Receiver (EMIR). In\naddition, by collecting all available photometric data in the far-infrared and\nradio to constrain its spectral energy distribution, we derive the FIR\nluminosity 4.8 10^14/m Lsol and mass 6.0 10^9/m Msol for its dust, allowing for\na magnification factor m caused by a probable gravitational lens. The\ncorresponding star-formation rate is 8.3 10^4/m Msol/yr. The detection of three\nlines of the CO rotational ladder, and a significant upper limit for a fourth\nCO line, allow us to estimate an H2 mass of between 1.9 10^11/m Msol and 1.1\n10^12/m Msol. The two lines CI(3p1-3p0) and CI(3p2-3p1) were clearly detected\nand yield a [CI]/[H2] number abundance between 1.4 10^-5 and 8.0 10^-5. Upper\nlimits are presented for emission lines of HCN, HCO^+, HNC, H_2O and other\nmolecules observed. The moderate excitation of the CO lines is indicative of an\nextended starburst, and excludes the dominance of an AGN in heating this\nhigh-redshift SMG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 15:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 23:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

How this\ncollective period is established is a key question in understanding biological\nclocks. We explore this question in the segmentation clock, a population of\ncoupled cellular oscillators in the vertebrate embryo that sets the rhythm of\nsomitogenesis, the morphological segmentation of the body axis. The oscillating\ncells of the zebrafish segmentation clock are thought to possess noisy\nautonomous periods, which are synchronized by intercellular coupling through\nthe Delta-Notch pathway. Here we ask whether Delta-Notch coupling additionally\ninfluences the collective period of the segmentation clock. Using\nmultiple-embryo time-lapse microscopy, we show that disruption of Delta-Notch\nintercellular coupling increases the period of zebrafish somitogenesis.\nEmbryonic segment length and the spatial wavelength of oscillating gene\nexpression also increase correspondingly, indicating an increase in the\nsegmentation clock's period. Using a theory based on phase oscillators in which\nthe collective period self-organizes because of time delays in coupling, we\nestimate the cell-autonomous period, the coupling strength, and the coupling\ndelay from our data. Further supporting the role of coupling delays in the\nclock, we predict and experimentally confirm an instability resulting from\ndecreased coupling delay time. Synchronization of cells by Delta-Notch coupling\nregulates the collective period of the segmentation clock. Our identification\nof the first segmentation clock period mutants is a critical step toward a\nmolecular understanding of temporal control in this system. We propose that\ncollective control of period via delayed coupling may be a general feature of\nbiological clocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 15:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-03"}

In particular, this framework does not\nimplicitly impose inappropriate assumptions, nor does it repudiate relevant\ninformation. Although OUQ optimization problems are extremely large, we show\nthat under general conditions they have finite-dimensional reductions. As an\napplication, we develop \\emph{Optimal Concentration Inequalities} (OCI) of\nHoeffding and McDiarmid type.
