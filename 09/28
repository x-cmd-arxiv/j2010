The modeled relative\nnumbers of radio-detected and radio-quiet objects agree well with the data.\nAlthough the sample is local, extrapolation to the full Galaxy implies a\ngamma-ray pulsar birthrate 1/(59 yr). This is shown to be in good agreement\nwith the estimated Galactic core collapse rate and with the local density of OB\nstar progenitors. We give predictions for the numbers of expected young pulsar\ndetections if Fermi LAT observations continue 10 years.

This is a key point in order to complete the\nproper definition of these theories and, what is very important, to study their\npossible phenomenological implications. As is well known, in\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity the breakdown of Lorentz invariance invalidates the\nusual notion of minimally coupled matter. Two different approaches to bypass\nthis problem are here described. One is based on a Kaluza-Klein\nreinterpretation of the 3+1 decomposition of the gravity degrees of freedom,\nwhat naturally leads to a definition of a U(1) gauge symmetry and, hence, to a\nnew type of minimal coupling. The other approach relies on a midi-superspace\nformalism and the subsequent parametrization of the matter stress-energy tensor\nin terms of deep infrared variables. Using the last option, the phase space of\nthe Horava-Lifshitz cosmology in the presence of general matter couplings is\nstudied.

Here we show that by subjecting each electron spin to\na magnetic field of different magnitude we achieve full quantum control of the\ntwo-electron logical spin qubit with nanosecond operation times. Using a single\ndevice, a magnetic field gradient of several hundred milliTesla is generated\nand sustained using dynamic nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As\nnuclei. Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using\nquantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single\nand potentially multiple qubit operations with gate times that approach the\nthreshold required for quantum error correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 17:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}

The cultures are modeled as\nrandom graphs, whose nodes are excitatory neurons with kin inputs and kout\noutputs, and whose input degrees kin = k obey given distribution functions pk.\nWe examine the firing activity of the population of neurons according to their\ninput degree (k) classes and calculate for each class its firing probability\n\\Phi_k(t) as a function of t. The probability of a node to fire is found to be\ndetermined by its in-degree k, and the first-to-fire neurons are those that\nhave a high k. A small minority of high-k classes may be called \"Leaders\", as\nthey form an inter-connected subnetwork that consistently fires much before the\nrest of the culture. Once initiated, the activity spreads from the Leaders to\nthe less connected majority of the culture. We then use the distribution of\nin-degree of the Leaders to study the growth rate of the number of neurons\nactive in a burst, which was experimentally measured to be initially\nexponential. We find that this kind of growth rate is best described by a\npopulation that has an in-degree distribution that is a Gaussian centered\naround k = 75 with width {\\sigma} = 31 for the majority of the neurons, but\nalso has a power law tail with exponent -2 for ten percent of the population.\nNeurons in the tail may have as many as k = 4, 700 inputs.

It is found, contrary to the today\naccepted Physics knowledge, that a body's Rest Mass measures its Potential\nEnergy in the 1905 context. After emphasizing the difference between 1905\nRelativity (1905R) and Special Relativity (SR), the developing of a 1905R\nrelativistic gravity is started for a small mass m material point moving in the\ncentral gravitational field of a great mass M one. A formula for the rest mass\nm_0 as a function of its distance r from M is obtained. Finally, those results\nare applied to an atomic clock in a gravitational field, reaching a factor to\nobtain the clock time rate change very close to the GR one. The factors from\n1905R and GR are compared, emphasizing the absent of a singularity in 1905R. In\nthe conclusions, a new road for the development of a 1905R relativistic\nmechanics is declared, related with the discovery that Rest Mass measures\nPotential Energy, done by 1905 Einstein even if not realizing it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 19:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}

The most common way to compute the change in\norbital period during a CE is to relate the binding energy of the envelope of\nthe Roche-lobe filling giant to the change in orbital energy. Especially in\npopulation-synthesis codes, where the evolution of millions of stars must be\ncomputed and detailed evolutionary models are too expensive computationally,\nsimple approximations are made for the envelope binding energy. In this study,\nwe present accurate analytic prescriptions based on detailed stellar-evolution\nmodels that provide the envelope binding energy for giants with metallicities\nbetween Z = 10-4 and Z = 0.03 and masses between 0.8 Msun and 100 Msun, as a\nfunction of the metallicity, mass, radius and evolutionary phase of the star.\nOur results are also presented in the form of electronic data tables and\nFortran routines that use them. We find that the accuracy of our fits is better\nthan 15% for 90% of our model data points in all cases, and better than 10% for\n90% of our data points in all cases except the asymptotic giant branches for\nthree of the six metallicities we consider. For very massive stars (M > 50\nMsun), when stars lose more than ~20% of their initial mass due to stellar\nwinds, our fits do not describe the models as accurately. Our results are more\nwidely applicable - covering wider ranges of metallicity and mass - and are of\nhigher accuracy than those of previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 21:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Since the introduction of advertisements\nor subscription fees will be construed by users as an inconvenience which may\nlead them to stop using the site, what should the provider do in order to\nmaximize revenues? We address this question through the lens of adaptation\ntheory, which states that even though a change affects a person's utility\ninitially, as time goes on people tend to adapt and become less aware of past\nchanges. We establish that if the likelihood of continuing to attend to the\nprovider after an increase in inconvenience is log-concave in the magnitude of\nthe increase, then the provider faces a tradeoff between achieving a higher\nrevenue per user sooner and maximizing the number of users in the long term. On\nthe other hand, if the likelihood of continuing to attend to the provider after\nan increase in inconvenience is log-convex, then it is always optimal for the\nprovider to perform the increase in one step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 21:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

These\nstudies are highly useful for investigating both the early star formation\nhistory of galaxies and the sources of cosmic re-ionization. In order to better\nunderstand these issues, we carefully examine if there are low-$z$ interlopers\nin the samples of z~8 galaxy candidates. We focus on the strong emission-line\ngalaxies at z~2 in this paper. Such galaxies may be selected as Y_105-dropouts\nsince the [OIII] lambda 5007 emission line is redshifted into the J_125-band.\nWe have found that the contamination from such low-$z$ interlopers is\nnegligibly small. Therefore, all objects found by the five groups are free from\nthis type of contamination. However, it remains difficult to extract real z~8\ngalaxies because all the sources are very faint and the different groups have\nfound different candidates. With this in mind, we construct a robust sample of\neight galaxies at z~8 from the objects found by the five groups: each of these\neight objects has been selected by at least two groups. Using this sample, we\ndiscuss their UV continuum slope. We also discuss the escape fraction of\nionizing photons adopting various metallicities. Our analysis suggests that\nmassive stars forming in low-metallicity gas (Z~5 \\times 10^-4 Z_sun) can be\nresponsible for the completion of cosmic re-ionization if the escape fraction\nof ionizing continuum from galaxies is as large as 0.5, and this is consistent\nwith the observed blue UV continua.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 04:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 09:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Therefore, it is vital to calculate the spin temperature\nself-consistently by treating the Lyman-alpha and collisional coupling of spin\ntemperature to the kinetic temperature. In this paper we develop an extension\nto the BEARS algorithm, originally developed to model reionization history, to\ninclude these coupling effects. Here we simulate the effect in ionization and\nheating for three models in which the reionization is driven by stars, miniqsos\nor a mixture of both.We also perform a number of statistical tests to quantify\nthe imprint of the self-consistent inclusion of the spin temperature decoupling\nfrom the CMB.

(2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we\ncollected times of superhump maxima for 61 SU UMa-type dwarf novae mainly\nobserved during the 2009-2010 season. The newly obtained data confirmed the\nbasic findings reported in Kato et al. (2009): the presence of stages A-C, as\nwell as the predominance of positive period derivatives during stage B in\nsystems with superhump periods shorter than 0.07 d. There was a systematic\ndifference in period derivatives for systems with superhump periods longer than\n0.075 d between this study and Kato et al. (2009). We suggest that this\ndifference is possibly caused by the relative lack of frequently outbursting SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae in this period regime in the present study. We recorded a\nstrong beat phenomenon during the 2009 superoutburst of IY UMa. The close\ncorrelation between the beat period and superhump period suggests that the\nchanging angular velocity of the apsidal motion of the elliptical disk is\nresponsible for the variation of superhump periods. We also described three new\nWZ Sge-type objects with established early superhumps and one with likely early\nsuperhumps. We also suggest that two systems, VX For and EL UMa, are WZ\nSge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings. The O-C variation in OT\nJ213806.6+261957 suggests that the frequent absence of rebrightenings in very\nshort-Porb objects can be a result of sustained superoutburst plateau at the\nepoch when usual SU UMa-type dwarf novae return to quiescence preceding a\nrebrightening.

Large-scale\nspatial variations of the magnetic field has been shown to be important in\nunderstanding observations. The effects are complex, so here we consider a\nsimple, illustrative model. Here, we solve numerically the Parker transport\nequation for a shock in the presence of large-scale sinusoidal magnetic-field\nvariations. We demonstrate that the familiar planar-shock results can be\nsignificantly altered as a consequence of large-scale, meandering magnetic\nlines of force. Because perpendicular diffusion coefficient $\\kappa_\\perp$ is\ngenerally much smaller than parallel diffusion coefficient $\\kappa_\\parallel$,\nthe energetic charged particles are trapped and preferentially accelerated\nalong the shock front in the regions where the connection points of magnetic\nfield lines intersecting the shock surface converge, and thus create the \"hot\nspots\" of the accelerated particles. For the regions where the connection\npoints separate from each other, the acceleration to high energies will be\nsuppressed. Further, the particles diffuse away from the \"hot spot\" regions and\nmodify the spectra of downstream particle distribution. These features are\nqualitatively similar to the recent Voyager's observation in the Heliosheath.\nThese results are potentially important for particle acceleration at shocks\npropagating in turbulent magnetized plasmas as well as those which contain\nlarge-scale nonplanar structures.

This simple test is\ncomplicated by the fact that Lyman-alpha emission can also be affected by the\nevolving astrophysical details of the host galaxies. In the first paper in this\nseries, we demonstrated both a luminosity and redshift dependent trend in the\nfraction of Lyman-alpha emitters seen within color-selected Lyman-break\ngalaxies (LBGs) over the range 3<z<6; lower luminosity galaxies and those at\nhigher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission.

We find 54+/-11% of faint z~6 LBGs show strong (W_0>25\nA) emission, an increase of 1.6x from a similar sample observed at z~4. With a\ntotal sample of 74 z~6 LBGs, we determine the luminosity-dependent Lyman-alpha\nequivalent width distribution. Assuming continuity in these trends to the new\npopulation of z~7 sources located with the Hubble WFC3/IR camera, we predict\nthat unless the neutral fraction rises in the intervening 200 Myr, the success\nrate for spectroscopic confirmation using Lyman-alpha emission should be high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 07:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The state-counting is then\ntransparent, and the gauge is suited for studies of the excited spectrum.\nLeaving aside exotic spectroscopy, which has been the subject of other\npublications, in this note I call attention on two recent applications. One is\nthat the running quark mass in the mid-infrared can be probed from excited\nbaryons thanks to parity doubling, a consequence of insensitivity to chiral\nsymmetry breaking. Fast quarks are asymptotically free and behave as massless,\nso hadrons containing fast quarks decouple from the condensate. Their\n(power-law) rate of decoupling reflects on the rate of decreasing parity\nsplittings, which can be measured. The second is that, in analogy with the\nFranck-Condon principle of molecular physics, the velocity distribution of the\nheavy quarks inside a heavy hadron can be mapped out by the velocity\ndistribution of its open-flavor decay products. This is exemplified by recent\ndata from the Belle collaboration taken at the Upsilon(10860).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 08:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

We derive\nexpressions for average values of output state observables in particular\ncumulants which are additive in terms of the input state and the resource of\nteleportation. Working with Squeezed Bell-like states, which may be optimized\nin a free parameter for better teleportation performance we discuss the\nrelation between resources optimal for fidelity and for different observable\naverages. We obtain the values of the free parameter which optimize the central\nmomenta and cumulants up to fourth order. For the cumulants the distortion\nbetween in and out states due to teleportation depends only on the resource. We\nobtain optimal parameters for the second and fourth order cumulants which do\nnot depend on the squeezing of the resource. The second order central momenta\nwhich is equal to the second order cumulants and the photon number average are\noptimized by the same resource. We show that the optimal fidelity resource,\nfound in reference (Phys. Rev.

A similar behavior is obtained for the\nresource which optimizes the photon statistics which is treated here using the\nsum of the squared differences in photon probabilities of input and output\nstates as the distortion measure. This is interpreted to mean that the\ndistortions associated to second order momenta dominates the behavior of the\noutput state for large squeezing of the resource. Optimal fidelity and optimal\nphoton statistics resources are compared and is shown that for mixtures of Fock\nstates they are equivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 09:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Current models suggest that this is the first transiting\nrocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the planet orbits a\nsolar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material\nreleased from its surface may then form an exosphere. AIMS: We constrai n the\nproperties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit.\nDetecting of the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow to study\nthe material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan\nthe entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing\nparticularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury, and Io in our\nsolar system. METHODS: Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to\nbe narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By\nsubtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and\nabsorption lines originating in the exosph ere of CoRoT-7b.

Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as\n300, we derive firm upper limits for the flux-range between 1.6E-18 and 3.2E-18\nWm**-2. For CaO, we find an upper limit of E-17 Wm**-2. We also search for\nemission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by volcanic activity and\nderive upper limits for these lines.

However, the high turbidity of foams generally\nhinders the detailed study of the temporal and spatial distribution of\nrearrangement events, such that definite assessments regarding their\ncontribution to the overall dynamics could not be made so far. In this paper,\nwe use novel light scattering techniques to measure the frequency and position\nof events within a large sample volume. As recently reported (A. S. Gittings\nand D. J. Durian, Phys. Rev. E, 2008, 78, 066313), we find that the foam\ndynamics is determined by two distinct processes: intermittent bubble\nrearrangements of finite duration and a spatially homogeneous quasicontinuous\nprocess. Our experiments show that the convolution of these two processes\ndetermines the age-dependence of the mean dynamics, such that relations between\nintermittent rearrangements and coarsening process can not be established by\nconsidering means. By contrast the use of the recently introduced photon\ncorrelation imaging technique (A. Duri, D. A. Sessoms, V. Trappe, and L.\nCipelletti, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2009, 102, 085702) enables us to assess that the\nevent frequency is directly determined by the strain-rate imposed by the\ncoarsening process. Surprisingly, we also find that, although the distribution\nof successive events in time is consistent with a random process, the spatial\ndistribution of successive events is not random: rearrangements are more likely\nto occur within a recently rearranged zone. This implies that a topological\nrearrangement is likely to lead to an unstable configuration, such that a small\namount of coarsening-induced strain is sufficient to trigger another event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 13:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-29"}

Indeed, though the set\nof all unit norm tight frames, modulo rotations, is known to contain manifolds\nof nontrivial dimension, we have but a small finite number of known\nconstructions of such frames.

In the special case where the number of frame elements is relatively\nprime to the dimension of the underlying space, we show that this algorithm\nconverges to a unit norm tight frame at a linear rate, provided the initial\nunit norm frame is already sufficiently close to being tight. By slightly\nmodifying this approach, we get a similar, but weaker, result in the\nnon-relatively-prime case, providing an explicit answer to the Paulsen problem:\n\"How close is a frame which is almost tight and almost unit norm to some unit\nnorm tight frame?\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 13:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-29"}

The small dispersion in polarization\nangle could be due to the presence of uniform dust layer beyond 1 kpc. Present\nobservations reveal that in case of NGC 1893, the foreground two dust layers,\nin addition to the intracluster medium, seems to be responsible for the\npolarization effects. It is also found that towards the direction of NGC 1893,\nthe dust layer that exists between 2-3 kpc has a negligible contribution\ntowards the total observed polarization.

These complexities include the following. First, the images\nthemselves are of no interest: all interest focuses on the behavior of\nindividual cells across time, and thus, the cells need to be segmented in an\nautomated manner. Second, the cells themselves have 100$+$ pixels, so that they\nform 100$+$ curves measured over time, so that data compression is required to\nextract the features of these curves. Third, some of the pixels in some of the\ncells are subject to image saturation due to bit depth limits, and this\nsaturation needs to be accounted for if one is to normalize the images in a\nreasonably unbiased manner. Finally, the $\\mathrm {Ca}^{2+}$ signals have\noscillations or waves that vary with time and these signals need to be\nextracted. Thus, our aim is to show how to use multiple weighted and standard\nsingular value decompositions to detect, extract and clarify the $\\mathrm\n{Ca}^{2+}$ signals. Our signal extraction methods then lead to simple although\nfinely focused statistical methods to compare $\\mathrm {Ca}^{2+}$ signals\nacross experimental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 09:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-30"}
