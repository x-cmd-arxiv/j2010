Standard numerical methods such as the finite element method (FEM)\nscale with the local wavelength and quickly become too large even for modern\ncomputer architectures. High frequency techniques, such as statistical energy\nanalysis (SEA), often miss important information such as dominant resonance\nbehaviour due to stiff or small scale parts of the structure. Hybrid methods\ncircumvent this problem by coupling FEM/BEM and SEA models in a given built-up\nstructure. In the approach adopted here, the whole system is split into a\nnumber of subsystems which are treated by either FEM or SEA depending on the\nlocal wavelength.

We find that using a common\nenvelope parameterization employing energy balance with alpha=1 and lambda=1,\nthe supernova rates per unit mass (born in stars) of sub-Chandrasekhar mass SNe\nIa exceed those of all other progenitor channels at epochs t=0.7 - 4 Gyr for a\nburst of star formation at t=0. Additionally, the delay time distribution of\nthe sub-Chandrasekhar model can be divided in to two distinct evolutionary\nchannels: the `prompt' helium-star channel with delay times < 500 Myr, and the\n`delayed' double white dwarf channel with delay times > 800 Myr spanning up to\na Hubble time. These findings are in agreement with recent\nobservationally-derived delay time distributions which predict that a large\nnumber of SNe Ia have delay times < 1 Gyr, with a significant fraction having\ndelay times < 500 Myr. We find that the DDS channel is also able to account for\nthe observed rates of SNe Ia.

Scientists are\nincreasingly interested in viewing the latest data as part of query results.\nCurrent scientific middleware cache systems, however, assume repositories are\nstatic. Thus, they cannot answer scientific queries with the latest data. The\nqueries, instead, are routed to the repository until data at the cache is\nrefreshed. In data-intensive scientific disciplines, such as astronomy,\nindiscriminate query routing or data refreshing often results in runaway\nnetwork costs. This severely affects the performance and scalability of the\nrepositories and makes poor use of the cache system. We present Delta, a\ndynamic data middleware cache system for rapidly-growing scientific\nrepositories. Delta's key component is a decision framework that adaptively\ndecouples data objects---choosing to keep some data object at the cache, when\nthey are heavily queried, and keeping some data objects at the repository, when\nthey are heavily updated. Our algorithm profiles incoming workload to search\nfor optimal data decoupling that reduces network costs. It leverages formal\nconcepts from the network flow problem, and is robust to evolving scientific\nworkloads. We evaluate the efficacy of Delta, through a prototype\nimplementation, by running query traces collected from a real astronomy survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2010 22:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

Recent experiments, probing the mixing capability of\nunicellular biflagellates, revealed that passive tracer particles exhibit\nanomalous non-Gaussian diffusion when immersed in a dilute suspension of\nself-motile Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae. Qualitatively, this observation\ncan be explained by the fact that the algae induce a fluid flow that may\noccasionally accelerate the colloidal tracers to relatively large velocities. A\nsatisfactory quantitative theory of enhanced mixing in dilute active\nsuspensions, however, is lacking at present. In particular, it is unclear how\nnon-Gaussian signatures in the tracers' position distribution are linked to the\nself-propulsion mechanism of a microorganism. Here, we develop a systematic\ntheoretical description of anomalous tracer diffusion in active suspensions,\nbased on a simplified tracer-swimmer interaction model that captures the\ntypical distance scaling of a microswimmer's flow field. We show that the\nexperimentally observed non-Gaussian tails are generic and arise due to a\ncombination of truncated L\\'evy statistics for the velocity field and\nalgebraically decaying time correlations in the fluid. Our analytical\nconsiderations are illustrated through extensive simulations, implemented on\ngraphics processing units to achieve the large sample sizes required for\nanalyzing the tails of the tracer distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 06:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

A series of models for rapidly rotating\n($P_{rot} = 1$ day) stars of different masses and compositions is generated.\nThe effective temperature is found convenient to parameterize the differential\nrotation: variations with metallicity, that are quite pronounced when the\ndifferential rotation is considered as a function of the stellar mass, almost\ndisappear in the dependence of differential rotation on temperature. The\ndifferential rotation increases steadily with surface temperature to exceed the\nlargest differential rotation observed to date for the hottest F-stars we\nconsidered. This strong differential rotation is, however, found not to be\nefficient for dynamos when the efficiency is estimated with the standard\n$C_\\Omega$-parameter of dynamo models. On the contrary, the small differential\nrotation of M-stars is the most dynamo-efficient. The meridional flow near the\nbottom of the convection zone is not small compared to the flow at the top in\nall our computations. The flow is distributed over the entire convection zone\nin slow rotators but retreats to the convection zone boundaries with increasing\nrotation rate, to consist of two near-boundary jets in rapid rotators.

In MEH-PPV, by increasing the extent of conjugation\nfrom 30 to 100 %, the persistence length (l_p) increases from 20 to 66\nAngstrom. Moreover, a pronounced second peak in the pair distribution function\nhas been observed in fully conjugated chain, at larger length scales.

We find that the extent\nof the redshift range over which surveys are unbiased is a function of the\nwavelength of selection, flux density limit and ULIRG luminosity. Short\nwavelength (<200{\\mu}m) surveys with IRAS, Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS are\nsensitive to all SED types in a large temperature interval (17-87K), over a\nsubstantial fraction of their accessible redshift range.

We evaluate observations in the context of survey selection\neffects, finding that the lack of cold ULIRGs in the local (z<0.1) Universe is\nnot a consequence of selection and that the range of ULIRG temperatures seen\nlocally is only a subset of a much larger range which exists at high redshift.\nWe demonstrate that the local luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, which\nindicates that more luminous sources are also hotter, is not applicable in the\ndistant Universe when extrapolated to the ULIRG regime, because the scatter in\nobserved temperatures is too large. Finally, we show that the difference\nbetween the ULIRG temperature distributions locally and at high redshift is not\nthe result of galaxies becoming colder due to an L-T relation which evolves as\na function of redshift. Instead, they are consistent with a picture where the\nevolution of the infrared luminosity function is temperature dependent, i.e.\ncold galaxies evolve at a faster rate than their warm counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 11:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The rate at which the signal is revealed to the\nmarket then determines the overall magnitude of asset volatility. By letting\nthis information flow rate random, we obtain an elementary stochastic\nvolatility model within the information-based approach. Such an extension is\neconomically justified on account of the fact that in real markets information\nflow rates are rarely measurable. Effects of having a random information flow\nrate is investigated in detail in the context of a simple model setup.\nSpecifically, the price process of the asset is derived, and its characteristic\nbehaviours are revealed via simulation studies. The price of a European-style\noption is worked out, showing that the model has a sufficient flexibility to\nfit volatility surface. As an extension of the random information flow model,\nprice manipulation is considered.

Then we show that finite dimensional compact\nconnected nilspaces are nilmanifolds. The theory of compact nilspaces is a\ngeneralization of the theory of compact abelian groups. This paper is the main\nalgebraic tool in the second authors approach to Gowers's uniformity norms and\nhigher order Fourier analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 14:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2011 14:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2012 18:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

These SNe are faint (absolute peak\nmagnitude of ~ -15) and fast SNe that show unique composition. They are\ninferred to have low ejecta mass (a few tenths of a solar mass) and to be\nhighly enriched in calcium, but poor in silicon elements and nickel. These SNe\nwere therefore suggested to belong to a new class of calcium-rich faint SNe\nexplosions. Their properties were proposed to be the result of helium\ndetonations that may occur on helium accreting white dwarfs. In this paper we\ntheoretically study the scenario of helium detonations, and focus on the\nresults of detonations in accreted helium layers on low mass carbon-oxygen (CO)\ncores. We present new results from one dimensional simulations of such\nexplosions, including their light curves and spectra. We find that when the\ndensity of the helium layer is low enough the helium detonation produces large\namounts of intermediate elements, such as calcium and titanium, together with a\nlarge amount of unburnt helium. Our results suggest that the properties of\ncalcium-rich faint SNe could indeed be consistent with the helium-detonation\nscenario on small CO cores. Above a certain density (larger CO cores) the\ndetonation leaves mainly 56Ni and unburnt helium, and the predicted spectrum\nwill unlikely fit the unique features of this class of SNe. Finally, none of\nour studied models reproduces the bright, fast evolving light curves of another\ntype of peculiar SNe suggested to originate in helium detonations (SNe 1885A,\n1939B and 2002bj).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 14:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The aim\nof this work is to derive the physical conditions pertaining to the warm\nmolecular gas and study their variations within the flow. The mid-IR H2\nemission follows the morphology of the precessing flow, with peaks correlated\nwith individual CO clumps and H2 2.12{\\mu}m ro-vibrational emission. More\ndiffuse emission delineating the CO cavities is detected only in the low-laying\ntransitions, with J(lower) less or equal to 2. The H2 line images have been\nused to construct 2D maps of N(H2), H2 ortho-to-para ratio and temperature\nspectral index beta, in the assumption of a gas temperature stratification\nwhere the H2 column density varies as T^(beta). Variations of these parameters\nare observed along the flow. In particular, the ortho-to-para ratio ranges from\n0.6 to 2.8, highlighting the presence of regions subject to recent shocks where\nthe ortho-to-para ratio has not had time yet to reach the equilibrium value.\nNear-IR spectroscopic data on ro-vibrational H2 emission have been combined\nwith the mid-IR data and used to derive additional shock parameters in the\nbrightest blue- and red-shifted emission knots. A high abundance of atomic\nhydrogen (H/H2 about 0.1-0.3) is implied by the observed H2 column densities,\nassuming n(H2) values as derived by independent SiO observations. The presence\nof a high fraction of atomic hydrogen, indicates that a partially-dissociative\nshock component should be considered for the H2 excitation in these localized\nregions. However, planar shock models, either of C- or J-type, are not able to\nconsistently reproduce all the physical parameters derived from our analysis of\nthe H2 emission. Globally, H2 emission contributes to about 50% of the total\nshock radiated energy in the L1157 outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 14:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The ideas of Euler and later those of Riemann, Ramanujan and of\nother, less popular, mathematicians have therefore provided the mathematical\napparatus ideally suited to explore, and eventually solve, problems of\nfundamental importance in modern Physics. The mathematical foundations of the\ntheory of renormalization trace back to the work on divergent series by Euler\nand by mathematicians of two centuries ago. Feynman, Dyson, Schwinger...\nrediscovered most of these mathematical \"curiosities\" and were able to develop\na new and powerful way of looking at physical phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 12:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}
