More precisely,\nfor any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem R_S such that, if C\nis any \"reasonable\" complexity class, then R_S is in the search version of C if\nand only if S is in the sampling version. As one application, we show that\nSampP=SampBQP if and only if FBPP=FBQP: in other words, classical computers can\nefficiently sample the output distribution of every quantum circuit, if and\nonly if they can efficiently solve every search problem that quantum computers\ncan solve.

With perfect knowledge of channel states, the base stations\ncan adjust their transmissions for achieving a network-wise QoS optimality. In\npractice, however, the CSI can be obtained only imperfectly. As a result, due\nto the uncertainties involved, the network is not guaranteed to benefit from a\nglobally optimal QoS. Nevertheless, if the channel estimation perturbations are\nconfined within bounded regions, the QoS measure will also lie within a bounded\nregion. Therefore, by exploiting the notion of robustness in the worst-case\nsense some worst-case QoS guarantees for the network can be asserted. We adopt\na popular model for noisy channel estimates that assumes that estimation noise\nterms lie within known hyper-spheres.

The last\ncentury saw several significant fundamental advances in our understanding of\nthe process of inference, which make it clear that these are inferential\ntheories. That is, rather than being a description of the behavior of the\nuniverse, these theories describe how observers can make optimal predictions\nabout the universe. In such a picture, information plays a critical role. What\nis more is that little clues, such as the fact that black holes have entropy,\ncontinue to suggest that information is fundamental to physics in general.\n  In the last decade, our fundamental understanding of probability theory has\nled to a Bayesian revolution. In addition, we have come to recognize that the\nfoundations go far deeper and that Cox's approach of generalizing a Boolean\nalgebra to a probability calculus is the first specific example of the more\nfundamental idea of assigning valuations to partially-ordered sets. By\nconsidering this as a natural way to introduce quantification to the more\nfundamental notion of ordering, one obtains an entirely new way of deriving\nphysical laws. I will introduce this new way of thinking by demonstrating how\none can quantify partially-ordered sets and, in the process, derive physical\nlaws. The implication is that physical law does not reflect the order in the\nuniverse, instead it is derived from the order imposed by our description of\nthe universe. Information physics, which is based on understanding the ways in\nwhich we both quantify and process information about the world around us, is a\nfundamentally new approach to science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 05:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In\nthe industrial world, this corresponds to the problem of estimating a\nprobability of failure of a system.

One of the\nmain contributions of this article is to derive SUR (stepwise uncertainty\nreduction) strategies from a Bayesian-theoretic formulation of the problem of\nestimating a probability of failure. These sequential strategies use a Gaussian\nprocess model of $f$ and aim at performing evaluations of $f$ as efficiently as\npossible to infer the value of the probability of failure. We compare these\nstrategies to other strategies also based on a Gaussian process model for\nestimating a probability of failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 07:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 20:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

This is also true for\nthe prompt optical emission observed in several bursts. Through Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we model such low-energy spectral excess components as hadronic\ncascade emission initiated by photomeson interactions of ultra-high-energy\nprotons accelerated within GRB outflows. Synchrotron radiation from the\ncascading, secondary electron-positron pairs can naturally reproduce the\nobserved soft spectra in the X-ray band, and in some cases the optical spectra\nas well. These components can be directly related to the higher energy\nradiation at GeV energies due to the hadronic cascades. Depending on the\nspectral shape, the total energy in protons is required to be comparable to or\nappreciably larger than the observed total photon energy. In particular, we\napply our model to the excess X-ray and GeV emission of GRB 090902B, and the\nbright optical emission of the \"naked-eye\" GRB 080319B.

We find that a vortex core, orbiting at the local gas velocity,\ninduces velocity perturbations that propagate away from the vortex as density\nwaves.

In the case of asymmetric waves, which we always find except for a\ndisk of constant pressure, there is a net exchange of angular momentum between\nthe vortex and the surrounding disk, which leads to orbital migration of the\nvortex. Numerical hydrodynamical simulations show that this migration can be\nvery rapid, on a time scale of a few thousand orbits, for vortices with a size\ncomparable to the scale height of the disk.

In\nthis paper, we look at a version of MQC in which we remove the adaptivity of\nmeasurements and aim to understand what computational abilities still remain in\nthe resource. We show that there are explicit connections between this model of\ncomputation and the question of non-classicality in quantum correlations. We\ndemonstrate this by focussing on deterministic computation of Boolean\nfunctions, in which natural generalisations of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) paradox emerge; we then explore probabilistic computation, via which\nmultipartite Bell Inequalities can be defined. We use this correspondence to\ndefine families of multi-party Bell inequalities, which we show to have a\nnumber of interesting contrasting properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 10:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 11:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 17:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-10"}

After reviewing the\nbasic properties of quantum plasmas, we present model equations (e.g. the\nquantum hydrodynamic and effective nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson equations)\nthat describe collective nonlinear phenomena at nanoscales. The effects of the\nelectron degeneracy arise due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Pauli's\nexclusion principle for overlapping electron wavefunctions that result in\ntunneling of electrons and the electron degeneracy pressure. Since electrons\nare Fermions (spin-1/2), there also appears an electron spin current and a spin\nforce acting on electrons due to the Bohr magnetization. The quantum effects\nproduce new aspects of electrostatic (ES) and electromagnetic (EM) waves in a\nquantum plasma that are summarized in here. Furthermore, we discuss nonlinear\nfeatures of ES ion waves and electron plasma oscillations (ESOs), as well as\nthe trapping of intense EM waves in quantum electron density cavities.\nSpecifically, simulation studies of the coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS)\nand Poisson equations reveal the formation and dynamics of localized ES\nstructures at nanoscales in a quantum plasma.

The least number of axial lines\nthat cover the free space of an urban environment or the space between\nbuildings constitute what is often called an axial map.

For a long time, generating\naxial lines with help of some graphic software has been a tedious manual\nprocess that is criticized for being time consuming, subjective, or even\narbitrary. In this paper, we redefine axial lines as the least number of\nindividual straight line segments mutually intersected along natural streets\nthat are generated from street center lines using the Gestalt principle of good\ncontinuity.

To research its\nproperties, the concept of DAC codeword distribution along proper and wrong\ndecoding paths has been introduced. For DAC codeword distribution of\nequiprobable binary sources along proper decoding paths, the problem was\nformatted as solving a system of functional equations. However, up to now, only\none closed form was obtained at rate 0.5, while in general cases, to find the\nclosed form of DAC codeword distribution still remains a very difficult task.\nThis paper proposes three kinds of approximation methods for DAC codeword\ndistribution of equiprobable binary sources along proper decoding paths:\nnumeric approximation, polynomial approximation, and Gaussian approximation.\nFirstly, as a general approach, a numeric method is iterated to find the\napproximation to DAC codeword distribution. Secondly, at rates lower than 0.5,\nDAC codeword distribution can be well approximated by a polynomial. Thirdly, at\nvery low rates, a Gaussian function centered at 0.5 is proved to be a good and\nsimple approximation to DAC codeword distribution. A simple way to estimate the\nvariance of Gaussian function is also proposed.

Here we describe a method to reduce the effects of scintillation by\na combination of pupil reconjugation and calibration using a comparison star.\nBecause scintillation is produced by high altitude turbulence, the range of\nangles over which the scintillation is correlated is small and therefore simple\ncorrection by a comparison star is normally impossible. We propose\nreconjugating the telescope pupil to a high dominant layer of turbulence, then\napodizing it before calibration with a comparison star. We find by simulation\nthat given a simple atmosphere with a single high altitude turbulent layer and\na strong surface layer a reduction in the intensity variance by a factor of ~30\nis possible. Given a more realistic atmosphere as measured by SCIDAR at San\nPedro M\\'artir we find that on a night with a strong high altitude layer we can\nexpect the median variance to be reduced by a factor of 11. By reducing the\nscintillation noise we will be able to detect much smaller changes in\nbrightness. If we assume a 2 m telescope and an exposure time of 30 seconds a\nreduction in the scintillation noise from 0.78 mmag to 0.21 mmag is possible,\nwhich will enable the routine detection of, for example, the secondary transits\nof extrasolar planets from the ground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 14:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Our framework\nprovides a well-controlled nonperturbative calculational scheme which can be\nsystematically improved. The state vector of a physical system is calculated in\nlight-front dynamics. From the general properties of this form of dynamics, the\nstate vector can be further decomposed in well-defined Fock components. In\norder to control the convergence of this expansion, we advocate the use of the\ncovariant formulation of light-front dynamics. In this formulation, the state\nvector is projected on an arbitrary light-front plane $\\omega \\cd x=0$ defined\nby a light-like four-vector $\\omega$. This enables us to control any violation\nof rotational invariance due to the truncation of the Fock expansion.

This general framework has been applied to a large variety of\nmodels. As a starting point, we consider QED for the two-body Fock space\ntruncation and calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

The formation of this\nmolecule in the interstellar medium cannot be explained by gas-phase chemistry\nonly and its surface hydrogenation formation routes at low temperatures (O, O2,\nO3 channels) are still unclear and most likely incomplete. In a previous paper\nwe discussed an unexpected zeroth-order H2O production behavior in O2 ice\nhydrogenation experiments compared to the first-order H2CO and CH3OH production\nbehavior found in former studies on hydrogenation of CO ice. In this paper we\nexperimentally investigate in detail how the structure of O2 ice leads to this\nrare behavior in reaction order and production yield. In our experiments H\natoms are added to a thick O2 ice under fully controlled conditions, while the\nchanges are followed by means of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy\n(RAIRS). The H-atom penetration mechanism is systematically studied by varying\nthe temperature, thickness and structure of the O2 ice. We conclude that the\ncompetition between reaction and diffusion of the H atoms into the O2 ice\nexplains the unexpected H2O and H2O2 formation behavior. In addition, we show\nthat the proposed O2 hydrogenation scheme is incomplete, suggesting that\nadditional surface reactions should be considered. Indeed, the detection of\nnewly formed O3 in the ice upon H-atom exposure proves that the O2 channel is\nnot an isolated route. Furthermore, the addition of H2 molecules is found not\nto have a measurable effect on the O2 reaction channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 14:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

In particular, the radiation feedback is computed by using the\nself-regulated Bondi accretion. The models are characterized by strong\noscillations when the galaxy is in the AGN state with a high accretion\nluminosity. We found that these one-zone models are able to reproduce two\nimportant phases of galaxy evolution, namely an obscured-cold phase when the\nbulk of star formation and black hole accretion occur, and the following\nquiescent hot phase in which accretion remains highly sub-Eddington. A\nCompton-thick phase is also found in almost all models, associated with the\ncold phase. An exploration of the parameter space reveals that the closest\nagreement with the present-day Magorrian relation is obtained, independently of\nthe dark matter halo mass, for galaxies with a low-mass seed black hole, and\nthe accretion radiative efficiency ~0.1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2010 15:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2010 16:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
