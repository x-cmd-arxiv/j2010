The first set of results from these\ncalculations was published in Ott et al. (2008). We have followed a nonrotating\nand a rapidly rotating 20 solar mass model for ~400 ms after bounce. We show\nthat the radiation fields vary much less with angle than the matter quantities\nin the region of net neutrino heating. This obtains because most neutrinos are\nemitted from inner radiative regions and because the specific intensity is an\nintegral over sources from many angles at depth. The latter effect can only be\ncaptured by multi-angle transport. We then compute the phase relationship\nbetween dipolar oscillations in the shock radius and in matter and radiation\nquantities throughout the postshock region. We demonstrate a connection between\nvariations in neutrino flux and the hydrodynamical shock oscillations, and use\na variant of the Rayleigh test to estimate the detectability of these neutrino\nfluctuations in IceCube and Super-K. Neglecting flavor oscillations,\nfluctuations in our nonrotating model would be detectable to ~10 kpc in\nIceCube, and a detailed power spectrum could be measured out to ~5 kpc. These\ndistances are considerably lower in our rapidly rotating model or with\nsignificant flavor oscillations. Finally, we measure the impact of rapid\nrotation on detectable neutrino signals. Our rapidly rotating model has strong,\nspecies-dependent asymmetries in both its peak neutrino flux and its light\ncurves.

We thereby demonstrate the connection between \"bad\nmetals\" (such as the high temperature superconductors) and \"perfect fluids\"\n(such as the ultracold Fermi gases, near unitarity). One motivation of this\nwork is to communicate to the high energy physics community some of the central\nunsolved problems in high $T_c$ superconductors. Because of interest in the\nnearly perfect fluidity of the cold gases and because of new tools such as the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, this better communication may lead to important\nprogress in a variety of different fields. A second motivation is to draw\nattention to the great power of transport measurements which more directly\nreflect the excitation spectrum than, say, thermodynamics and thus strongly\nconstrain microscopic theories of correlated fermionic superfluids. Our\ncalculations show that bad metal and perfect fluid behavior is associated with\nthe presence of a normal state excitation gap which suppresses the effective\nnumber of carriers leading to anomalously low conductivity and viscosity above\nthe transition temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ we demonstrate that the\ncondensate collective modes (\"phonons\") do not couple to transverse probes such\nas the shear viscosity.

Lyman transitions, in particular the\nLyman-alpha line, have long been recognized as one of the bottlenecks of\nrecombination, due to their very low escape probabilities. The Sobolev\napproximation does not describe radiative transfer in the vicinity of Lyman\nlines to a sufficient degree of accuracy, and several corrections have already\nbeen computed in other works. In this paper, the impact of some previously\nignored radiative transfer effects is calculated. First, the effect of Thomson\nscattering in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line is evaluated, using a full\nredistribution kernel incorporated into a radiative transfer code. The effect\nof feedback of distortions generated by the optically thick deuterium\nLyman-alpha line blueward of the hydrogen line is investigated with an analytic\napproximation. It is shown that both effects are negligible during cosmological\nhydrogen recombination. Secondly, the importance of high-lying, non overlapping\nLyman transitions is assessed. It is shown that escape from lines above\nLy-gamma and frequency diffusion in Ly-beta and higher lines can be neglected\nwithout loss of accuracy. Thirdly, a formalism generalizing the Sobolev\napproximation is developed to account for the overlap of the high-lying Lyman\nlines, which is shown to lead to negligible changes to the recombination\nhistory. Finally, the possibility of a cosmological hydrogen recombination\nmaser is investigated.

These issues take on practical\nsignificance in graphene, a hexagonal two-dimensional crystal of carbon atoms;\nSingle-atom-thick graphene sheets can now be produced by chemical vapor\ndeposition on up to meter scales, making their polycrystallinity almost\nunavoidable.

I\nintroduce a simple model that can explain experiments both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. In this theory, isotope substitution only affects the\nsuperfluid density, but not the pseudo-gap. Within the spin-charge separation\npicture, I argue that the spinon-phonon interaction is in the adiabatic limit,\nand therefore within the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, there is no isotope effect\nin the spinon mass renormalization. On the other hand, I show that the\nholon-phonon interaction is in the non-adiabatic limit. Therefore, the small\npolaron picture is applicable and there is a large mass enhancement in an\nisotope-dependent way. Our theory explains why upon $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O\nsubstitution, the superconducting transition temperature changes only in\nunderdoped cuprates, while there is no considerable OIE at the optimal doped as\nwell as the overdoped cuprates.

This can be\naccounted for by describing planet populations by means of a differential\nplanetary mass-radius-orbit function, which together with the fraction of stars\nwith given properties that are orbited by planets and the stellar mass function\nallows to derive all statistics for any considered sample. These fundamental\nfunctions provide a framework for comparing statistics that result from\ndifferent observing techniques and campaigns which all have their very specific\nselection procedures and detection efficiencies. Moreover, recent results both\nfrom gravitational microlensing campaigns and radial-velocity surveys of stars\nindicate that planets tend to cluster in systems rather than being the lonely\nchild of their respective parent star. While planetary multiplicity in an\nobserved system becomes obvious with the detection of several planets, its\nquantitative assessment however comes with the challenge to exclude the\npresence of further planets. Current exoplanet samples begin to give us first\nhints at the population statistics, whereas pictures of planet parameter space\nin its full complexity call for samples that are 2-4 orders of magnitude\nlarger. In order to derive meaningful statistics however, planet detection\ncampaigns need to be designed in such a way that well-defined\nfully-deterministic target selection, monitoring, and detection criteria are\napplied. The probabilistic nature of gravitational microlensing makes this\ntechnique an illustrative example of all the encountered challenges and\nuncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 22:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The mixed-norm\nregularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many\napplications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group\nsparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,\nchallenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization.\nExisting work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they\ncannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the\nL1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than\n1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the\nproposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why\nEP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the\nspecial cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient\nalgorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems.

The SI${^{+}}$ -- SI${^{-}}$ pair, was closely correlated with\ncorresponding variations in the solar wind density, while solar wind velocity\nand the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field (Bz) did not\nshow any correspondence. Further, this event had no source on the visible solar\ndisk. However, a rear-side partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME) and an M1.4\nclass solar flare behind the west limb, took place on 20 April 1998, the date\ncorresponding to the traceback location of the solar wind flows. This event\npresents empirical evidence, which to our knowledge, is the best convincing\nevidence for the association of specific solar events to the observations of an\nSI${^{+}}$ -- SI${^{-}}$ pair. In addition, it shows that it is possible for a\nrear side solar flare to propagate a shock towards the earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 07:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A major open issue is to verify the presence of LPPL in\nprice sequences and to estimate the LPPL parameters. Estimation is complicated\nby the fact that daily LPPL returns are typically orders of magnitude smaller\nthan measured price returns, suggesting that noise obscures the underlying LPPL\ndynamics. However, if noise is mean-reverting, it would quickly cancel out over\nsubsequent measurements. In this paper, we attempt to reject mean-reverting\nnoise from price sequences by exploiting frequency-domain properties of LPPL\nand of mean reversion. First, we calculate the spectrum of mean-reverting \\ou\nnoise and devise estimators for the noise's parameters. Then, we derive the\nLPPL spectrum by breaking it down into its two main characteristics of power\nlaw and of log-periodicity. We compare price spectra with noise spectra during\nhistorical bubbles. In general, noise was strong also at low frequencies and,\neven if LPPL underlied price dynamics, LPPL would be obscured by noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 13:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2011 13:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

Energetic ions provide one\nway of achieving this challenging goal. Single heavy ions with kinetic energies\nin the 100 MeV range will produce nanometer-sized defects on dielectric but\ngenerally not on crystalline metal surfaces. In a metal the ion-induced\nelectronic excitations are efficiently dissipated by the conduction electrons\nbefore the transfer of energy to the lattice atoms sets in. Therefore, graphene\nis not expected to be irradiation sensitive beyond the creation of point\ndefects. Here we show that graphene on a dielectric substrate sustains major\nmodifications if irradiated under oblique angles. Due to a combination of\ndefect creation in the graphene layer and hillock creation in the substrate,\ngraphene is split and folded along the ion track yielding double layer\nnanoribbons. Our results indicate that the radiation hardness of graphene\ndevices is questionable but also open up a new way of introducing extended\nlow-dimensional defects in a controlled way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 14:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-27"}

These features of the system are stable with respect to perturbations\nin lipid interaction parameters used in our simulations.

Resonant absorption and ion-neutral collisions (Cowling's\ndiffusion) are the damping mechanisms taken into account. The dispersion\nrelation of resonant kink waves in a partially ionized magnetic flux tube is\nnumerically solved by considering prominence conditions. Analytical expressions\nof the wavelength and damping length as functions of the kink mode frequency\nare obtained in the Thin Tube and Thin Boundary approximations. For typically\nreported periods of thread oscillations, resonant absorption is an efficient\nmechanism for the kink mode spatial damping, while ion-neutral collisions have\na minor role.

With the current generation of these experiments finishing data\ntaking it is time to plan for the next and search for an optimal setup.

Our main example are axion(-like\nparticle)s but we also discuss implications for other WISPs (weakly interacting\nslim particles) such as hidden U(1) gauge bosons. To improve the sensitivity\nfor axions towards smaller couplings one can use multiple magnets to increase\nthe length of the interaction region.

We compute the\nconservative part of the self-force for a particle in circular orbit around a\nSchwarzschild black hole. The gauge vector relating our radiation gauge to a\nLorenz gauge is helically symmetric, implying that the quantity h_{\\alpha\\beta}\nu^\\alpha u^\\beta (= h_{uu}) must have the same value for our radiation gauge as\nfor a Lorenz gauge; and we confirm this numerically to one part in 10^{13}.

This differs only by a constant from its form\nfor a Lorenz gauge. It is because we do not use a radiation gauge to describe\nthe change in black-hole mass that the singular part of the self-force has no\nsingularity along a radial line through the particle and, at least in this\nexample, is spherically symmetric to subleading order in \\rho.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 15:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 16:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 03:56:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 20:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}
