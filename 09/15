The functioning of various\ncomputational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register\nmachines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS\nare computationally complete; however, a direct translation leads to quite a\nbig number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete\ndevices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest\nnumber of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization\nstrategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We\napply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine\n(Korec, 1996) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules.\nSince MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport\nrules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number\nof rules for those systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 16:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-15"}

However, it has never shown evidence for on-going\nmass loss or for any form of comet-like activity that would indicate the\ncontinued replenishment of the stream. Following an alert by Battams and Watson\n(2009), we used NASA's STEREO-A spacecraft to image Phaethon near perihelion,\nin the period UT 2009 June 17 - 22, when the heliocentric distance was near\n0.14 AU. The resulting photometry shows an unexpected brightening, by a factor\nof two, starting UT 2009 June 20.2+/-0.2, which we interpret as an impulsive\nrelease of dust particles from Phaethon. If the density is near 2500 kg/m^3,\nthen the emitted dust particles must have a combined mass of ~2.5x10^8 a1 kg,\nwhere a1 is the particle radius in millimeters. Assuming a1 = 1, this is\napproximately 10^-4 of the Geminid stream mass and to replenish the stream in\nsteady-state within its estimated ~1000 yr lifetime would require ~10 events\nlike the one observed, per orbit. Alternatively, on-going mass loss may be\nunrelated to the event which produced the Phaethon-Geminid complex. An impact\norigin of the dust is highly unlikely. Phaethon is too hot for water ice to\nsurvive, rendering unlikely the possibility that dust is ejected through\ngas-drag from sublimated ice. Instead, we suggest that Phaethon is essentially\na rock comet, in which the small perihelion distance leads both to the\nproduction of dust (through thermal fracture and decomposition-cracking of\nhydrated minerals) and to its ejection into interplanetary space (through\nradiation pressure sweeping and other effects).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 16:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Our first\nalgorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by\nidentifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the\nmain contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as\nCLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree\nover the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the\nobserved nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent\ntree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures)\non much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and\nefficient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our\nalgorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions.

In contrast, CMB non-Gaussianity due to inflationary scalar\nperturbations arises only as a higher order effect. Apart from a compensated\nscalar mode, stochastic primordial magnetic fields also produce scalar\nanisotropic stress that remains uncompensated till neutrino decoupling. This\ngives rise to an adiabatic-like scalar perturbation mode that evolves passively\nthereafter (called the passive mode). We compute the CMB reduced bispectrum\n($b_{l_{_1}l_{_2}l_{_3}}$) induced by this passive mode, sourced via the\nSachs-Wolfe effect, on large angular scales. For any configuration of\nbispectrum, taking a partial sum over mode-coupling terms, we find a typical\nvalue of $l_1(l_1+1)l_3(l_3+1) b_{l_{_1}l_{_2}l_{_3}} \\sim 6-9 \\times\n10^{-16}$, for a magnetic field of $B_0 \\sim 3$ nG, assuming a nearly\nscale-invariant magnetic spectrum . We also evaluate, in full, the bispectrum\nfor the squeezed collinear configuration over all angular mode-coupling terms\nand find $l_1(l_1+1)l_3(l_3+1) b_{l_{_1}l_{_2}l_{_3}} \\approx -1.4 \\times\n10^{-16}$. These values are more than $\\sim 10^6$ times larger than the\npreviously calculated magnetic compensated scalar mode CMB bispectrum.\nObservational limits on the bispectrum from WMAP7 data allow us to set upper\nlimits of $B_0 \\sim 2$ nG on the present value of the cosmic magnetic field of\nprimordial origin. This is over 10 times more stringent than earlier limits on\n$B_0$ based on the compensated mode bispectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 17:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

Obtaining these speedups requires\nmitigation of a high-frequency instability that otherwise limits effectiveness\nin addition to solutions for handling data input and output in a\nrelativistically boosted frame of reference. The observed high-frequency\ninstability is mitigated using methods including an electromagnetic solver with\ntunable coefficients, its extension to accomodate Perfectly Matched Layers and\nFriedman's damping algorithms, as well as an efficient large bandwidth digital\nfilter. It is shown that choosing the frame of the wake as the frame of\nreference allows for higher levels of filtering and damping than is possible in\nother frames for the same accuracy. Detailed testing also revealed\nserendipitously the existence of a singular time step at which the instability\nlevel is minimized, independently of numerical dispersion, thus indicating that\nthe observed instability may not be due primarily to Numerical Cerenkov as has\nbeen conjectured. The techniques developed for Cerenkov mitigation prove\nnonetheless to be very efficient at controlling the instability. Using these\ntechniques, agreement at the percentage level is demonstrated between\nsimulations using different frames of reference, with speedups reaching two\norders of magnitude for a 0.1 GeV class stages. The method then allows direct\nand efficient full-scale modeling of deeply depleted laser-plasma stages of 10\nGeV-1 TeV for the first time, verifying the scaling of plasma accelerators to\nvery high energies. Over 4, 5 and 6 orders of magnitude speedup is achieved for\nthe modeling of 10 GeV, 100 GeV and 1 TeV class stages, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 18:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 00:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We utilize a full numerical\nsolution in the diffusive regime of transport and study the behavior of the\nsupercurrent for various experimentally relevant configurations of the\nferromagnetic trilayer. We obtain qualitatively very good agreement with\nexperimental data regarding the behavior of the supercurrent as a function of\nthe width of the Co-layer, $L_\\text{Co}$. Moreover, we find a synthesis of\n0-$\\pi$ oscillations with superimposed rapid oscillations when varying the\nwidth of the Ho-layer which pertain specifically to the spiral magnetization\ntexture in Ho. We are not able to reproduce the anomalous peaks in the\nsupercurrent observed experimentally in this regime, but note that the results\nobtained are quite sensitive to the exact magnetization profile in the\nHo-layers, which could be the reason for the discrepancy between our model and\nthe experimental reported data for this particular aspect. We also investigate\nthe supercurrent in a system where the intrinsically inhomogeneous Ho\nferromagnets are replaced with domain-wall ferromagnets, and find similar\nbehavior as in the Ho$\\mid$Co$\\mid$Ho case. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ntype of magnetic Josephson junction including only a domain-wall ferromagnet\nand a homogeneous ferromagnetic layer, which in addition to simplicity\nregarding the magnetization profile also offers a tunable long-range\nspin-triplet supercurrent. Finally, we discuss some experimental aspects of our\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate with\nstellar effective temperature when estimated from broad band optical/infrared\nphotometry. To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for\nestimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction.\nIt uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to\nprovide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the\nparameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the\nHertzsprung--Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that\nthey respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to\nestimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of\nartificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective\ntemperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. Using just\nthe four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation)\nbetween the temperature and extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent\nmagnitude and the HRD reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision\n(reduces the error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the\nlatter by about 35%. The resulting accuracy is about 200K in temperature and\n0.2mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these parameters and\nabsolute magnitudes for some 47000 F,G,K Hipparcos stars which have been\ncross-matched with 2MASS.

Our main results are summarized in\nTables 3 and 4. The averaged sigma \"direct width\" to gamma-gamma is 0.16(3) keV\nwhich confirms a previous result of [1] and which does neither favour a large\nfour-quark (diquark-antidiquark) nor a molecule nor a pure \\bar qq component.\nThe \"direct width\" of the f_0(980) of 0.28(2) keV is much larger than the\nfour-quark expectation but can be compatible with a \\bar ss or gluonium\ncomponent. We also found that the rescattering part of the amplitude is\nrelatively large indicating an important contribution of the meson loops in the\ndetermination of the gamma-gamma total widths. This is mainly due to the large\ncouplings of the sigma and f_0(980) to pi-pi and/or \\bar KK, which can also be\ndue to a light scalar gluonium with large OZI violating couplings but not\nnecessary to a four-quark or molecule state.

One of the established methods for achieving this is to iteratively\nmaximize a likelihood function (ML), which requires initialization with an\napproximate solution to avoid convergence towards local extrema. This paper\ndevelops methods for handling both Gaussian and Laplacian noise, the latter\nmodeling the presence of outliers in some practical ranging systems that\nadversely affect the performance of localization algorithms designed for\nGaussian noise. A modified Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) completion problem\nis solved for a block of target range measurements to approximately set up\ninitial sensor/target positions, and the likelihood function is then\niteratively refined through Majorization-Minimization (MM). To avoid the\ncomputational burden of repeatedly solving increasingly large EDM problems in\ntime-recursive operation an incremental scheme is exploited whereby a new\ntarget/node position is estimated from previously available node/target\nlocations to set up the iterative ML initial point for the full spatial\nconfiguration. The above methods are first derived under Gaussian noise\nassumptions, and modifications for Laplacian noise are then considered.\nAnalytically, the main challenges to be overcome in the Laplacian case stem\nfrom the non-differentiability of $\\ell_1$ norms that arise in the various cost\nfunctions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms\nsignificantly outperform existing methods for SLAT in the presence of outliers,\nwhile offering comparable performance for Gaussian noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 21:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

If this emission is\nindeed blackbody in nature, the derived luminosity\n[3.5(+3.3,-1.5)x10^(44)ergs/s] infers a compact emitting area with a size\n[~5x10^(12)cm or 0.33AU in radius] that is comparable to several times the\nSchwarzschild radius of a black hole at the mass estimated for this AGN\n(3x10^6Msun). In fact, this ultra-steep X-ray emission can be well fitted as\nthe (Compton scattered) Wien tail of the multi-temperature blackbody emission\nfrom an optically thick accretion disc, whose parameters inferred (black hole\nmass and accretion rate) are in good agreement with independent estimates using\noptical emission line spectrum. We thus consider this feature as a signature of\nthe long-sought X-ray radiation directly from a disc around a super-massive\nblack hole, presenting observational evidence for a black hole accretion disc\nin AGN. Future observations with better data quality, together with improved\nindependent measurements of the black hole mass, may constrain the spin of the\nblack hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 23:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The flow\ncorresponds to forced two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence in doubly\nperiodic and circular bounded domains with non-slip boundary conditions. In the\ndouble periodic domain, the probability density function (pdf) of the Weiss\nfield exhibits a negative skewness consistent with the fact that in periodic\ndomains the flow is dominated by coherent vortex structures.

A central problem is the relation\nbetween systems which appear macroscopically dissipative but are\nmicroscopically lossless. We show that a linear system is dissipative if, and\nonly if, it can be approximated by a linear lossless system over arbitrarily\nlong time intervals. Hence lossless systems are in this sense dense in\ndissipative systems. A linear active system can be approximated by a nonlinear\nlossless system that is charged with initial energy. As a by-product, we obtain\nmechanisms explaining the Onsager relations from time-reversible lossless\napproximations, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from uncertainty in the\ninitial state of the lossless system. The results are applied to measurement\ndevices and are used to quantify limits on the so-called observer effect, also\ncalled back action, which is the impact the measurement device has on the\nobserved system. In particular, it is shown that deterministic back action can\nbe compensated by using active elements, whereas stochastic back action is\nunavoidable and depends on the temperature of the measurement device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 04:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Aims: We study\nbasic properties of turbulence in thermally bistable gas for variable\nsimulation parameters.

Methods: Turbulent flow is\ninduced on large scales by means of compressive stochastic forcing in a\nperiodic box.

We find that it has had a stable period of about 300 d in soft and\nhard X-rays and in radio since 2005 until at least 2010, which is about double\nthe previously seen period. This new period, seen in the hard spectral state\nonly, is detected not only in the light curves but also in soft X-ray hardness\nratios and in the amplitude of the orbital modulation. On the other hand, the\nspectral slope in hard X-rays, >20 keV, averaged over superorbital bins is\nconstant, and the soft and hard X-rays and the radio emission change in phase.\nThis shows that the superorbital variability consists of changing the\nnormalization of an intrinsic spectrum of a constant shape and of changes of\nthe absorbing column density with the phase. The maximum column density is\nachieved at the superorbital minimum. The amplitude changes are likely to be\ncaused by a changing viewing angle of an anisotropic emitter, most likely a\nprecessing accretion disc. The constant shape of the intrinsic spectrum shows\nthat this modulation is not caused by a changing accretion rate. The modulated\nabsorbing column density shows the presence of a bulge around the disc centre,\nas proposed previously.

We examine how properties such as\nthe colour magnitude relation, structure and morphology are affected by\nenvironment for the lowest mass galaxies. The low masses of dwarf galaxies\nallow us to determine their environmentally driven based galaxy evolution, the\neffects of which are harder to examine in massive galaxies. The structures of\nour dwarfs in both the core and outer regions of the cluster are quantified\nusing the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters. We find\nthat, on average, dwarfs in the outer regions of Perseus are more disturbed\nthan those in the cluster core, with higher asymmetries and clumpier light\ndistributions. We measure the (V-I)_0 colours of the dEs, and find that dwarfs\nin both the inner and outer regions of the cluster lie on the same colour\nmagnitude relation. Based on these results, we infer that the disturbed dwarfs\nin the cluster outskirts are likely \"transition dwarfs\", with their colours\ntransforming before their structures. Finally, we infer from the smoothness of\nthe cluster core population that dwarfs in the inner regions of the cluster\nmust be highly dark matter dominated to prevent their disruption by the cluster\npotential. We derive a new method to determine the minimum mass the dwarfs must\nhave to prevent this disruption without the need for resolved spectroscopy, and\ndetermine their mass-to-light ratios. At their orbit pericentre, dwarfs in the\ncore of Perseus require mass-to-light ratios between 1 and 120 to prevent their\ndisruption, comparable to those found for the Local Group dSphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 13:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Then, the nature of gauge\ntransformations, of gauge fields and of conserved charges have been given a\ngeometric meaning in terms of a scale-covariant derivative tool. Finally, the\nelectromagnetic Klein-Gordon equation has been recovered with a covariant\nderivative constructed by combining the quantum-covariant velocity operator and\nthe scale-covariant derivative. We show here that if one tries to derive the\nelectromagnetic Dirac equation from the Klein-Gordon one as for the free\nparticle motion, i.e. as a square root of the time part of the Klein-Gordon\noperator, one obtains an additional term which is the relativistic analog of\nthe spin-magnetic field coupling term of the Pauli equation. However, if one\nfirst applies the quantum covariance, then implements the scale covariance\nthrough the scale-covariant derivative, one obtains the electromagnetic Dirac\nequation in its usual form.

We illustrate three ideas that arise\nwhen considering inverse problems in the multiscale context. The first idea is\nthat the choice of space or set in which to seek the solution to the inverse\nproblem is intimately related to whether a homogenized or full multiscale\nsolution is required. This is a choice of regularization. The second idea is\nthat, if a homogenized solution to the inverse problem is what is desired, then\nthis can be recovered from carefully designed observations of the full\nmultiscale system. The third idea is that the theory of homogenization can be\nused to improve the estimation of homogenized coefficients from multiscale\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 14:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-16"}

Firstly, modifications are proposed in the radio\nrange of the fixed-grid nodes, keeping in mind the actual radio range of\ncommonly available nodes, to allow for routing through them. Routing is not\naddressed by GRADELOC, but is of prime importance to the deployment of any\nadhoc network, especially sensor networks. A theoretical model expressing the\nradio range in terms of the cell dimensions of the grid infrastructure is\nproposed, to help in carrying out a deployment plan which achieves the\ndesirable precision of coarse-grained localization.
