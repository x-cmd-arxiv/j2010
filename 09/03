This paper provides a tutorial overview of\nexisting image formation techniques and outlines some of the future directions\nneeded for information extraction from future radio telescopes. We describe the\nimaging process from measurement equation until deconvolution, both as a\nFourier inversion problem and as an array processing estimation problem.

With this, observations of the multiple star system\ncontaining the merger product(s) can be used to work backwards in order to\nconstrain the initial orbital energies of any single, binary or triple systems\nthat went into the encounter. The initial semi-major axes of the orbits provide\nan estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time-scale for\nthe encounter to occur in its host cluster. We have applied our analytic\nprescription to observed binary and triple systems containing blue stragglers,\nin particular the triple system S1082 in M67 and the period distribution of the\nblue straggler binaries in NGC 188. We have shown that both S1082 and most of\nthe blue straggler binaries in NGC 188 could have a dynamical origin, and that\nencounters involving triples could be a significant contributor to BS\npopulations in old open clusters.

The evolutionary timescales of the model disks can be sped up or\nslowed down by altering the amount of far-ultraviolet flux or the viscosity\nparameter alpha. Slowing the evolutionary timescale by decreasing the incident\nfar ultraviolet flux, or similarly by decreasing alpha, can help to grow\nplanets more rapidly, but at the cost of decreased migration timescales.\nAlthough they similarly affect relevant timescales, changes in the far\nultraviolet flux or alpha produce disks with drastically different outer radii.\nDespite their differences, these disks are all characterized by outward mass\ntransport, mass loss at the outer edge, and a truncated outer boundary. The\ntransport of mass from small to large radii can potentially prevent the rapid\ninward migration of Jupiter and Saturn, while at the same time supply enough\nmass to the outer regions of the disk for the formation of Uranus and Neptune.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 17:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Thus observations\nof particle spectra and correlations have definitive implications on the\npartonic processes at all transverse momenta. After presenting a general review\nof the subject at the Workshop, I selected two topics in nuclear collisions for\nmore detailed discussion, which are summarized here. One is on the azimuthal\nanisotropy at low $p_T$ due to hard or semihard scattering of partons that\ncreate ridges with or without triggers. The ridge particles are the products of\nrecombination of thermal partons enhanced by the energy loss of hard or\nsemihard partons. Their $\\phi$ dependence at midrapidity can be determined\nessentially from geometry. The other topic is on the scaling behavior in $\\phi$\nand centrality at high $p_T$, where the hadronization process is dominated by\nTS and SS recombination. The relevant RHIC data are found to have the same\nscaling behavior. But at LHC such scaling is badly broken at $p_T \\sim 10$\nGeV/c if two-jet recombination is important.

The purpose of this\narticle is to shed more light on these interactions. We prove that if X and X'\nare cobordant closed smooth 4-manifolds with the same euler characteristics,\nand if one of them is simply-connected, then there is a cobordism between them\nwhich is composed of round 2-handles only, and therefore one can pass from one\nto the other via a sequence of generalized logarithmic transforms along tori.\nAs a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of Iwase's, which is a\n4-dimensional analogue of the Lickorish-Wallace theorem for 3-manifolds: Every\nclosed simply-connected 4-manifold can be produced by a surgery along a\ndisjoint union of tori contained in a connected sum of copies of CP^2, -CP^2\nand S^1 x S^3. These answer some of the open problems posted by Ron Stern,\nwhile suggesting more constraints on the cobordisms in consideration.

In particular, we show\nthat simple cobordisms exist between knot surgered manifolds. We then show that\ngeneralized logarithmic transforms can be seen as standard logarithmic\ntransforms along fiber components of broken Lefschetz fibrations, and show how\nchanging the smooth structures on a fixed homeomorphism class of a closed\nsmooth 4-manifold can be realized as relevant modifications of a broken\nLefschetz fibration on it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 19:35:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 00:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2012 11:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Period distributions show\ndistinct differences between SMC and LMC populations of RR Lyr variable stars,\nwith the SMC stars having on average longer periods. The mean periods for RRab,\nRRc and RRe stars are 0.596, 0.366 and 0.293 days, respectively. The mean\napparent magnitudes of RRab stars are equal to 19.70 mag in the V-band and\n19.12 mag in the I-band.

Very high speed water jets\n(~80-200 m/s) are typically used in such cleaning operations. These jets\ndiffuse in the surrounding atmosphere by the process of air entrainment and\nthis contributes to the spreading of the jet and subsequent decay of pressure.\nEstimation of this pressure decay and subsequent placement of the cleaning\nobject is of paramount importance in manufacturing and material processing\nindustries. Also, the pressure distribution on the cleaning surface needs to be\nassessed in order to understand and optimize the material removal process. In\nan industrial setting, experimental study is performed to formulate the\npressure characteristics. It has shown that the decay of stagnation pressure\nalong the axial direction is linear. It also revealed that no cleaning is\npossible at radial locations greater than 1.68D from the centerline. Numerical\nsimulations are performed to capture the process of air entrainment in the jet\nand the subsequent pressure characteristics. The simulation results are found\nto correctly predict the experimental data.

This technique informs our views of\nhow galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. Unfortunately, there are\nmany outstanding uncertainties associated with these \"virial\" mass estimates.\nOne of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for the\nbroad-line region. Incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity active\ngalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at Lick Observatory, we\nrecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretion\nluminosity other than the optical continuum. We find that the radius of the\nbroad-line region scales as the square root of the X-ray and Hbeta\nluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. On the other hand, the\nscaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. This is\nconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line to\nX-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. The radius of the broad-line\nregion correlates most tightly with Hbeta luminosity, while the X-ray and\nnarrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two.

The\ninterdiction objective is to find the optimal set of edges to cut given that\nthere is a finite interdiction budget and the interdictor must move first.

When the local fluid flow-induced stress is\nlarger than a critical threshold, grains are dislodged and carried away so that\nthe porosity of the medium is altered by erosion. This in turn affects the\nlocal hydraulic conductivity and pressure in the medium and results in the\ngrowth and development of channels that preferentially conduct the flow. Our\nmultiphase model involves a dynamical porosity field that evolves along with\nthe volume fraction of the mobile and immobile grains in response to fluid flow\nthat couples the spatiotemporal dynamics of the three phases. Numerical\nsolutions of the resulting initial boundary value problem show how channels\nform in porous media and highlights how heterogeneity in the erosion threshold\ndictates the form of the patterns and thus the ability to control them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 01:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-06"}

The\nlarge amount of recent and new data clearly indicates that breakup hinders the\nfusion at near and below the Coulomb barrier energies. However, clear evidence\nfor the halo enhancements, seems to over ride the breakup hindrance at lower\nenergies, owing, to a large extent, to the extended matter density\ndistribution. In particular we report here that at sub-barrier energies the\nfusion cross section of the Borromean two-neutron halo nucleus $^{6}$He with\nthe actinide nucleus $^{238}$U is significantly enhanced compared to the fusion\nof a no-halo $^{6}$He. This conclusion differs from that of the original work,\nwhere it was claimed that no such enhancement ensues. This sub-barrier fusion\nenhancement was also observed in the $^{6}$He + $^{209}$% Bi system. The role\nof the corresponding easily excitable low lying dipole pygmy resonance in these\nsystems is therefore significant. The consequence of this overall enhanced\nfusion of halo nuclei at sub-barrier energies, on stellar evolution and\nnucleosynthesis is evident.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 02:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-27"}

Minkowski tensors provide a set of\nshape measures that are based on strong mathematical theorems and easily\ncomputed for polygonal and polyhedral bodies such as free volume cells (Voronoi\ncells). They characterize the local structure beyond the two-point correlation\nfunction and are suitable to define indices $0\\leq \\beta_\\nu^{a,b}\\leq 1$ of\nlocal anisotropy. Here, we analyze the statistics of Minkowski tensors for\nconfigurations of simple liquid models, including the ideal gas (Poisson point\nprocess), the hard disks and hard spheres ensemble, and the Lennard-Jones\nfluid. We show that Minkowski tensors provide a robust characterization of\nlocal anisotropy, which ranges from $\\beta_\\nu^{a,b}\\approx 0.3$ for vapor\nphases to $\\beta_\\nu^{a,b}\\to 1$ for ordered solids. We find that for fluids,\nlocal anisotropy decreases monotonously with increasing free volume and\nrandomness of particle positions. Furthermore, the local anisotropy indices\n$\\beta_\\nu^{a,b}$ are sensitive to structural transitions in these simple\nfluids, as has been previously shown in granular systems for the transition\nfrom loose to jammed bead packs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 08:18:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 14:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-04"}

We suggest that the configuration space may be considered\nas the reduced holonomy bundle with a connection induced by the mechanical\nconnection. Using the fact that for the special case of the three-body problem,\nthe holonomy group is SO(2) (as opposed to SO(3) like in systems with more than\nthree bodies) we obtain a holonomy reduced configuration space of topology $\n\\mathbf{R}_+^3 \\times S^1$. The dynamics then takes place on the cotangent\nbundle over the holonomy reduced configuration space. On this phase space there\nis an $S^1$ symmetry action coming from the conserved reduced angular momentum\nwhich can be reduced using the standard symplectic reduction method. Using a\ntheorem by Arnold it follows that the resulting symmetry reduced phase space is\nagain a natural mechanical phase space, i.e. a cotangent bundle. This is\ndifferent from what is obtained from the usual approach where symplectic\nreduction is used from the outset.

They also proposed a diagnostic for finding such sources using CO and\nHCN molecular lines. Given that such high column densities are expected to\nabsorb any X-ray luminous AGN, yielding Compton-thick sources, we set out\ntoexplore whether this can be discerned using X-ray observations. More\nspecifically we examine X-ray spectral observations of 14 sources in their\nsample, using public Chandra observations (0.5-10 keV) for eleven sources as\nwell as BeppoSAX results (2-100 keV) from the literature for another three\nsources. Our goal is to find candidate Compton-thick AGN and to check whether\nthe molecular line selection criterion is successful in selecting such systems.\nX-ray spectroscopy reveals four candidate Compton-thick AGN of which half fall\nwithin the high obscuration region in the molecular line ratio diagnostics. Of\nthe remaining five sources falling into the `high dust obscuration' box, one\n(Mrk273) is highly obscured (N_H ~4x10^23 cm-2) while in the other four the\nX-ray emission is most probably associated with star-forming processes rather\nthan an AGN on the basis of their X-ray and mid-infrared properties. Overall,\nwe argue that although this method as expected cannot recover all Compton-thick\nAGN, there are no examples of X-ray luminous AGN inside that region that have\nlow obscuration, suggesting that this method is efficient in finding heavily\nobscured AGN in dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies.

The HI\nis located in a 160kpc disk (~3xD_25) and has low surface density (<2Msun\npc^{-2}). The disk shows regular rotation for r<65kpc but several signs of\nrecent and ongoing interaction and merging with fairly massive companions are\nobserved. No population of cold gas clouds is observed - in contrast to what is\nfound in some spiral galaxies. This suggests that currently the main mechanism\nbringing in cold gas to the disk is the accretion of fairly massive satellite\ngalaxies, rather than the accretion of a large number of small gas clumps. NGC\n1167 is located in a (gas-) rich environment: we detect eight companions with a\ntotal HI mass of ~6x10^9Msun within a projected distance of 350kpc. Deep\noptical images show a disrupted satellite at the northern edge of the HI disk.\nThe observed rotation curve shows a prominent bump of about 50km/s (in the\nplane of the disk) at r=1.3xR_25. This feature in the rotation curve occurs at\nthe radius where the HI surface density drops significantly and may be due to\nlarge-scale streaming motions in the disk. We suspect that both the streaming\nmotions and the HI density distribution are the result of the\ninteraction/accretion with the disrupted satellite. Like in other galaxies with\nwiggles and bumps in the rotation curve, HI scaling describes the observed\nrotation curve best. We suggest that interactions create streaming motions and\nfeatures in the HI density distribution and that this is the reason for the\nsuccess of HI scaling in fitting such rotation curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 13:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The MWPI, a diagnostic nowcasting product, is designed to infer\nattributes of a favorable microburst environment: large CAPE and a convective\nmixed layer with a steep temperature lapse rate and low relative humidity in\nthe surface layer.

These\nobservations have detected a \"core-jet\" structure and a possible weak\ncounterjet component at 1.6 GHz. The upper limits to the core and jet (1.6-4.9\nGHz) spectral index are 0.6 and 0.3, respectively. Taken together with the high\nbrightness temperature of ~10^7 K for the core region, the radio emission\nappears to be coming from a synchrotron jet. At a position angle of 25 degrees,\nthe parsec-scale jet seems to be pointing closely toward the western edge of\nthe southern kpc-scale bubble in NGC 6764. A real connection between the\nparsec- and sub-kpc-scale emission would not only suggest the presence of a\ncurved jet, but also a close link between the AGN jet and the radio bubbles in\nNGC 6764. We demonstrate that a precessing jet model can explain the radio\nmorphology from parsec- to sub-kpc scales, and the model best-fit parameters of\njet speed and orientation are fully consistent with the observed\njet-to-counterjet surface brightness ratio. The jet however appears to be\ndisrupted on scales of hundreds of parsecs, possibly due to interaction with\nand entrainment of the interstellar medium gas, which subsequently leads to the\nformation of bubbles. The jet energetics in NGC 6764 suggest that it would take\n12-21 Myr to inflate the (southern) bubble. This timescale corresponds roughly\nto the starburst episode that took place in NGC 6764 about 15-50 Myr ago, and\ncould be indicative of a close connection between jet formation and the\nstarburst activity in this galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 15:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 16:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
