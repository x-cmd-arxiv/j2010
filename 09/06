We argue that the \"nonlinear nonequilibrium\"\ncontribution is unavoidable, and is determined uniquely once we accept the\n(very natural) definition of the excess heat. Moreover it turns out that to\noperationally determine the difference in the nonequilibrium entropy to the\nsecond order in the temperature difference, one may only use the previous\nClausius relation without a nonlinear term or must use the new relation,\ndepending on the operation (i.e., the path in the parameter space).

The observable quantities which\ncharacterize this component dominating the emission below 30 keV, are the\nspectral index alpha and the rollover energy, both related to the electron\ntemperature and optical depth of the plasma. Starting from observational\nresults on a sample of NS LMXBs in different spectral states, we formulate the\nproblem of X-ray spectral formation in the TL of these sources. We predict a\nstability of the thermal Comptonization spectral index in different spectral\nstates if the energy release in the TL is much higher than the intercepted flux\ncoming from the accretion disk. We use an equation for the energy balance and\nthe radiative transfer diffusion equation for a slab geometry in the TL, to\nderive a formula for the thermal Comptonization index alpha. We show that in\nthis approximation the TL electron temperature kTe and optical depth tau_0 can\nbe written as a function of the energy flux from the disk intercepted by the\ncorona (TL) and that in the corona itself Qdisk/Qcor, in turn leading to a\nrelation alpha=f(Qdisk/Qcor), with alpha ~ 1 when Qdisk/Qcor <<1.

It consists of a knotty ring expanding at a speed\nof 28 km/s, and a fast collimated outflow in the form of faint lobes and caps\nalong the direction perpendicular to the ring. The expansion speed of the polar\ncaps is 100 km/s, and their kinematical age is twice as large as the age of the\nring. Time-resolved photometry of the central star of IPHASXJ194359.5+170901\nreveals a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 1.16 days. This is interpreted\nas evidence for binarity of the central star, the brightness variations being\nrelated to the orbital motion of an irradiated companion. This is supported by\nthe spectrum of the central star in the visible range, which appears to be\ndominated by emission from the irradiated zone, consisting of a warm (6000-7000\nK) continuum, narrow C III, C IV, and N III emission lines, and broader lines\nfrom a flat H I Balmer sequence in emission. IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 helps to\nclarify the role of (close) binaries in the formation and shaping of planetary\nnebulae. The output of the common-envelope evolution of the system is a\nstrongly flattened circumstellar mass deposition, a feature that seems to be\ndistinctive of this kind of binary system. Also, IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 is\namong the first post-CE PNe for which the existence of a high-velocity polar\noutflow has been demonstrated. Its kinematical age might indicate that the\npolar outflow is formed before the common-envelope phase.

The two\nnon coupled spins which differ in the value of their chemical offsets are\ncontrolled by the same magnetic fields. Using an appropriate rotating frame, we\nrestrict the study to the case of opposite shifts. We then show that the\noptimal solution of the inversion problem in a rotating frame is composed of a\npulse sequence of maximum intensity and is similar to the optimal solution for\ninverting only one spin by using a non-resonant control field in the laboratory\nframe. An example is implemented experimentally using techniques of Nuclear\nMagnetic Resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 15:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Due to the difficulty\nand subjectivity of human interpretation, automated analysis of dermoscopy\nimages has become an important research area. Border detection is often the\nfirst step in this analysis. Methods: In this article, we present an\napproximate lesion localization method that serves as a preprocessing step for\ndetecting borders in dermoscopy images. In this method, first the black frame\naround the image is removed using an iterative algorithm. The approximate\nlocation of the lesion is then determined using an ensemble of thresholding\nalgorithms. Results: The method is tested on a set of 428 dermoscopy images.\nThe localization error is quantified by a metric that uses dermatologist\ndetermined borders as the ground truth. Conclusion: The results demonstrate\nthat the method presented here achieves both fast and accurate localization of\nlesions in dermoscopy images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 11:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-08"}
