As the\nlong-wavelength perturbations remain small even when the short-scale dynamics\nare non-linear, the tools of linear perturbation theory may be applied. The\nwork in [arXiv:1004.2488] deals only with matter in the form of a pressureless\nperfect fluid with zero anisotropic stress, and also assumes that the\nshort-scale gravitational dynamics are Newtonian. In this work we extend this\nformalism to the case of a perfect fluid with pressure, and in particular to\nthe case of preheating after inflation, where the matter content of the\nuniverse can be modeled by two coupled scalar fields. We discard the assumption\nthat the short-scale gravitational dynamics are Newtonian.

More precisely, it follows from the Stratification Theorem of\nGoodearl and Letzter that the primitive spectrum of $U_q[w]$ admits a\nstratification indexed by those primes that are invariant under a natural torus\naction. Moreover each stratum is homeomorphic to the spectrum of maximal ideals\nof a torus.

However, 4DCT simulation is associated with\nmuch higher imaging dose than conventional CT simulation, which is a major\nconcern in its clinical application. Conventionally, each phase of 4DCT is\nreconstructed independently using the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm.\nThe basic idea of our new algorithm is that, by utilizing the common\ninformation among different phases, the input information required to\nreconstruct image of high quality, and thus the imaging dose, can be reduced.\nWe proposed a temporal non-local means (TNLM) method to explore the inter-phase\nsimilarity. All phases of the 4DCT images are reconstructed simultaneously by\nminimizing a cost function consisting of a data fidelity term and a TNLM\nregularization term.

It is\noften believed that synchronous motion is the most probable outcome of the\ntidal evolution process, since synchronous rotation is observed for the\nmajority of the satellites in the Solar System. However, in the 19th century,\nSchiaparelli also assumed synchronous motion for the rotations of Mercury and\nVenus, and was later shown to be wrong. Rather, for planets in eccentric orbits\nsynchronous rotation is very unlikely. The rotation period and axial tilt of\nexoplanets is still unknown, but a large number of planets have been detected\nclose to the parent star and should have evolved to a final equilibrium\nsituation. Therefore, based on the Solar System well studied cases, we can make\nsome predictions for exoplanets.

Gravitational energy fluctuations -- gravitons -- are\nresponsible for elastic scattering of subatomic particles. Such scattering\ncorresponds to complimentary force -- graviton scattering force -- arising in\ngravitational interaction in addition to Newtonian gravity. The strength of the\ngraviton scattering force is proportional to the graviton scattering\nprobability. Unlike Newtonian gravity the graviton scattering force follows the\n1/r law and dominates the former on cosmological scale in the limit of low\norbital accelerations. Similarly to Modified Newtonian Dynamics the quantum\ngravity accounts for variations in observed M/L ratios of diverse stellar\nsystems ranging from dwarf spheroid galaxies to X-ray galaxy clusters without\nrequiring an invisible matter (which is still required by MOND in X-Ray cluster\ncores). Unlike MOND the presented theory neither violates cornerstone Newton\nLaws nor suffers from the ambiguity of acceleration frames while enjoying vast\nexperimental evidence usually cited in favor of MOND. To ascertain the validity\nof the presented theory I have examined the predictions of quantum gravity for\ndwarf spheroid, ordinary and giant elliptic galaxies, and X-ray clusters. In\nall cases quantum gravity yields M/L ratios and scaling relations consistent\nwith observations. Quantum gravity accounts for the tilt of the Fundamental\nPlane of elliptical galaxies erasing the differences in M/L vs. luminosity\nrelations for faint and bright ellipticals, which cannot be easily explained by\nCDM model. Lastly, by analyzing the behavior of the gravitational energy\nfluctuations in the limit of high matter density expected in the early Universe\nI show that primordial inflation and dark energy (i.e. non-zero cosmological\nconstant) arise as natural effects of quantum gravity in the expanding\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 19:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-08"}

For example, by assuming for it a solar (MX =M_Sun) or brown\ndwarf mass (MX = 80mJup), now at not less than dX = 11-6 kau (1 kau=1000\nastronomical units), v would be of the order of 6-10% and 3-5% of the speed of\nlight c, respectively. By assuming larger present-day distances for X, on the\nbasis of the lacking of direct observational evidences of electromagnetic\norigin for it, its speed would be even higher. Instead, the fastest solitary\nmassive objects known so far, like hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and supernova\nremnants (SRs), travel at v = 0.002-0.005c, having acquired so huge velocities\nin some of the most violent astrophysical phenomena like interactions with\nsupermassive galactic black holes and supernova explosions. It turns out that\nthe orbit of the Earth would not be macroscopically altered by a close (0.2 au)\npassage of such an ultrafast body X in the next 2 yr.

The analysis reveals a subtle interplay between\ncoherent and incoherent phenomena and demonstrating that dynamics analogous to\nevolution due to QZE or AZE can be generated from stochastic sequences of\nunitary pulses when averaged over all possible realizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 20:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

For this class of flows, different finite\nelement method (FEM) implementations have been proposed in the literature and\nthese are seen to produce apparently contradictory results. The purpose of this\npaper is to develop a robust framework for the FEM simulation of these flows\nand then, by performing numerical experiments, provide guidelines for future\ninvestigations. In the new framework, the boundary conditions on the\nliquid-solid interface are implemented in a methodologically similar way to\nthose on the free surface so that the equations at the contact line, where the\ninterfaces meet, are applied without any ad-hoc alterations. The new\nimplementation removes the need for complex rotations of the momentum\nequations, usually required to apply boundary conditions normal and tangent to\nthe solid surface. The developed code allows the convergence of the solution to\nbe studied as the spatial resolution of the computational mesh is varied over\nmany orders of magnitude. This makes it possible to provide practical\nrecommendations on the spatial resolution required by a numerical scheme for a\ngiven set of non-dimensional similarity parameters.

Luminosity functions in the z, H, and Ks\nbands show a faint-end slope consistent with being flat, and a characteristic\nmagnitude M* close to passive evolution predictions of M* of local massive\nclusters, with a formation redshift z>2. The color-magnitude and color-mass\ndiagrams show evidence of a tight red sequence of massive galaxies, with\noverall old stellar populations, generally early-type morphology, typically\nshowing early-type spectral features and rest-frame far-UV emission consistent\nwith very low star formation rates (SFR<0.2Msun/yr). Star forming spectroscopic\nmembers, with SFRs of up to ~100Msun/yr, are all located at clustercentric\ndistances >~250kpc, with the central cluster region already appearing\neffectively quenched. Massive galaxies in the core of this cluster appear to be\nin an advanced evolutionary stage in terms of both star formation and mass\nassembly. The high-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function is essentially\nalready in place, and the stellar mass fraction estimated within r500 (~1%,\nKroupa IMF) is already similar to that of local massive clusters. On the other\nhand, morphological analysis of the massive red sequence galaxies suggests that\nthey are smaller than similarly massive local early-types. While possibly\naffected by systematics and biases, this result might imply that, in spite of\nthe overall early assembly of these sources, their evolution is not complete,\nand processes like minor (and likely dry) merging might still shape their\nstructural properties to resemble those of their local counterparts, without\nsubstantially affecting their stellar mass or host stellar\npopulations.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 23:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

My interest in the product $\\prod_{k=1}^n \\sin\nk\\theta/2$ has inspired me to become acquainted with Euler's papers on\ntrigonometric identities, in particular E447, E561, and E562. E561 says nothing\nabout the product $\\prod_{k=1}^n \\sin k\\theta/2$, but it has identities which I\nhad not seen before. The identities have a form similar to Vi\\`ete's infinite\nproduct $\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\cos \\theta/2^k=\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\theta}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 02:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

This is because the perturbations induced by the planetary\ncaustic are unpredictable, thus making it difficult to carry out strategic\nobservations. However, if future high-cadence monitoring surveys are conducted,\nthe majority of planetary caustic events including the events by free-floating\nplanets and wide-separation planets would be detected. Hence, understanding the\nplanetary caustic perturbations becomes important. In this paper, we\ninvestigate in detail the pattern of the planetary caustic perturbations. From\nthis study, we find three properties of the planetary caustic perturbations.\nFirst, planetary systems with the same star-planet separation (s) basically\nproduce perturbations of constant strength regardless of the planet/star mass\nratio (q), but the duration of each perturbation scales with sqrt{q}. Second,\nclose planetary systems with the same separation produce essentially the same\nnegative perturbations between two triangular-shaped caustics regardless of q,\nbut the duration of the perturbations scales with sqrt{q}. Third, the positive\nperturbations for planetary systems with the same mass ratio become stronger as\nthe caustic shrinks with the increasing |log s|, while the negative\nperturbations become weaker. We estimate the degeneracy in the determination of\nq that occurs in planetary caustic events. From this, we find that the mass\nratio can be more precisely determined as q increases and |log s| decreases. We\nalso find that the degeneracy range of events for which the source star passes\nclose to the planetary caustic is usually very narrow, and thus it would not\nsignificantly affect the determination of q.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 05:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Most prior work on finding the transmission\ncapacity of ad-hoc networks has focused only on one-way communication where a\nsource communicates with a destination and no data is sent from the destination\nto the source. In practice, however, two-way or bidirectional data transmission\nis required to support control functions like packet acknowledgements and\nchannel feedback. This paper extends the concept of transmission capacity to\ntwo-way wireless ad-hoc networks by incorporating the concept of a two-way\noutage with different rate requirements in both directions. Tight upper and\nlower bounds on the two-way transmission capacity are derived for frequency\ndivision duplexing. The derived bounds are used to derive the optimal solution\nfor bidirectional bandwidth allocation that maximizes the two-way transmission\ncapacity, which is shown to perform better than allocating bandwidth\nproportional to the desired rate in both directions. Using the proposed two-way\ntransmission capacity framework, a lower bound on the two-way transmission\ncapacity with transmit beamforming using limited feedback is derived as a\nfunction of bandwidth, and bits allocated for feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 06:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

Answering the first question we solve the\nmodified BK equation which takes into account energy conservation. In spite of\nthe fact that we used the simplified kernel, we believe that the main result of\nthe paper: the small ($\\leq 40%$) suppression of the inclusive productiondue to\nenergy conservation, reflects a general feature. This result leads us to\nbelieve that the small value of the nuclear modification factor is of a\nnon-perturbative nature.

With seven years of data, we\nclearly show that quasar image A is affected by strong microlensing variations\nand that the time delays are best expressed relative to quasar image B. We\nmeasured Delta_t(BC) = 7.8+/-0.8 days, Delta_t(BD) = -6.5+/-0.7 days and\nDelta_t_CD = -14.3+/-0.8 days. We spacially deconvolved HST NICMOS2 F160W\nimages to derive accurate astrometry of the quasar images and to infer the\nlight profile of the lensing galaxy. We combined these images with a stellar\npopulation fitting of a deep VLT spectrum of the lensing galaxy to estimate the\nbaryonic fraction, $f_b$, in the Einstein radius. We measured f_b =\n0.65+0.13-0.10 if the lensing galaxy has a Salpeter IMF and f_b =\n0.45+0.04-0.07 if it has a Kroupa IMF. The spectrum also allowed us to estimate\nthe velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, sigma_ap = 222+/-34 km/s. We\nused f_b and sigma_ap to constrain an analytical model of the lensing galaxy\ncomposed of an Hernquist plus generalized NFW profile. We solve the Jeans\nequations numerically for the model and explored the parameter space under the\nadditional requirement that the model must predict the correct astrometry for\nthe quasar images. Given the current error bars on f_b and sigma_ap, we did not\nconstrain H0 yet with high accuracy, i.e., we found a broad range of models\nwith chi^2 < 1. However, narrowing this range is possible, provided a better\nvelocity dispersion measurement becomes available. In addition, increasing the\ndepth of the current HST imaging data of HE 0435-1223 will allow us to combine\nour constraints with lens reconstruction techniques that make use of the full\nEinstein ring that is visible in this object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 08:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2011 14:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In three dimensions, the critical exponents for\nXY and Heisenberg spins display strong dependences on the parameters of the\nresummation procedure and on the loop order.

As a consequence, their removal from the\nsky maps represents a critical step in the analysis of the CMB data. Before\nremoving a source, however, it is necessary to detect it and source extraction\nconsists of a delicate preliminary operation. In the literature, various\ntechniques have been presented to detect point-sources in the sky maps. The\nmost sophisticated ones exploit the multi-frequency nature of the observations\nthat is typical of the CMB experiments. These techniques have \"optimal\"\ntheoretical properties and, at least in principle, are capable of remarkable\nperformances. Actually, they are rather difficult to use and this deteriorates\nthe quality of the obtainable results. In this paper, we present a new\ntechnique, the \"weighted matched filter\" (WMF), that is quite simple to use and\nhence more robust in practical applications. Such technique shows particular\nefficiency in the detection of sources whose spectra have a slope different\nfrom zero. We apply this method to three Southern Hemisphere sky regions - each\nwith an area of 400 square degrees - of the seven years Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP) maps and compare the resulting sources with those of\nthe two seven-year WMAP point-sources catalogues. In these selected regions we\nfind seven additional sources not previously listed in WMAP catalogues and\ndiscuss their most likely identification and spectral properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 09:57:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 08:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Minton & Malhotra\n(2009) showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main belt\ncan be reproduced by an exponentially-decaying migration of the giant planets\non a time scale of tau ~ 0.5My. However, self-consistent numerical simulations\nshow that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets is\ninconsistent with an exponential change in their semi major axes on such a\nshort time scale (Hahn & Malhotra, 1999). In fact, the typical time scale is\ntau > 5My. When giant planet migration on this time scale is applied to the\nasteroid belt, the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with the\nobserved one. However, the planet migration can be significantly sped up by\nplanet-planet encounters. Consider an evolution where both Jupiter and Saturn\nhave close encounters with a Neptune-mass planet (presumably Uranus or Neptune\nthemselves) and where this third planet, after being scattered inwards by\nSaturn, is scattered outwards by Jupiter. This scenario leads to a very rapid\nincrease in the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn that we show here\nto have only mild effects on the structure of asteroid belt. This type of\nevolution is called a jumping-Jupiter case.

In\nparticular, a well-designed sensing matrix can reduce the coherence between the\natoms of the equivalent dictionary, and as a consequence, reduce the\nreconstruction error. In some applications, the signals of interest can be well\napproximated by a union of a small number of subspaces (e.g., face recognition\nand motion segmentation). This implies the existence of a dictionary which\nleads to block-sparse representations. In this work, we propose a framework for\nsensing matrix design that improves the ability of block-sparse approximation\ntechniques to reconstruct and classify signals. This method is based on\nminimizing a weighted sum of the inter-block coherence and the sub-block\ncoherence of the equivalent dictionary. Our experiments show that the proposed\nalgorithm significantly improves signal recovery and classification ability of\nthe Block-OMP algorithm compared to sensing matrix optimization methods that do\nnot employ block structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 13:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-09"}

The\nhighly (up to 100%) circularly polarized nature and high brightness temperature\nof the emission has been interpreted as an effective amplification mechanism of\nthe high-frequency electromagnetic waves, the electron cyclotron maser\ninstability (ECMI). In order to understand the magnetic topology and the\nproperties of the radio emitting region and associated plasmas in these\nultracool dwarfs and interpret the origin of radio pulses and their radiation\nmechanism, we built an active region model, based on the rotation of the UCD\nand the ECMI mechanism.

The extensive simultaneous velocity\ncoverage of the observations, >500 km/s, ensures that we can probe the\nconditions of both the warm, dense gas of the molecular cloud Sgr B2 near the\nGalactic centre, and the more diffuse gas in the Galactic disk clouds along the\nline-of-sight. We present ground-state NH3 absorption in seven distinct\nvelocity features along the line-of-sight towards Sgr B2. We find a nearly\nlinear correlation between the column densities of NH3 and CS, and a\nsquare-root relation to N2H+. The ammonia abundance in these diffuse Galactic\ndisk clouds is estimated to be about (0.5-1)e-8, similar to that observed for\ndiffuse clouds in the outer Galaxy. On the basis of the detection of H218O\nabsorption in the 3 kpc arm, and the absence of such a feature in the H217O\nspectrum, we conclude that the water abundance is around 1e-7, compared to\n~1e-8 for NH3. The Sgr B2 molecular cloud itself is seen in absorption in NH3,\n15NH3, H2O, H218O, and H217O, with emission superimposed on the absorption in\nthe main isotopologues. The non-LTE excitation of NH3 in the environment of Sgr\nB2 can be explained without invoking an unusually hot (500 K) molecular layer.\nA hot layer is similarly not required to explain the line profiles of the\n1_{1,0}-1_{0,1} transition from H2O and its isotopologues. The relatively weak\n15NH3 absorption in the Sgr B2 molecular cloud indicates a high [14N/15N]\nisotopic ratio >600. The abundance ratio of H218O and H217O is found to be\nrelatively low, 2.5--3.

The text-book example of far-field\ninterference at a grating is compared with diffraction into the dark field\nbehind an opaque aperture, commonly designated as Poisson's spot or the spot of\nArago. Our estimates indicate that both phenomena may still be observed in a\nmass range exceeding present-day experiments by at least two orders of\nmagnitude. They both require, however, the development of sufficiently cold,\nintense and coherent cluster beams. While the observation of Poisson's spot\noffers the advantage of non-dispersiveness and a simple distinction between\nclassical and quantum fringes in the absence of particle wall interactions, van\nder Waals forces may severely limit the distinguishability between genuine\nquantum wave diffraction and classically explicable spots already for\nmoderately polarizable objects and diffraction elements as thin as 100 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 15:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

The anomalous advancement of the apside line that is customarily\naccounted by the theory of general relativity, is ascribed to the gravitational\neffect due to the entire Universe. When the least action is written in the\nSun's frame of reference, the residual rotation is seen to stem from inertia\ndue to all bodies in the Universe. Since mass corresponds to a bound form of\nenergy, gravity, as any other force, can be described as an energy density\ndifference between a system of bodies and its surrounding energy densities that\nare dispersed throughout the Universe. According to the principle of least\naction the Universe is expanding by combustion of mass to radiation in the\nquest of equilibrating the bound forms of energy with \"zero-density\nsurroundings\" in least time.

The frequency distribution of the output power can\nbe accounted for by convolution transformations of the dc current vortex\nwaveform, and the current modulation.
