Naturally, the energy density and the spacetime\ncurvature have a delta-like singularity at the apex of the conical defect, but\nthat doesn't give rise to any unphysical situations. Since the conical solution\nimplies the presence of a source, applying reverse enginnering, one can\nidentify the coupling term that is required in the action to account for that\nsource. In that way, a relation is established between the identification\noperation that gives rise to the topological defect and the interaction term in\nthe action that produces it. This idea has a natural extension to higher\ndimensions, where instead of a point particle (zero-brane) one finds membranes\nof even spatial dimensions (p-branes, with p=2n).

The\ncontroller choice is based on the cross-correlation between pilot symbols over\ntwo consecutive time instants (which is considered to be a suitable measure of\nchannel stationarity) as well as the deviation from the desired BER. Simulation\nresults of the system performance confirm the effectiveness of this new channel\nestimation technique over traditional non-adaptive estimation methods in\nincreasing the data rate of OFDM symbols while maintaining the same probability\nof error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 18:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-23"}

Most\ncurrent designs are based on the multi-fingered hand, but this approach\nintroduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of\ncontrollable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled\nsecurely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how\nmuch stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a\ncompletely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are\nreplaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target\nobject, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum\nthe granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the\nobject without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less\nthan 0.5% suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding\nmany times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of\ngranular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a\njammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms,\nfriction, suction and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force.\nUsing a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the\njammed state. This opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet\nhighly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 18:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 20:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The additional magnetic flux is supplied by the adjacent region\nof emerging magnetic flux: As emerging bipole separate, the poles of the spot\npolarity migrate towards the spot, and finally merge with it. As more and more\nflux is accumulated, a penumbra forms. From inversions we infer maps for the\nmagnetic field and the Doppler velocity (being constant along the\nline-of-sight).

We propose a conceptual explanation of this finding and illustrate it\nusing a simple model in which metabolic and regulatory networks of prokaryotes\nare shaped by horizontal gene transfer of coregulated metabolic pathways.\nAdapting to a new environmental condition monitored by a new transcription\nfactor (e.g., learning to use another nutrient) involves both acquiring new\nenzymes and reusing some of the enzymes already encoded in the genome. As the\nrepertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse\nits enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each\nnew task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of\nfunctional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the\ntotal number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because\nof a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its\nregulator and all enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple\nmodels of network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and\nreproducing the empirically observed quadratic scaling.

Toolbox\nmodel was recently proposed to explain this scaling for metabolic enzymes and\ntheir regulators. According to its rules the metabolic network of an organism\nevolves by horizontal transfer of pathways from other species. These pathways\nare part of a larger \"universal\" network formed by the union of all\nspecies-specific networks. It remained to be understood, however, how the\ntopological properties of this universal network influence the scaling law of\nfunctional content of genomes. In this study we answer this question by first\nanalyzing the scaling properties of the toolbox model on arbitrary tree-like\nuniversal networks. We mathematically prove that the critical branching\ntopology, in which the average number of upstream neighbors of a node is equal\nto one, is both necessary and sufficient for the quadratic scaling. Conversely,\nthe toolbox model on trees with exponentially expanding, supercritical topology\nis characterized by the linear scaling with logarithmic corrections. We further\ngeneralize our model to include reactions with multiple substrates/products as\nwell as branched or cyclic metabolic pathways. Unlike the original model the\nnew version employs evolutionary optimized pathways with the smallest number of\nreactions necessary to achieve their metabolic tasks. Numerical simulations of\nthis most realistic model on the universal network from the KEGG database again\nproduced approximately quadratic scaling. Our results demonstrate why, in spite\nof their \"small-world\" topology, real-life metabolic networks are characterized\nby a broad distribution of pathway lengths and sizes of metabolic regulons in\nregulatory networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 21:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}

The corresponding cross section at the LHC can be as large\nas a factor of 10 times the SM result for extreme values of the coupling. The\ndetection of such an effect could in principle lead to important information\nabout the hidden sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 22:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 19:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2011 19:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-10"}

In this paper we\nfirst propose an architecture for an AN where airborne networking platforms\n(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. In this\narchitecture, the ANPs can be viewed as mobile base stations and the combat\naircrafts on a mission as mobile clients. The combat aircrafts on a mission\nmove through a space called air corridor. The goal of the AN design is to form\na backbone network with the ANPs with two properties: (i) the backbone network\nremains connected at all times, even though the topology of the network changes\nwith the movement of the ANPs, and (ii) the entire 3D space of the air corridor\nis under radio coverage at all times by the continuously moving ANPs.\n  In addition to proposing an architecture for an AN, the contributions of the\npaper include, development of an algorithm that finds the velocity and\ntransmission range of the ANPs so that the dynamically changing backbone\nnetwork remains connected at all times, development of a routing algorithm that\nensures a connection between the source-destination node pair with the fewest\nnumber of path switching, given the dimensions of the air corridor and the\nradius of the coverage sphere associated with an ANP, development of an\nalgorithm that finds the fewest number of ANPs required to provide complete\ncoverage of the air corridor at all times, development of an algorithm that\nprovides connected-coverage to the air corridor at all times, and development\nof a visualization tool that depicts the movement patterns of the ANPs and the\nresulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 23:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both\nkinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a\ncharacteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close\nto the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy\nformation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this interpretation\nis to understand the selection biases that limit our ability to detect the\nlowest mass galaxies. The least massive satellite halos are likely to host\nstealth galaxies with very-low surface brightness and this may be an important\nlimitation in the hunt for low-mass fossils from the epoch of reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 00:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}

(2009) of\nplanetesimal-driven migration using our N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al.,\n1998). The previous work focused on the case of a single planet of mass Mem,\nimmersed in a planetesimal disk with a power-law surface density distribution\nand Rayleigh distributed eccentricities and inclinations. Typically 10^4-10^5\nequal-mass planetesimals were used, where the gravitational force (and the\nback-reaction) on each planetesimal by the Sun and planetwere included, while\nplanetesimal-planetesimal interactions were neglected. The runs reported on\nhere incorporate the dynamical effects of a gas disk, where the Adachi et al.\n(1976) prescription of aerodynamic gas drag is implemented for all bodies. In\nsome cases the Papaloizou and Larwood (2000) prescription of Type-I migration\nfor the planet are implemented, as well as a mass distribution. In the gas-free\ncases, rapid planet migration was observed - at a rate independent of the\nplanet's mass - provided the planet's mass was not large compared to the mass\nin planetesimals capable of entering its Hill sphere. In such cases, both\ninward and outward migrations can be self-sustaining, but there is a strong\npropensity for inward migration. When a gas disk is present, aerodynamic drag\ncan substantially modify the dynamics of scattered planetesimals. For\nsufficiently large or small mono-dispersed planetesimals, the planet typically\nmigrates inward. However, for a range of plausible planetesimal sizes (i.e.\n0.5-5.0 km at 5.0 AU in a minimum mass Hayashi disk) outward migration is\nusually triggered, often accompanied by substantial planetary mass accretion.\nThe origins of this behaviour are explained in terms of a toy model. The\neffects of including a size distribution and torques associated with Type-I\nmigration are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 06:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}

In agreement with the results by other research groups, we\nfind that the O-Ne core is formed via the formation of a convective flame that\nproceeds to the centre of the star. The evolution which follows is strongly\ndetermined by the description of the mass loss mechanism. Use of the\ntraditional formalism with the super-wind phase favours a long evolution with\nmany thermal pulses, and the achievement of an advanced nucleosynthesis, due\nthe large temperatures reached by the bottom of the external mantle.

Understanding the\nemergence of such structured units out of the complex network of biochemical\ninteractions between bone cells is essential to extend our fundamental\nknowledge of normal bone physiology and its disorders. To this end, we propose\na spatio-temporal continuum model that integrates some of the most important\ninteraction pathways currently known to exist between cells of the osteoblastic\nand osteoclastic lineage. This mathematical model allows us to test the\nsignificance and completeness of these pathways based on their ability to\nreproduce the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual BMUs. We show that under\nsuitable conditions, the experimentally-observed structured cell distribution\nof cortical BMUs is retrieved. The proposed model admits travelling-wave-like\nsolutions for the cell densities with tightly organised profiles, corresponding\nto the progression of a single remodelling BMU.

Rotational mixing changes the global\nproperties of a solar-type star with a significant increase of the effective\ntemperature resulting in a shift of the evolutionary track to the blue part of\nthe HR diagram. These differences are related to changes of the chemical\ncomposition, because rotational mixing counteracts the effects of atomic\ndiffusion leading to larger helium surface abundances for rotating models than\nfor non-rotating ones. Higher values of the large frequency separation are then\nfound for rotating models than for non-rotating ones at the same evolutionary\nstage, because the increase of the effective temperature leads to a smaller\nradius and hence to an increase of the stellar mean density. Rotational mixing\nalso has a considerable impact on the structure and chemical composition of the\ncentral stellar layers by bringing fresh hydrogen fuel to the core, thereby\nenhancing the main-sequence lifetime. The increase of the central hydrogen\nabundance together with the change of the chemical profiles in the central\nlayers result in a significant increase of the values of the small frequency\nseparations and of the ratio of the small to large separations for models\nincluding shellular rotation. This increase is clearly seen for models with the\nsame age sharing the same initial parameters except for the inclusion of\nrotation as well as for models with the same global stellar parameters and in\nparticular the same location in the HR diagram. By computing rotating models of\nsolar-type stars including the effects of a dynamo that possibly occurs in the\nradiative zone, we find that the efficiency of rotational mixing is strongly\nreduced when the effects of magnetic fields are taken into account, in contrast\nto what happens in massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 08:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This model is sampled while the robot is tracking reference\ntrajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear\nleast-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. The efficiency of this\nmethod has been proved through the experimental identification of many\nprototypes and industrial robots. However, this method requires the joint\nforce/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity\nand acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high\nsampling rates. The proposed new method requires only the joint force/torque\nmeasurement. It is a closed-loop output error method where the usual joint\nposition output is replaced by the joint force/torque. It is based on a\nclosed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same\nstructure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the\nactual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of\nthe error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. This\nis a non-linear least-squares problem which is dramatically simplified using\nthe inverse dynamic model to obtain an analytical expression of the simulated\nforce/torque, linear in the parameters.

But it is very difficult to control the initial data\ndistribution because every user has the freedom to share any data with other\nusers. The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across\nmultiple servers which is proposed by replication. The large scale content\ndistribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.\nThe demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the\nsource of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access\nlatency and the network traffic. In addition to this, due to the intrinsic\ndynamism of the P2P environment, static data distribution cannot be expected to\nguarantee good load balancing. If the hot peers become bottleneck, it leads to\nincreased user response time and significant performance degradation of the\nsystem. Hence an effective load balancing mechanism is necessary in such cases\nand it can be attained efficiently by intelligent data replication. In this\npaper, we propose a cluster based replication architecture for load-balancing\nin peer-to-peer content distribution systems. In addition to an intelligent\nreplica placement technique, it also consists of an effective load balancing\ntechnique. In the intelligent replica placement technique, peers are grouped\ninto strong and weak clusters based on their weight vector which comprises\navailable capacity, CPU speed, access latency and memory size. In order to\nachieve complete load balancing across the system, an intracluster and\ninter-cluster load balancing algorithms are proposed. We are able to show that\nour proposed architecture attains less latency and better throughput with\nreduced bandwidth usage, through the simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 10:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}

In 2009 we collected 9 light curves of 8\ntransits of the exoplanet WASP-10b.

It thus offers the opportunity to check our\nunderstanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars in a cluster\nenvironment. We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution,\nR~50,000, of the potentially best solar twin, M67-1194, identified among\nsolar-like stars in M67. Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates\nperformed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al. (2008), we explore the\nchemical-abundance similarities and differences between M67-1194 and the Sun,\nusing VLT/FLAMES-UVES. Working with a solar twin in the framework of a\ndifferential analysis, we minimize systematic model errors in the abundance\nanalysis compared to previous studies which utilized more evolved stars to\ndetermine the metallicity of M67. We find M67-1194 to have stellar parameters\nindistinguishable from the solar values, with the exception of the overall\nmetallicity which is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.023 +/- 0.015). An age\ndetermination based on evolutionary tracks yields 4.2 +/- 1.6Gyr. Most\nsurprisingly, we find the chemical abundance pattern to closely resemble the\nsolar one, in contrast to most known solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. We\nconfirm the solar-twin nature of M67-1194, the first solar twin known to belong\nto a stellar association. This fact allows us to put some constraints on the\nphysical reasons for the seemingly systematic departure of M67-1194 and the Sun\nfrom most known solar twins regarding chemical composition. We find that\nradiative dust cleansing by nearby luminous stars may be the explanation for\nthe peculiar composition of both the Sun and M67-1194, but alternative\nexplanations are also possible. The chemical similarity between the Sun and\nM67-1194 also suggests that the Sun once formed in a cluster like M67.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 11:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We study prior-free revenue\nmaximization for a seller with unlimited supply of n item types facing m myopic\nbuyers present for k < log n days. For the static (k = 1) case, Balcan et al.\n[2] show that one random item price (the same on each item) yields revenue\nwithin a \\Theta(log m + log n) factor of optimum and this factor is tight. We\ndefine the hereditary maximizers property of buyer valuations (satisfied by any\nmulti-unit or gross substitutes valuation) that is sufficient for a significant\nimprovement of the approximation factor in the dynamic (k > 1) setting. Our\nmain result is a non-increasing, randomized, schedule of k equal item prices\nwith expected revenue within a O((log m + log n) / k) factor of optimum for\nprivate valuations with hereditary maximizers.

We propose a\ncode construction method using two edge type LDPC codes based on the coset\nencoding scheme. Using a standard LDPC ensemble with a given threshold over the\nBEC, we give a construction for a two edge type LDPC ensemble with the same\nthreshold. If the given standard LDPC ensemble has degree two variable nodes,\nour construction gives rise to degree one variable nodes in the code used over\nthe main channel. This results in zero threshold over the main channel. In\norder to circumvent this problem, we numerically optimize the degree\ndistribution of the two edge type LDPC ensemble. We find that the resulting\nensembles are able to perform close to the boundary of the rate-equivocation\nregion of the wiretap channel.\n  There are two performance criteria for a coding scheme used over a wiretap\nchannel: reliability and secrecy. The reliability measure corresponds to the\nprobability of decoding error for the intended receiver. This can be easily\nmeasured using density evolution recursion. However, it is more challenging to\ncharacterize secrecy, corresponding to the equivocation of the message for the\nwiretapper. M\\'easson, Montanari, and Urbanke have shown how the equivocation\ncan be measured for a broad range of standard LDPC ensembles for transmission\nover the BEC under the point-to-point setup.

Observations in\nthe 1990's with OSSE/CGRO showed that the emission is strongly concentrated\ntowards the Galactic bulge. In the 2000's, the SPI instrument aboard ESA's\nINTEGRAL gamma-ray observatory allowed scientists to measure that emission\nacross the entire Galaxy, revealing that the bulge/disk luminosity ratio is\nlarger than observed in any other wavelength. This mapping prompted a number of\nnovel explanations, including rather \"exotic ones (e.g. dark matter\nannihilation). However, conventional astrophysical sources, like type Ia\nsupernovae, microquasars or X-ray binaries, are still plausible candidates for\na large fraction of the observed total 511 keV emission of the bulge. A closer\nstudy of the subject reveals new layers of complexity, since positrons may\npropagate far away from their production sites, making it difficult to infer\nthe underlying source distribution from the observed map of 511 keV emission.\nHowever, contrary to the rather well understood propagation of high energy\n(>GeV) particles of Galactic cosmic rays, understanding the propagation of low\nenergy (~MeV) positrons in the turbulent, magnetized interstellar medium, still\nremains a formidable challenge.

However, there is a potential transition phase (which we\ncall the \"snowball phase\"), between the formation of the first planetesimals\nand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either\nignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated\nplanetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion\nof sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a\nsimplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the\ndust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before\nmutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number\nof critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the\nplanetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. For systems\nin which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and\nwith relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can be\nvery important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass\nbefore mutual collisions take over. In such cases, the snowball growth phase\ncan be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals.\nMoreover, such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of a\nprotoplanetary gas disk. A noteworthy result is that ... ...(see the paper).\nFor the specific case of close binaries such as Alpha Centauri ... ... (see the\npaper). From a more general perspective, these preliminary results suggest that\nan efficient snowball growth phase provides a large amount of \"room at the\nbottom\" for theories of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 15:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The first part\ndeals with the decomposition of multiple coverings of the plane. We say that a\nplanar set is cover-decomposable if there is a constant m such that any m-fold\ncovering of the plane with its translates is decomposable into two disjoint\ncoverings of the whole plane. Pach conjectured that every convex set is\ncover-decomposable. We verify his conjecture for polygons. Moreover, if m is\nlarge enough, we prove that any m-fold covering can even be decomposed into k\ncoverings. Then we show that the situation is exactly the opposite in 3\ndimensions, for any polyhedron and any $m$ we construct an m-fold covering of\nthe space that is not decomposable. We also give constructions that show that\nconcave polygons are usually not cover-decomposable. We start the first part\nwith a detailed survey of all results on the cover-decomposability of polygons.\n  The second part investigates another geometric partition problem, related to\nplanar representation of graphs. The slope number of a graph G is the smallest\nnumber s with the property that G has a straight-line drawing with edges of at\nmost s distinct slopes and with no bends. We examine the slope number of\nbounded degree graphs. Our main results are that if the maximum degree is at\nleast 5, then the slope number tends to infinity as the number of vertices\ngrows but every graph with maximum degree at most 3 can be embedded with only\nfive slopes. We also prove that such an embedding exists for the related notion\ncalled slope parameter. Finally, we study the planar slope number, defined only\nfor planar graphs as the smallest number s with the property that the graph has\na straight-line drawing in the plane without any crossings such that the edges\nare segments of only s distinct slopes. We show that the planar slope number of\nplanar graphs with bounded degree is bounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 15:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 07:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-27"}

Recently numerical studies have\nshown, however, that for 1D Bethe-integrable models the simulation of local\noperators in the Heisenberg picture can be efficient as the corresponding\noperator-space entanglement grows only logarithmically. Using the spin-1/2 XX\nchain as generic example of an integrabel model that can be mapped to free\nparticles, we here provide a simple explanation for this. We show furthermore\nthat the same reduction of complexity applies to operators that have a\nhigh-temperature auto correlation function which decays slower than\nexponential, i.e., with a power law. This is amongst others the case for models\nwhere the Blombergen-De Gennes conjecture of high-temperature diffusive\ndynamics holds.
