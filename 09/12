We use a sample of\n~ 1.7 x 10^5 galaxies from the SDSS DR7 at redshift smaller than 0.33. We apply\nconservative photometric and spectroscopic cuts to select galaxies with\nphysical properties similar to those of the lenses studied in the SLACS Survey.\nThe values of the galaxy stellar and total mass projected inside a cylinder of\nradius equal to the effective radius are obtained, respectively, by fitting the\nSDSS multicolor photometry with stellar population synthesis models, under the\nassumption of a Chabrier stellar IMF, and adopting a one-component isothermal\ntotal mass model with effective velocity dispersion approximated by the central\nstellar velocity dispersion. We find that within the effective radius the\nstellar mass estimates differ from the total ones by only a relatively constant\nproportionality factor. In detail, we observe that the values of the projected\nfraction of dark over total mass and the logarithmic values of the central\nsurface dark matter density (measured in M_{Sun} kpc^{-2}) have almost Gaussian\nprobability distribution functions, with median values of 0.64^{+0.08}_{-0.11}\nand 9.1^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, respectively. Our results disfavor an interpretation of\nthe tilt of the FP in terms of differences in the galaxy dark matter content\nand give useful information on the possible variations of the galaxy stellar\nIMF and dark matter density profile. Finally, we provide some observational\nevidence on the likely significant contribution of dry minor mergers, feedback\nfrom active galactic nuclei, and/or coalescence of binary black holes on the\nformation and evolution of massive early-type galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2010 16:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A brief outline of\nthe approach is provided in natural language. Two specific models of tumor\nresponse to chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic schemes are briefly outlined\nand indicative results are presented in order to exemplify the application\npotential of the method.

The critical current density and the\nability to trap high magnetic flux inside the sample depend largely on the\nquality of the GBs. Zn has the ability to pin vortices but it also degrades\nsuperconductivity. In this study we have investigated the effect of Zn impurity\non the intergrain coupling properties in high-quality La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4\nsintered samples with different hole concentrations, p (\\equiv x), over a wide\nrange of Zn contents (y) using field-dependent ac susceptibility (ACS)\nmeasurements.

Next, we provide a bound on the performance\nachievable using any specific sampling approach. Essential differences between\nthe noisy and noise-free cases arise from this analysis. In particular, we\nidentify settings in which noise-free recovery techniques deteriorate\nsubstantially under slight noise levels, thus quantifying the numerical\ninstability inherent in such methods. This instability, which is only present\nin some families of FRI signals, is shown to be related to a specific type of\nstructure, which can be characterized by viewing the signal model as a union of\nsubspaces. Finally, we develop a methodology for choosing the optimal sampling\nkernels based on a generalization of the Karhunen--Lo\\`eve transform.

Grassl and Roetteler devised an algorithm to encode a quantum\nconvolutional code with a \"pearl-necklace encoder.\" Despite their theoretical\nsignificance as a neat way of representing quantum convolutional codes, they\nare not well-suited to practical realization. In fact, there is no\nstraightforward way to implement any given pearl-necklace structure. This paper\ncloses the gap between theoretical representation and practical implementation.\nIn our previous work, we presented an efficient algorithm for finding a\nminimal-memory realization of a pearl-necklace encoder for\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) convolutional codes. This work extends our\nprevious work and presents an algorithm for turning a pearl-necklace encoder\nfor a general (non-CSS) quantum convolutional code into a realizable quantum\nconvolutional encoder. We show that a minimal-memory realization depends on the\ncommutativity relations between the gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.\nWe find a realization by means of a weighted graph which details the\nnon-commutative paths through the pearl-necklace. The weight of the longest\npath in this graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement\nthe encoder. The algorithm has a polynomial-time complexity in the number of\ngate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 15:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In\nparticular, astrocytes, the main type of glial cells in the cortex, have been\nshown to communicate with neurons and with each other. They are thought to form\na gap-junction-coupled syncytium supporting cell-cell communication via\npropagating Ca2+ waves. An identified mode of propagation is based on\ncytoplasm-to-cytoplasm transport of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) through gap\njunctions that locally trigger Ca2+ pulses via IP3-dependent Ca2+-induced Ca2+\nrelease. It is, however, currently unknown whether this intracellular route is\nable to support the propagation of long-distance regenerative Ca2+ waves or is\nrestricted to short-distance signaling. Furthermore, the influence of the\nintracellular signaling dynamics on intercellular propagation remains to be\nunderstood. In this work, we propose a model of the gap-junctional route for\nintercellular Ca2+ wave propagation in astrocytes showing that: (1)\nlong-distance regenerative signaling requires nonlinear coupling in the gap\njunctions, and (2) even with nonlinear gap junctions, long-distance\nregenerative signaling is favored when the internal Ca2+ dynamics implements\nfrequency modulation-encoding oscillations with pulsating dynamics, while\namplitude modulation-encoding dynamics tends to restrict the propagation range.\nAs a result, spatially heterogeneous molecular properties and/or weak couplings\nare shown to give rise to rich spatiotemporal dynamics that support complex\npropagation behaviors. These results shed new light on the mechanisms\nimplicated in the propagation of Ca2+ waves across astrocytes and precise the\nconditions under which glial cells may participate in information processing in\nthe brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 15:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}
