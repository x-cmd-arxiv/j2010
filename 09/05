In this article, a new\nmechanism of fast electron generation at the vacuum-solid boundary of intense\nlaser pulse interaction with overdense plasma is described. It is one that has\nno analogue in classical, non-relativistic laser-plasma interactions. Here,\nconclusive proof is provided that the key contribution to the fast electron\ngeneration is given by the zero points of the vector potential. We demonstrate\nthat the new mechanism leads to scalings for the fast electron energy, which\nexplicitly depend on the plasma density, thus providing a new insight into\nrelativistic laser-matter interaction. Furthermore, it is shown that this new\nmechanism provides the dominant contribution to the interaction by the\ninjection of energy into the overdense plasma delivered by attosecondduration\nelectron bunches. This new understanding will allow the future generation of a\nsingle ultra-bright attosecond X-ray pulse by suitable control of the laser\npulse polarization [1]-[7]. This process will also allow single pulse\nattosecond electron bunches to be generated that can be further accelerated in\nlaser wakefield accelerators [8]-[10]. Other applications that will benefit\nfrom this new insight include laser driven ion accelerators [11]-[15], fast\nignition inertial confinement fusion [16]-[18] as well as fundamental studies\nat the intensity frontier [19]-[20].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 16:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

Their\nproperties remain elusive despite more than 50 years of intense research\nactivity. In this review we remind the reader of the noticeable properties of\nthese particles and of the stakes of the solar neutrino puzzle. The Standard\nSolar Model triggered persistent efforts in fundamental Physics to predict the\nsolar neutrino fluxes, and its constantly evolving predictions have been\nregularly compared to the detected neutrino signals. Anticipating that this\nstandard model could not reproduce the internal solar dynamics, a SEismic Solar\nModel was developed which enriched theoretical neutrino flux predictions with\nin situ observation of acoustic waves propagating in the Sun. This review\nreminds the historical steps, from the pioneering Homestake detection, the\nGALLEX- SAGE captures of the first pp neutrinos and emphasizes the importance\nof the Superkamiokande and SNO detectors to demonstrate that the solar-emitted\nelectronic neutrinos are partially transformed into other neutrino flavors\nbefore reaching the Earth. The success of BOREXINO in detecting the 7 Be\nneutrino signal justifies the building of a new generation of detectors to\nmeasure the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A coherent picture emerged from\nneutrino physics and helioseismology. Today, new paradigms take shape:\ndetermining the masses of neutrinos and the research on the Sun is focusing on\nthe dynamical aspects and on signature of dark matter. The third part of the\nreview is dedicated to this prospect. The understanding of the crucial role of\nboth rotation and magnetism in solar physics benefit from SoHO, SDO, and PICARD\nspace observations. For now, the particle and stellar challenges seem\ndecoupled, but this is only a superficial appearance. The development of\nasteroseismology shows the far-reaching impact of Neutrino and Stellar\nAstronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 17:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 15:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

ACT measures fluctuations at scales 500<l<10000. We fit a model for the\nlensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz\nand 218 GHz power spectra, including thermal and kinetic SZ, Poisson power from\nradio and infrared point sources, and clustered power from infrared point\nsources. The power from thermal and kinetic SZ at 148 GHz is estimated to be\nB_3000 = 6.8+-2.9 uK^2, where B_l=l(l+1)C_l/2pi. We estimate primary\ncosmological parameters from the 148 GHz spectrum, marginalizing over SZ and\nsource power. The LCDM cosmological model is a good fit to the data, and LCDM\nparameters estimated from ACT+WMAP are consistent with the 7-year WMAP limits,\nwith scale invariant n_s = 1 excluded at 99.7% CL (3sigma). A model with no CMB\nlensing is disfavored at 2.8sigma. By measuring the third to seventh acoustic\npeaks, and probing the Silk damping regime, the ACT data improve limits on\ncosmological parameters that affect the small-scale CMB power. The ACT data\ncombined with WMAP give a 6sigma detection of primordial helium, with Y_P =\n0.313+-0.044, and a 4sigma detection of relativistic species, assumed to be\nneutrinos, with Neff = 5.3+-1.3 (4.6+-0.8 with BAO+H0 data). From the CMB alone\nthe running of the spectral index is constrained to be dn/dlnk = -0.034 +-\n0.018, the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r<0.25 (95% CL), and the\npossible contribution of Nambu cosmic strings to the power spectrum is\nconstrained to string tension Gmu<1.6 \\times 10^-7 (95% CL).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 20:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the long-term\naverage revenue for the service provider under each client's long-term average\nbudget constraint, and design an online algorithm which captures the stochastic\nproperties of users' queries and click-through behaviors. We solve the\noptimization problem by making connections to scheduling problems in wireless\nnetworks, queueing theory and stochastic networks. Unlike prior models, we do\nnot assume that the number of query arrivals is known. Due to the stochastic\nnature of the arrival process considered here, either temporary \"free\" service,\ni.e., service above the specified budget or under-utilization of the budget is\nunavoidable. We prove that our online algorithm can achieve a revenue that is\nwithin $O(\\epsilon)$ of the optimal revenue while ensuring that the overdraft\nor underdraft is $O(1/\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ can be arbitrarily small.\nWith a view towards practice, we can show that one can always operate strictly\nunder the budget.

It is as relevant for\nunmasking the dynamics of neurons in noisy environments as it is for designing\nreliable nanoscale logic circuit elements and sensors. Most studies of noise in\nnon-linear devices are limited to either time-correlated noise with a\nLorentzian spectrum (of which the white noise is a limiting case) or just white\nnoise. We use analytical theory and numerical simulations to study the impact\nof the more ubiquitous \"natural\" noise with a 1/f frequency spectrum.\nSpecifically, we study the impact of the 1/f noise on a leaky integrate and\nfire model of a neuron. The impact of noise is considered on two quantities of\ninterest to neuron function: The spike count Fano factor and the speed of\nneuron response to a small step-like stimulus. For the perfect (non-leaky)\nintegrate and fire model, we show that the Fano factor can be expressed as an\nintegral over noise spectrum weighted by a (low pass) filter function. This\nresult elucidates the connection between low frequency noise and disorder in\nneuron dynamics. We compare our results to experimental data of single neurons\nin vivo, and show how the 1/f noise model provides much better agreement than\nthe usual approximations based on Lorentzian noise. The low frequency noise,\nhowever, complicates the case for information coding scheme based on interspike\nintervals by introducing variability in the neuron response time. On a positive\nnote, the neuron response time to a step stimulus is, remarkably, nearly\noptimal in the presence of 1/f noise. An explanation of this effect elucidates\nhow the brain can take advantage of noise to prime a subset of the neurons to\nrespond almost instantly to sudden stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2010 22:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2011 03:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 04:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-16"}

Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense\nCS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with\nthe histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the\npyramid CS-LBP/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and\nthe start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection\nkernel SVMs. We also demonstrate that the combination of our pyramid CS-LBP\nfeature and the PHOG feature could significantly improve the detection\nperformance-producing state-of-the-art accuracy on the INRIA pedestrian\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2010 05:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 01:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-20"}

In clinical settings, multiple birth-death processes can describe\ndisease trajectories of individual patients, allowing for estimation of the\neffects of individual covariates on the birth and death rates of the process.\nSuch estimation is usually accomplished by analyzing patient data collected at\nunevenly spaced time points, referred to as panel data in the biostatistics\nliterature. Fitting linear BDI processes to panel data is a nontrivial\noptimization problem because birth and death rates can be functions of many\nparameters related to the covariates of interest. We propose a novel\nexpectation--maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting linear BDI models with\ncovariates to panel data.

No significant decrease in the\ncell viability of MNP-loaded DCs, compared to the control samples, was observed\nafter five days of culture. The amount of MNPs incorporated into the cytoplasm\nwas measured by magnetometry, which confirmed that 1 to 5 pg of the particles\nwere uploaded per cell. The intracellular distribution of these MNPs, assessed\nby transmission electron microscopy, was found to be primarily inside the\nendosomic structures. These cells were then subjected to an AMF for 30 min, and\nthe viability of the blank DCs (i.e., without MNPs), which were used as control\nsamples, remained essentially unaffected. However, a remarkable decrease of\nviability from approximately 90% to 2-5% of DCs previously loaded with MNPs was\nobserved after the same 30 min exposure to an AMF. The same results were\nobtained using MNPs having either positive (NH2+) or negative (COOH-) surface\nfunctional groups. In spite of the massive cell death induced by application of\nAMF to MNP-loaded DCs, the amount of incorporated magnetic particles did not\nraise the temperature of the cell culture. Clear morphological changes at the\ncell structure after magnetic field application were observed using scanning\nelectron microscopy. Therefore, local damage produced by the MNPs could be the\nmain mechanism for the selective cell death of MNP-loaded DCs under an AMF.\nBased on the ability of these cells to evade the reticuloendothelial system,\nthese complexes combined with an AMF should be considered as a potentially\npowerful tool for tumour therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2010 11:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2011 14:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-01"}

There is a great need to evaluate the quality of these methods by\ncomparing the estimated pedigree to the true pedigree.\n  In this paper, we consider two main pedigree comparison problems.

In existing\nprotocols where users have no interest in considering the encoded packets they\nhad in coding or decoding operations, this rule is expensive and inef-ficient.\nThis paper studies the impact of encoded packets in the reliable unicast\nnetwork coding via some theoretical analysis. Using our approach, receivers do\nnot only store the encoded packets they overheard, but also report these\ninformation to their neighbors, such that users enable to take account of\nencoded packets in their coding decisions as well as decoding operations.\nMoreover, we propose a redistribution algorithm to maximize the coding\nopportunities, which achieves better retransmission efficiency. Finally,\ntheoretical analysis and simulation results for a wheel network illustrate the\nimprove-ment in retransmissions efficiency due to the encoded packets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2010 14:19:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 06:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-16"}

The intrinsic brightness of M-giant stars means that this\ncatalog probes deep into the halo where substructures are expected to be\nabundant and easy to detect. Our analysis reveals 16 structures at high\nGalactic latitude (greater than 15 degree), of which 10 have been previously\nidentified. Among the six new structures two could plausibly be due to masks\napplied to the data, one is associated with a strong extinction region and one\nis probably a part of the Monoceros ring. Another one originates at low\nlatitudes, suggesting some contamination from disk stars, but also shows\nprotrusions extending to high latitudes, implying that it could be a real\nfeature in the stellar halo. The last remaining structure is free from the\ndefects discussed above and hence is very likely a satellite remnant. Although\nthe extinction in the direction of the structure is very low, the structure\ndoes match a low temperature feature in the dust maps. While this casts some\ndoubt on its origin, the low temperature feature could plausibly be due to real\ndust in the structure itself. The angular position and distance of this\nstructure encompass the Pisces overdensity traced by RR Lyraes in Stripe 82 of\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). However, the 2MASS M-giants indicate that\nthe structure is much more extended than what is visible with the SDSS, with\nthe point of peak density lying just outside Stripe 82. The morphology of the\nstructure is more like a cloud than a stream and reminiscent of that seen in\nsimulations of satellites disrupting along highly eccentric orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2010 15:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
