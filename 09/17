We study the dynamics of warped protoplanetary discs\nunder the combined effects of magnetic warping/precession torques and internal\nstresses in the disc, including viscous damping of warps and propagation of\nbending waves. We show that when the outer disc axis is misaligned with the\nstellar spin axis, the disc evolves towards a warped steady-state on a\ntimescale that depends on the disc viscosity or the bending wave propagation\nspeed, but in all cases is much shorter than the timescale for the spin\nevolution (of order of a million years). Moreover, for the most likely physical\nparameters characterizing magnetic protostars, circumstellar discs and their\ninteractions, the steady-state disc has a rather small warp, such that the\nwhole disc lies approximately in a single plane determined by the outer disc\nboundary conditions, although more extreme parameters may give rise to larger\ndisc warps. In agreement with our recent analysis (Lai et al. 2010) based on\nflat discs, we find that the back-reaction magnetic torques of the slightly\nwarped disc on the star can either align the stellar spin axis with the disc\naxis or push it towards misalignment, depending on the parameters of the\nstar-disc system. This implies that newly formed planetary systems may have a\nrange of inclination angles between the stellar spin axis and the symmetry axis\nof the planetary orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 18:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 16:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The first of these concerns\nthe fate of the destabilizing stationary DCM mode beyond the center manifold\nregime. Exploiting the natural singularly perturbed nature of the model, we\nderive an explicit reduced model of asymptotically high dimension which fully\ncaptures these dynamics. Our subsequent and fully detailed study of this model\n- which involves a subtle asymptotic analysis necessarily transgressing the\nboundaries of a local center manifold reduction - establishes that a stable DCM\npattern indeed appears from a transcritical bifurcation. However, we also\ndeduce that asymptotically close to the original destabilization, the DCM\nlooses its stability in a secondary bifurcation of Hopf type. This is in\nagreement with indications from numerical simulations available in the\nliterature. Employing the same methods, we also identify a much larger DCM\npattern.

In particular, the effective\ncapacity region of fading multiple access channels (MAC) in the presence of\nquality of service (QoS) constraints is studied. Perfect channel side\ninformation (CSI) is assumed to be available at both the transmitters and the\nreceiver. It is initially assumed the transmitters send the information at a\nfixed power level and hence do not employ power control policies. Under this\nassumption, the performance achieved by superposition coding with successive\ndecoding techniques is investigated. It is shown that varying the decoding\norder with respect to the channel states can significantly increase the\nachievable throughput region. In the two-user case, the optimal decoding\nstrategy is determined for the scenario in which the users have the same QoS\nconstraints. The performance of orthogonal transmission strategies is also\nanalyzed. It is shown that for certain QoS constraints, time-division\nmultiple-access (TDMA) can achieve better performance than superposition coding\nif fixed successive decoding order is used at the receiver side.\n  In the subsequent analysis, power control policies are incorporated into the\ntransmission strategies. The optimal power allocation policies for any fixed\ndecoding order over all channel states are identified. For a given variable\ndecoding order strategy, the conditions that the optimal power control policies\nmust satisfy are determined, and an algorithm that can be used to compute these\noptimal policies is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 19:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-17"}

Owing to the important\nastrophysical implications of this issue, we present here an independent\nassessment of the process. For this purpose, we compute free-free\nquasi-molecular absorption in Lyman-alpha due to collisions with H and H2\nwithin the one-perturber, quasi-static approximation. Line cross-sections are\nobtained using theoretical molecular potentials to describe the interaction\nbetween the radiating atom and the perturber. The variation of the\nelectric-dipole transition moment with the interparticle distance is also\nconsidered. Six and two allowed electric dipole transitions due to H-H and H-H2\ncollisions, respectively, are taken into account. The new theoretical\nLyman-alpha line profiles are then incorporated in our stellar atmosphere\nprogram for the computation of synthetic spectra and colours of DA-type white\ndwarfs. Illustrative model atmospheres and spectral energy distributions are\ncomputed, which show that Ly-alpha broadening by atoms and molecules has a\nsignificant effect on the white dwarf atmosphere models. The inclusion of this\ncollision-induced opacity significantly reddens spectral energy distributions\nand affects the broadband colour indices for model atmospheres with Teff<5000\nK. These results confirm those previously obtained by Kowalski & Saumon (2006).\nOur study points out the need for reliable evaluations of H3 potential energy\nsurfaces covering a large region of nuclear configurations, in order to obtain\na better description of H-H2 collisions and a more accurate evaluation of their\ninfluence on the spectrum of cool white dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 19:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this work we designate the object, KIC 10657664, simply as KHWD3. We\nuse the transit depth of ~0.66%, the eclipse depth of ~1.9%, and regular smooth\nperiodic variations at the orbital frequency and twice the orbital frequency to\nanalyze the system parameters. The smooth periodic variations are identified\nwith the classical ellipsoidal light variation and illumination effects, and\nthe newly utilized Doppler boosting effect.

When the low surface brightness regions are included, the\nslope of the star formation law depends primarily on the assumed fraction of\ndiffuse emission. In such case, results range from linear when the fraction of\ndiffuse emission in the SFR tracer is ~30% or less (or when diffuse emission is\nremoved in both the star formation and the molecular gas tracer), to\nsuper-linear when the diffuse fraction is ~50% and above.

Correcting for the average contribution due to the\ninternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, the\naverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-\n1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previous\nmeasurements for the Galaxy andM33. The cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derived\nfrom the CO data is on average two times smaller than the HI velocity\ndispersion measured in the same galaxies. The low cloud-cloudvelocity\ndispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determining\nthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especially\nin those regions of the disk which are H2 dominated. The cloud-cloud velocity\ndispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infrared\nluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the K-band absolute\nmagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. For three galaxies in the Virgo\ncluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typical\nresolution of high redshift CO observations) increases the measured velocity\ndispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measured\nrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1.

The images reveal narrow Faraday-rotation\nstructures on the visible disk of DeHt 5, as well as two wider, tail-like,\nstructures \"behind\" DeHt 5. Though DeHt 5 is an old PN known to be interacting\nwith the interstellar medium (ISM), a tail has not previously been identified\nfor this object. The innermost tail is approximately 3 pc long and runs away\nfrom the north-east edge of DeHt 5 in a direction roughly opposite that of the\nsky-projected space velocity of the white dwarf central star, WD 2218+706. We\nbelieve this tail to be the signature of ionized material ram-pressure stripped\nand deposited downstream during a >74,000 yr interaction between DeHt 5 and the\nISM. We estimate the rotation measure (RM) through the inner tail to be -15 +/-\n5 rad/m^2, and, using a realistic estimate for the line-of-sight component of\nthe ISM magnetic field around DeHt 5, derive an electron density in the inner\ntail of n_e = 3.6 +/- 1.8 cm^-3. Assuming the material is fully ionized, we\nestimate a total mass in the inner tail of 0.68 +/- 0.33 solar masses, and\npredict that 0.49 +/- 0.33 solar masses was added during the PN-ISM\ninteraction. The outermost tail consists of a series of three roughly circular\ncomponents, which have a collective length of approximately 11.0 pc. This tail\nis less conspicuous than the inner tail, and may be the signature of the\nearlier interaction between the WD 2218+706 asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nprogenitor and the ISM. The results for the inner and outer tails are\nconsistent with hydrodynamic simulations, and may have implications for the PN\nmissing-mass problem as well as for models which describe the impact of the\ndeaths of intermediate-mass stars on the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 20:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually\ninvoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are\ninitially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from\nthermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial\nacceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,\nusing two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We\nsystematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass\nratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due\nto the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with\nspectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated\nparticles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to\nthat of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA\nprocess. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have\nfairly low Alf\\'enic Mach numbers, M_A <~ 20, which is consistent with the\ntheoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (M_A\n<~ (m_i/m_e)^{1/2}). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust\nelectron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display\nnon-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic\nfields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic\nrays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be interconnected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 02:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 15:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We clarify which gradient\nis more responsible for the convection. Gravitational waves from the convection\nare also calculated.

We develop a method to quantify two important\naspects of the size of the word niche: the range of individuals using the word\nand the range of topics it is used to discuss. Controlling for word frequency,\nwe show that these aspects of the word niche are strong determinants of changes\nin word frequency.

Our analysis\nof changes in word frequencies over time reveals that the relative sizes of\nword niches are far more important than word frequencies in the dynamics of the\nentire vocabulary at shorter time scales, as the language adapts to new\nconcepts and social groupings. We also distinguish endogenous versus exogenous\nfactors as additional contributors to the fates of words, and demonstrate the\nforce of this distinction in the rise of novel words.

We found that the time-resolved spectra of 14\nout of 17 GRBs are best modeled with the Band function over the entire Fermi\nspectral range, which may suggest a common origin for emissions detected by LAT\nand GBM.

We use\nRXTE archival data of the recent GX 339-4 outburst and analyze them with the\nNASA HEAsoft package, version 6.8. We then compare the observed quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) frequencies with those from existing shock oscillation model\nand obtain the nature of evolution of the shock locations during the outburst.\nResults. We found that the QPO frequencies are monotonically increasing from\n0.102 Hz to 5.69 Hz within a period of ~ 26 days. We explain this evolution\nwith the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution and find the variation of\nthe initial and final shock locations and strengths. The model fits also give\nthe velocity of the propagating shock wave, which is responsible for the\ngeneration of QPOs and their evolutions, at ~ 10 m/s.

A class of\nasymptotic preserving schemes was introduced in [6] to handle this kind of\nproblems. The idea is to penalize the stiff collision term by a BGK type\noperator. This method, however, encounters its own difficulty when applied to\nthe quantum Boltzmann equation. To define the quantum Maxwellian (Bose-Einstein\nor Fermi- Dirac distribution) at each time step and every mesh point, one has\nto invert a nonlinear equation that connects the macroscopic quantity fugacity\nwith density and internal energy. Setting a good initial guess for the\niterative method is troublesome in most cases because of the complexity of the\nquantum functions (Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac function). In this paper, we\npropose to penalize the quantum collision term by a 'classical' BGK operator\ninstead of the quantum one. This is based on the observation that the classical\nMaxwellian, with the temperature replaced by the internal energy, has the same\nfirst five moments as the quantum Maxwellian. The scheme so designed avoids the\naforementioned difficulty, and one can show that the density distribution is\nstill driven toward the quantum equilibrium.

These three\ndimensional perturbations are governed by a system of linearized boundary layer\nequations around the Falkner-Skan base flow. Based on an asymptotic analysis of\nthis system near the free stream and the leading edge singularity, we show that\nfor acute wedge semi-angle, all solutions converge after a streamwise transient\nto a single streamwise-growing solution of the linearized equations, whose\ninitial condition near the leading edge is given by an eigenvalue problem first\nformulated in this context by Tumin (2001). Such a solution may be regarded as\na streamwise evolving most unstable streaky mode, in analogy with the usual\neigenmodes in strictly parallel flows, and shows an approximate\nself-similarity, which was partially known and is completed in this paper. An\nimportant consequence of this result is that the optimization procedure based\non the adjoint equations heretofore used to define optimal streaks is not\nnecessary. Instead, a simple low-dimensional optimization process is proposed\nand used to obtain optimal streaks. Comparison with previous results by Tumin\nand Ashpis (2003) shows an excellent agreement.

One of main difficulties in implementation of weak interactions in\nthe general relativistic framework lies on the fact that the characteristic\ntimescale of weak interaction processes (the WP timescale) in hot dense matters\nis much shorter than the dynamical timescale. Numerically this means that stiff\nsource terms appears in the equations so that an implicit scheme is in general\nnecessary to stably solve the relevant equations. Otherwise a very short\ntimestep will be required to solve them explicitly. Furthermore, in the\nrelativistic framework, the Lorentz factor is coupled with the rest mass\ndensity and the energy density. The specific enthalpy is also coupled with the\nmomentum. Due to these couplings, it is very complicated to recover the\nprimitive variables and the Lorentz factor from conserved quantities. At the\ncurrent status, no implicit procedure have been proposed except for the case of\nthe spherical symmetry. Therefore, an approximate, explicit procedure is\ndeveloped in the fully general relativistic framework in this paper as an first\nimplementation of the microphysics toward a more realistic sophisticated model.\nThe procedure is based on the so-called neutrino leakage schemes which is based\non the property that the characteristic timescale in which neutrinos leak out\nof the system (the leakage timescale) is much longer than the WP timescale. In\nthis paper, I present a detailed neutrino leakage scheme and a simple and\nstable method for solving the equations explicitly in the fully general\nrelativistic framework. I also perform a test simulation to check the validity\nof the present method, showing that it works fairly well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 08:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The unified picture of CVA and liquidity introduced by Morini &\nPrampolini 2010 has contributed to understanding this. However, there are two\nsignificant omissions for practical implementation that come from the same\nsource, i.e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first\nomission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An\nexample is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically\nwritten down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The\nsecond omission relates to collateralized positions. When these positions are\nout of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require\nfunding that cannot be secured using the position itself. These contingent\nfuture funding positions are usually not booked in any position-keeping system.\nWe show here how to include these two types of positions and thus help to\ncomplete the unified picture of CVA and liquidity.\n  For a particular large complex financial institution that profited $2.5B from\nspread widening we show that including Goodwill would have resulted in a $4B\nloss under conservative assumptions. Whilst we cannot make a similar assessment\nfor its collateralized derivative portfolio we calculate both the funding costs\nand the CVA from own default for a range of swaps and find that CVA was a\npositive contribution in the examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 08:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-20"}

We find that the\ncolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment for\nall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies in\nunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\\pm0.008 mag. The dependence on\nmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by\n0.093\\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.\nWe study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\\pm0.005, while the\ncolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.\nThe spectral analysis that we perform on our ETGs sample is in good agreement\nwith our photometric results: we find for D4000 a dependence on mass between\nhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment\n(respectively a difference of of 0.11\\pm0.02 and of 0.05\\pm0.02); for the\nequivalent width of H{\\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\\pm0.08 {\\AA}across\nthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.By analyzing\nthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of a\ndownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger D4000 and an\nalmost constant equivalent width of $H\\delta$ formed their mass at higher\nredshift than lower mass ones. We also conclude that the main driver of galaxy\nevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 09:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

With integral field absorption spectroscopy and with\nplanetary nebulae as tracers, velocity dispersion and rotation profiles have\nbeen followed to ~4 and ~5-8 effective radii, respectively, and in M87 to the\nouter edge at ~150 kpc. The results are generally consistent with the known\ndichotomy of elliptical galaxy types, but some galaxies show more complex\nrotation profiles in their halos and there is a higher incidence of\nmisalignments, indicating triaxiality. Dynamical models have shown a range of\nslopes for the total mass profiles, and that the inner dark matter densities in\nellipticals are higher than in spiral galaxies, indicating earlier assembly\nredshifts. Analysis of the hot X-ray emitting gas in X-ray bright ellipticals\nand comparison with dynamical mass determinations indicates that non-thermal\ncomponents to the pressure may be important in the inner ~10 kpc, and that the\nproperties of these systems are closely related to their group environments.\nFirst results on the outer halo stellar population properties do not yet give a\nclear picture. In the halo of one bright galaxy, lower [alpha/Fe] abundances\nindicate longer star formation histories pointing towards late accretion of the\nhalo. This is consistent with independent evidence for on-going accretion, and\nsuggests a connection to the observed size evolution of elliptical galaxies\nwith redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 09:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Specific\nsoftware for the reduction of XMM-Newton data was used for the analysis of our\nobservation. For the detection of sources, we used the wavelet-based code\nPWDetect. General coronal properties were derived from plasma model fitting. We\nalso determined variability of the Eta Chamaleontis members in the EPIC\nfield-of-view. A total of six flare-like events were clearly detected in five\ndifferent stars. For them, we derived coronal properties during the flare\nevents and pseudo-quiescent state separately. In our observations, stars that\nunderwent a flare event have higher X-ray luminosities in the pseudo-quiescent\nstate than cluster members with similar spectral type with no indications of\nflaring, independently whether they have an accretion disk or not. Observed\nflare energies are typical of both pre-main and main-sequence M stars. We\ndetected no difference between flare energies of stars with and without an\naccretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 10:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

These problems combine to make\nhigh-speed spectroscopy of faint targets the most demanding of astronomical\nobservations. It is possible to overcome these weaknesses by using\nelectron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs). EMCCDs are conventional frame-transfer\nCCDs, but with an extended serial register containing high-voltage electrodes.\nAn avalanche of secondary electrons is produced as the photon-generated\nelectrons are clocked through this register, resulting in signal amplification\nthat renders the read noise negligible. Using a combination of laboratory\nmeasurements with the QUCAM2 EMCCD camera and Monte Carlo modelling, we show\nthat it is possible to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of an\nobservation by using an EMCCD, but only if it is optimised and utilised\ncorrectly. We also show that even greater gains are possible through the use of\nphoton counting. We present a recipe for astronomers to follow when setting up\na typical EMCCD observation which ensures that maximum signal-to-noise ratio is\nobtained.

Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES), that there is a highly metallic universal 2DEG at the\nvacuum-cleaved surface of SrTiO3, independent of bulk carrier densities over\nmore than seven decades, including the undoped insulating material. This 2DEG\nis confined within a region of ~5 unit cells with a sheet carrier density of\n~0.35 electrons per a^2 (a is the cubic lattice parameter). We unveil a\nremarkable electronic structure consisting on multiple subbands of heavy and\nlight electrons. The similarity of this 2DEG with those reported in\nSrTiO3-based heterostructures and field-effect transistors suggests that\ndifferent forms of electron confinement at the surface of SrTiO3 lead to\nessentially the same 2DEG. Our discovery provides a model system for the study\nof the electronic structure of 2DEGs in SrTiO3-based devices, and a novel route\nto generate 2DEGs at surfaces of transition-metal oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 13:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Prior works focused almost exclusively on equilibrium starvation.\nIn this paper, we show that links in CSMA wireless networks are also\nsusceptible to temporal starvation. Specifically, although some links have good\nequilibrium throughputs and do not suffer from equilibrium starvation, they can\nstill have no throughput for extended periods from time to time. Given its\nimpact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize\ntemporal starvation. To this end, we develop a \"trap theory\" to analyze\ntemporal throughput fluctuation. The trap theory serves two functions. First,\nit allows us to derive new mathematical results that shed light on the\ntransient behavior of CSMA networks. For example, we show that the duration of\na trap, during which some links receive no throughput, is insensitive to the\ndistributions of the backoff countdown and transmission time (packet duration)\nin the CSMA protocol. Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the\n\"degrees of starvation\" for CSMA networks to aid network design. For example,\ngiven a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and\nif so, which links will starve. Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of\ntemporal starvation can also be computed. We believe that the ability to\nidentify and characterize temporal starvation as established in this paper will\nserve as an important first step toward the design of effective remedies for\nit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 13:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-20"}

Unlike to usual experiments in particle\nphysics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principle\ndecrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively or\nconstructively. Consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from the\nsignal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulses\nmust be studied with care. First, noise has to be determined consistently with\nthe definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum field\nstrength of the radio pulse. Second, the average impact of noise on radio pulse\nmeasurements at individual antennas is studied for LOPES. It is shown that a\ncorrect treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noise\nratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height and\ntime measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateral\ndistributions.

In the peak model pioneered by BBKS, one considers instead\ndensity maxima of the initial, Gaussian mass density field as an approximation\nto the formation site of virialized objects. In this paper, the peak model is\nextended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy. Firstly, we derive the\ntwo-point correlation function of initial density peaks up to second order and\ndemonstrate that a peak-background split approach can be applied to obtain the\nk-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors at all orders. Secondly, we\nexplore the gravitational evolution of the peak correlation function within the\nZel'dovich approximation. We show that the local (Lagrangian) bias approach\nemerges as a special case of the peak model, in which all bias parameters are\nscale-independent and there is no statistical velocity bias. We apply our\nformulae to study how the Lagrangian peak biasing, the diffusion due to large\nscale flows and the mode-coupling due to nonlocal interactions affect the scale\ndependence of bias from small separations up to the baryon acoustic oscillation\n(BAO) scale. For 2-sigma density peaks collapsing at z=0.3, our model predicts\na ~ 5% residual scale-dependent bias around the acoustic scale that arises\nmostly from first-order Lagrangian peak biasing (as opposed to second-order\ngravity mode-coupling). We also search for a scale dependence of bias in the\nlarge scale auto-correlation of massive halos extracted from a very large\nN-body simulation provided by the MICE collaboration. For halos with mass\nM>10^{14}Msun/h, our measurements demonstrate a scale-dependent bias across the\nBAO feature which is very well reproduced by a prediction based on the peak\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 15:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 09:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

Due to the\nstructure of the chiral interactions, each coupling in the DME functional is\ngiven as the sum of a coupling constant arising from zero-range contact\ninteractions and a coupling function of the density arising from the\nfinite-range pion exchanges. Since the contact contributions have essentially\nthe same structure as those entering empirical Skyrme functionals, a\nmicroscopically guided Skyrme phenomenology has been suggested in which the\ncontact terms in the DME functional are released for optimization to\nfinite-density observables to capture short-range correlation energy\ncontributions from beyond Hartree-Fock. The present paper is the first attempt\nto assess the ability of the newly suggested DME functional, which has a much\nricher set of density dependencies than traditional Skyrme functionals, to\ngenerate sensible and stable results for nuclear applications. The results of\nthe first proof-of-principle calculations are given, and numerous practical\nissues related to the implementation of the new functional in existing Skyrme\ncodes are discussed. Using a restricted singular value decomposition (SVD)\noptimization procedure, it is found that the new DME functional gives\nnumerically stable results and exhibits a small but systematic reduction of our\ntest $\\chi^2$ function compared to standard Skyrme functionals, thus justifying\nits suitability for future global optimizations and large-scale calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 15:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-02"}

Rest of the\nuniverse is made up of 70% of dark-energy and 25% of dark-matter. Dark-energy\nis responsible for acceleration of the expanding universe; whereas dark-matter\nis said to be necessary as extra-mass of bizarre-properties to explain the\nanomalous rotational-velocity of galaxy. Though the existence of dark-energy\nhas gradually been accepted in scientific community, but the candidates for\ndark-matter have not been found as yet and are too crazy to be accepted. Thus,\nit is obvious to look for an alternative theory in place of dark-matter.\nIsrael-scientist M. Milgrom has suggested a 'Modified Newtonian Dynamics\n(MOND)' which appears to be highly successful for explaining the anomalous\nrotational-velocity. But unfortunately MOND lacks theoretical support. The\nMOND, in-fact, is (empirical) modification of Newtonian-Dynamics through\nmodification in the kinematical acceleration term 'a' (which is normally taken\nas $a=\\frac{v^{2}}{r}$) as effective kinematic acceleration $a_{effective} = a\n\\mu (\\frac{a}{a_{0}})$, wherein the $\\mu$-function is 1 for usual-values of\naccelerations but equals to $\\frac{a}{a_{0}} (\\ll 1)$ if the acceleration 'a'\nis extremely-low lower than a critical value $a_0 (10^{-10} m/s^{2})$. In the\npresent paper, a novel variant of MOND is proposed with theoretical backing;\nwherein with the consideration of universe's acceleration $a_{d}$ due to\ndark-energy, a new type of $\\mu$-function on theoretical-basis emerges out\nleading to $a_{effective} = a(1 - K \\frac{a_{0}}{a})$. The proposed\ntheoretical-MOND model too is able to fairly explain qualitatively the\nmore-or-less 'flat' velocity-curve of galaxy-rotation, and is also able to\npredict a dip (minimum) on the curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 11:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}

Along this oval, between 170 and 280 pc from the\nnucleus we find a partial ring of low sigma (~50 km/s) attributed to an\nintermediate age stellar population. Fro measurements of the emission-line\nfluxes and profiles ([PII]1.19um, [FeII]1.26um, Pa-beta and H2 2.12um), we have\nconstructed maps for the gas centroid velocity, velocity dispersion, as well as\nchannel maps.

The compact rotating disc is more conspicuous in the H2\nemitting gas, which presents the smallest sigma values and most clear rotation\npattern, supporting a location in the galaxy plane.
