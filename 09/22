Every insurance\ncompany should be capable of running a holistic risk management process to meet\nthis challenge. For property and casualty (P&C) insurance companies the risk\nadequate modelling of the claim reserves is a very important topic as this\nliabilities determine up to 70% percent of the balance sum. We propose a three\ndimensional (3D) stochastic model for claim reserving. It delivers consistently\nthe reserve's distribution function as well as the distributions of all parts\nof it that are needed for accounting and controlling. The calibration methods\nfor the model are well known from data analysis and they are applicable in an\npractitioner environment. We evaluate the model numerically by the help of\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation. Classical actuarial reserve models are two\ndimensional (2D). They lead to an estimation algorithm that is applied on a 2D\nmatrix, the run off triangle. Those methods (for instance the Chain - Ladder or\nthe Bornhuetter - Ferguson method) are widely used in practice nowadays and\ngive rise to several problems: They estimate the reserves' expectation and some\nof them - under very restriction assumptions - the variance. They provide no\ninformation about the tail of the reserve's distribution, what would be most\nimportant for risk calculation, for assessing the insurance company's financial\nstability and economic situation. Additionally, due to the projection of the\nclaim process into a two dimensional space the results are very often distorted\nand dependent on the kind of projection.

The\nradial gradients (in a dimensionless logarithmic form) of density and\ntemperature are assumed to be constant near the planet. We find that the torque\nis roughly equally sensitive to the surface density and temperature radial\ngradients. Both gradients contribute to inward migration when they are\nnegative. Our results indicate that two-dimensional calculations with a\nsmoothed planet potential, used to account for the effects of the third\ndimension, do not accurately determine the effects of density and temperature\ngradients on the three-dimensional torque. The results suggest that\nsubstantially slowing or stopping planet migration by means of changes in disk\nopacity or shadowing is difficult and appears unlikely for a disk that is\nlocally isothermal. The scalings of the torque and torque density with planet\nmass and gas sound speed follow the expectations of linear theory. We also\ndetermine an improved formula for the torque density distribution that can be\nused in one-dimensional long-term evolution studies of planets embedded in\nlocally isothermal disks. This formula can be also applied in the presence of\nmildly varying radial gradients and of planets that open gaps. We illustrate\nits use in the case of migrating super-Earths and determine some conditions\nsufficient for survival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 17:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 04:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion\nchannels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a\ndifferential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there\nhave been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential\nequation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by\nMarkov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised\ndoubts that SDE models can preserve the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain\nmodels.\n  We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the\nMarkov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two\nthat describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former\nchannel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its\neffect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously\ndemonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis\nprovides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the\ntemporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of\nbundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not\ncorrectly account for this structure. Our study therefore confirms and\nelucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based\nSDE models. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that Markov chain models\nof the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately\napproximated by SDEs. This finding opens a door to future modeling work using\nSDE techniques to further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on\nelectrically active cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 18:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-27"}

Indeed, the fundamental group of a 3-manifold is\nleft-orderable whenever the first Betti number is positive; in the case that\nthe first Betti number is zero this property is closely tied to the existence\nof certain nice foliations. As a result, many large classes of 3-manifolds,\nincluding knot complements, are known to have left-orderable fundamental group.\nHowever, though the complement of a knot has left-orderable fundamental group,\nthe result of Dehn surgery is a closed 3-manifold that need not have this\nproperty. We take this as motivation for the study of left-orderability in the\ncontext of Dehn surgery, and establish a condition on peripheral elements that\nmust hold whenever a given Dehn surgery yields a manifold with left-orderable\nfundamental group. This leads to a workable criterion used to determine when\nsufficiently positive Dehn surgery produces manifolds with non-left-orderable\nfundamental group. As examples we produce infinite families of hyperbolic knots\n-- subsuming the (-2,3,q)-pretzel knots -- for which sufficiently positive\nsurgery always produces a manifold with non-left-orderable fundamental group.\nOur examples are consistent with the observation that many (indeed, all known)\nexamples of L-spaces have non-left-orderable fundamental group, as the given\nfamilies of knots are hyperbolic L-space knots. Moreover, the behaviour of the\nexamples studied here is consistent with the property that sufficiently\npositive surgery on an L-space knot always yields an L-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 19:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 16:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

The high eccentricities are not easily explained by\nplanet-formation models, which predict that planets should be on rather\ncircular orbits. Here we explore whether fly-bys involving planetary systems\nwith properties similar to those of the gas giants in the solar system, can\nproduce planets with properties similar to the observed planets. Using\nnumerical simulations, we show that fly-bys can cause the immediate ejection of\nplanets, and sometimes also lead to the capture of one or more planets by the\nintruder. More common, however, is that fly-bys only perturb the orbits of\nplanets, sometimes leaving the system in an unstable state. Over time-scales of\na few million to several hundred million years after the fly-by, this\nperturbation can trigger planet-planet scatterings, leading to the ejection of\none or more planets. For example, in the case of the four gas giants of the\nsolar system, the fraction of systems from which at least one planet is ejected\nmore than doubles in 10^8 years after the fly-by. The remaining planets are\noften left on more eccentric orbits, similar to the eccentricities of the\nobserved extrasolar planets. We combine our results of how fly-bys effect\nsolar-system-like planetary systems, with the rate at which encounters in young\nstellar clusters occur. For example, we measure the effects of fly-bys on the\nfour gas giants in the solar system. We find, that for such systems, between 5\nand 15 per cent suffer ejections of planets in 10^8 years after fly-bys in\ntypical open clusters. Thus, encounters in young stellar clusters can\nsignificantly alter the properties of any planets orbiting stars in clusters.\nAs a large fraction of stars which populate the solar neighbourhood form in\nstellar clusters, encounters can significantly affect the properties of the\nobserved extrasolar planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The procedure adopted to detect the variable stars was the\noptimal image subtraction method (ISIS v2.2), as implemented by Alard. The\nphotometry was performed using both ISIS and DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME. We have\nidentified 245 variable stars in the cluster fields that have been analyzed so\nfar, of which 179 are new discoveries. Of these variables, 133 are fundamental\nmode RR Lyrae stars (RRab), 76 are first overtone (RRc) pulsators, 4 are type\nII Cepheids, 25 are long-period variables (LPV), 1 is an eclipsing binary, and\n6 are not yet well classified. Such a large number of RR Lyrae stars places M62\namong the top two most RR Lyrae-rich (in the sense of total number of RR Lyrae\nstars present) GCs known in the Galaxy, second only to M3 (NGC 5272) with a\ntotal of 230 known RR Lyrae stars. Since this study covers most but not all of\nthe cluster area, it is not unlikely that M62 is in fact the most RR Lyrae-rich\nGC in the Galaxy. In like vein, we were also able to detect the largest sample\nof LPV's known in a Galactic GC. We analyze a variety of Oosterhoff type\nindicators for the cluster, and conclude that M62 is an Oosterhoff type I\nsystem. This is in good agreement with the moderately high metallicity of the\ncluster, in spite of its predominantly blue horizontal branch morphology --\nwhich is more typical of Oosterhoff type II systems. We thus conclude that\nmetallicity plays a key role in defining Oosterhoff type. [abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 20:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The model predicts a zero-mass pion for zero-mass quarks and a Regge\nspectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the leading orbital\nangular momentum $L$ of hadrons and the radial quantum number $N$. Light-Front\nHolography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension\nvariable $z$ of anti-de Sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized\non the light front. The resulting Lorentz-invariant relativistic light-front\nwave equations are functions of an invariant impact variable $\\zeta$ which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. The result is a semi-classical frame-independent\nfirst approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and\nbaryon light-quark bound states, which in turn predict the behavior of the pion\nand nucleon form factors. The effects of chiral symmetry breaking increase as\none goes toward large interquark separation, consistent with spectroscopic\ndata, and the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different\norbital angular momentum; e.g., the proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless\nquarks has L=0 and L=1 light-front Fock components with equal probability.

This extended relic is\nlinearly polarized as seen in our GBT data, the NVSS, and archival images,\nstrengthening a shock interpretation. The extended relic borders a previously\nundetected \"wall\" of galaxies in the infall region of the Coma cluster.

This front is\ncoincident with a similar discontinuity in the X-ray surface brightness and\ntemperature in its southern half, suggesting a primary shock-acceleration\norigin for the local synchrotron emitting electrons. The northern half of the\nsynchrotron front is less well correlated with the X-ray properties, perhaps\ndue to projection effects. We confirm the global pixel-to-pixel power-law\ncorrelation between the 352 MHz radio brightness and X-ray brightness with a\nslope that is inconsistent with predictions of either primary shock\nacceleration or secondary production of relativistic electrons in Giant Radio\nHalos, but is allowable in the framework of the turbulent re-acceleration of\nrelic plasma.

Measurements by EIS indicate that the outflows reach velocities\nof 50 km/s with spectral line asymmetries approaching 200 km/s. It has been\nsuggested that these outflows may lie on open field lines that connect to the\nheliosphere, and that they could potentially be a significant source of the\nslow speed solar wind. A direct link has been difficult to establish, however.\nIn this letter, we use EIS measurements of spectral line intensities that are\nsensitive to changes in the relative abundance of Si and S as a result of the\nfirst ionization potential (FIP) effect, to measure the chemical composition in\nthe outflow regions of AR 10978 over a period of 5 days in December 2007. We\nfind that Si is always enhanced over S by a factor of 3--4. This is generally\nconsistent with the enhancement factor of low FIP elements measured in-situ in\nthe slow solar wind by non-spectroscopic methods. Plasma with a slow wind-like\ncomposition was therefore flowing from the edge of the active region for at\nleast 5 days. Furthermore, on December 10--11, when the outflow from the\nwestern side was favorably oriented in the Earth direction, the Si/S ratio was\nfound to match the value measured a few days later by ACE/SWICS. These results\nprovide strong observational evidence for a direct connection between the solar\nwind, and the coronal plasma in the outflow regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 08:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 03:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 04:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Our galaxies are selected to have stellar\nmasses greater than 10^10 Msun and redshifts in the range 0.025<z<0.05. We\nextract a sub-sample of 1833 \"early-type\" galaxies with inclinations less than\n70deg, with concentration indices C>2.6 and with light profiles that are well\nfit by a De Vaucouleurs model. We then stack HI line spectra extracted from the\nALFALFA data cubes at the 3-D positions of the galaxies from these two samples\nin bins of stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, central velocity\ndispersion, and NUV-r colour. We use the stacked spectra to estimate the\naverage HI gas fractions M_HI/M_* of the galaxies in each bin.\n  Our main result is that the HI content of a galaxy is not influenced by its\nbulge. The average HI gas fractions of galaxies in both our samples correlate\nmost strongly with NUV-r colour and with stellar surface density. The relation\nbetween average HI fraction and these two parameters is independent of\nconcentration index C. We have tested whether the average HI gas content of\nbulge-dominated galaxies on the red sequence, differs from that of late-type\ngalaxies on the red sequence. We find no evidence that galaxies with a\nsignificant bulge component are less efficient at turning their available gas\nreservoirs into stars. This result is in contradiction with the \"morphological\nquenching\" scenario proposed by Martig et al. (2009).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 09:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The interaction\npotential was obtained using a combination of the explicitly correlated\nunrestricted coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative\ntriple excitations [UCCSD(T)-F12] for the core-core and core-valence\ncorrelation and full configuration interaction for the valence-valence\ncorrelation. The potential energy surface has a global minimum 8743 cm^{-1}\ndeep if the Li-H bond length is held fixed at the monomer equilibrium distance\nor 8825 cm^{-1} deep if it is allowed to vary. In order to evaluate the\nperformance of the conventional CCSD(T) approach, calculations were carried out\nusing correlation-consistent polarized valence X-tuple-zeta bases, with X\nranging from 2 to 5. The contribution beyond the CCSD(T)-F12 model, obtained\nfrom full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations for the valence-valence\ncorrelation, was shown to be very small. At linear LiH-Li geometries the\nground-state potential shows an avoided crossing with an ion-pair\npotential.Using both adiabatic and diabatic pictures we analyse the interaction\nbetween the two potential energy surfaces and its possible impact on the\ncollisional dynamics. When the LiH bond is allowed to vary, a seam of conical\nintersections appears at C_{2v} geometries. At the linear LiH-Li geometry, the\nconical intersection is at a Li-H distance which is only slightly larger than\nthe monomer equilibrium distance, but for nonlinear geometries it quickly\nshifts to Li-H distances that are well outside the classical turning points of\nthe ground-state potential of LiH. Finally, the reaction channels for the\nexchange and insertion reactions are also analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 09:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 11:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2011 19:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This can be viewed as a regression problem where the function to be\nestimated takes as its values algebraic curves (for instance, ellipses) rather\nthan scalars, as usual. The problem is motivated by many important\nastrophysical applications, concerning for instance the analysis of the weak\ngravitational lensing effect, i.e. the distortion effect of gravity on the\nimages of distant galaxies. We propose a thresholding procedure based upon the\n(mixed) spin needlets construction recently advocated by Geller and Marinucci\n(2008,2010) and Geller et al. (2008,2009), and we investigate their rates of\nconvergence and their adaptive properties over spin Besov balls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 12:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

For the weak-coupling case,\nthe spontaneous emission spectrum of the qubit is a single peak, with its\nlocation depending on the spectral density of the qubit environment. Increasing\nthe qubit-cavity coupling increases the asymmetry (the positions about the\nqubit energy spacing and heights of the two peaks) of the two spontaneous\nemission peaks (which are related to the vacuum Rabi splitting) more.\nExplicitly, for a qubit in a low-frequency intrinsic bath, the height asymmetry\nof the splitting peaks becomes larger, when the qubit-cavity coupling strength\nis increased. However, for a qubit in an Ohmic bath, the height asymmetry of\nthe spectral peaks is inverted from the same case of the low-frequency bath,\nwhen the qubit is strongly coupled to the cavity. Increasing the qubit-cavity\ncoupling to the lower bound of the ultra-strong regime, the height asymmetry of\nthe left and right peak heights are inverted, which is consistent with the same\ncase of low-frequency bath, only relatively weak.

The 2D continuum\nradiative transfer in ProDiMo includes isotropic scattering. The dust\ntemperature is set by the condition of radiative equilibrium. In the\nthermal-decoupled case the gas temperature is governed by the balance between\nvarious heating and cooling processes. The gas and dust interact thermally via\nphotoelectrons, radiatively, and via gas accommodation on grain surfaces. As a\nresult, the gas is much hotter than in the thermo-coupled case, where the gas\nand dust temperatures are equal, reaching a few thousands K in the upper disc\nlayers and making the inner rim higher. A physically motivated density drop at\nthe inner radius (\"soft-edge\") results in rounded inner rims, which appear\nring-like in near-infrared images.

New CCDs also offer resolutions of 30-50 (E/dE), which is\nsufficient to detect lines in hot plasmas and to resolve many lines shaped by\ndynamical processes in accretion flows. The spectral capabilities of X-ray CCDs\nhave been particularly important in detecting relativistic emission lines from\nthe inner disks around accreting neutron stars and black holes. One drawback of\nX-ray CCDs is that spectra can be distorted by photon \"pile-up\", wherein two or\nmore photons may be registered as a single event during one frame time. We have\nconducted a large number of simulations using a statistical model of photon\npile-up to assess its impacts on relativistic disk line and continuum spectra\nfrom stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars.

In contrast, our\nsimulations suggest that disk continua affected by severe pile-up are measured\nto have falsely low flux values, leading to falsely small radii and falsely\nhigh spin values.

One of the current\nlimitations of the framework is that from a set of independent \"synchronous\nmachines\", one must compose the entire synchronous system by hand, which is\ntedious and error-prone. We use Maude's meta-level to automatically generate a\nsynchronous composition from user-provided component machines and a description\nof how the machines communicate with each other. We then use the new\ncapabilities to verify the correctness of a distributed topology control\nprotocol for wireless networks in the presence of nodes that may fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 04:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}
