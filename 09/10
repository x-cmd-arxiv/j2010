Finally, the galaxy with the most evolved starburst, M82, has clouds\nwith a rather uniform density structure, large envelopes of atomic/molecular\ngas subjected to UV photodissociating radiation from young star clusters, and\nvery different chemical abundances of HC3N and CH3CCH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 17:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Results.\nThe abundances derived from the lines of Mult. 1 in TO stars differ from the\nabundances of giants of the same clusters. This is true both using CO5BOLD\nmodels and using traditional 1D model atmospheres. The LTE 3D corrections for\nTO stars are large, while they are small for giant stars. Conclusions. The Cu I\nresonance lines of Mult. 1 are not reliable abundance indicators. It is likely\nthat departures from LTE should be taken into account to properly describe\nthese lines, although it is not clear if these alone can account for the\nobservations. An investigation of these departures is indeed encouraged for\nboth dwarfs and giants. Our recommendation to those interested in the study of\nthe evolution of copper abundances is to rely on the measurements in giants,\nbased on the lines of Mult. 2. We caution, however, that NLTE studies may imply\na revision in all the Cu abundances, both in dwarfs and giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 18:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2010 15:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Spitzer images in the IR at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,\n8.0um, and 24um and GALEX images at 1500\\AA{} and 2300\\AA{} allow us to resolve\nthe galaxy on scales between 240-600pc. We supplement these with archival data\nin the B, J, H, and K bands. We use the 8um, 24um and FUV (1500\\AA) emission to\nstudy the star formation rate (SFR). We find that globally, these tracers of\nstar formation give a range of results of ~6-11\\msun/yr, with the\ndust-corrected FUV giving the highest value of SFR. We can reconcile the UV and\nIR-based estimates by adopting a steeper UV extinction curve that lies in\nbetween the starburst (Calzetti) and SMC extinction curves. However, the\nregions of highest SFR intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a\nstarburst-like extinction. Overall, the level of star-formation we find is\nhigher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,\nwhich, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction that\ncaused the distorted morphology of NGC2442 likely also triggered increased\nlevels of star-formation activity. Outside of the spiral arms, we discover what\nappears to be a superbubble, ~1.7kpc across in the IRAC images. Significant\nH{\\alpha}, UV and IR emission in the area also suggest vigorous ongoing\nstar-formation. A known, recent supernova (SN1999ga) is located at the edge of\nthis superbubble. Although speculative at this stage, this area suggests a\nlarge star-forming region with a morphology shaped by generations of\nsupernovae. Lastly, we discover an 8um (PAH) circumnuclear ring with an ~0.8kpc\nradius. The H{\\alpha} emission is largely concentrated inside that ring and\nshows a vague spiral structure in the rest of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 18:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The aspect ratio of the\nrectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights\nand can become arbitrarily high.\n  We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal\npartition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles.

This simulation develops less quickly than an otherwise\nequivalent single perturbation simulation but eventually exhibits a higher\nreconnection rate. The unobstructed outflow jets are faster and longer than the\noutflow jets directed towards the magnetic island that forms between the two\ncurrent sheets. The X-line and flow stagnation point are located near the\ntrailing end of each current sheet very close to the obstructed exit. The speed\nof X-line retreat ranges from ~0.02-0.06 while the speed of stagnation point\nretreat ranges from ~0.03-0.07, in units of the initial upstream Alfven\nvelocity. Early in time, the flow stagnation point is located closer to the\ncenter of the current sheet than the X-line, but later on the relative\npositions of these two points switch. Consequently, late in time there is\nsignificant plasma flow across the X-line in the opposite direction of X-line\nretreat. Throughout the simulation, the velocity at the X-line does not equal\nthe velocity of the X-line. Motivated by these results, an expression for the\nrate of X-line retreat is derived in terms of local parameters at the X-point.\nThis expression shows that X-line retreat is due to both advection by the bulk\nplasma flow and diffusion of the normal component of the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 20:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 15:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}

Near room temperature, switching is governed by thermally\nactivated field emission from the nanowire gate. Below T=150 K, a crossover to\nquantum field emission is observed that is sensitive to structural phase\ntransitions in the SrTiO3 layer. This direct measurement of the source-drain\nand gate-drain energy barriers is crucial for the development of\nroom-temperature logic and memory elements and low-temperature quantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 21:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We\nentertain here the question of this asymptotic value, and we derive torque\nformulae which give the total torque as a function of the disk's viscosity and\nthermal diffusivity. The horseshoe drag features two components: one which\nscales with the vortensity gradient, and one which scales with the entropy\ngradient, and which constitutes the most promising candidate for halting inward\ntype I migration. Our analysis, which is complemented by numerical simulations,\nrecovers characteristics already noted by numericists, namely that the viscous\ntimescale across the horseshoe region must be shorter than the libration time\nin order to avoid saturation, and that, provided this condition is satisfied,\nthe entropy related part of the horseshoe drag remains large if the thermal\ntimescale is shorter than the libration time. Side results include a study of\nthe Lindblad torque as a function of thermal diffusivity, and a contribution to\nthe corotation torque arising from vortensity viscously created at the contact\ndiscontinuities that appear at the horseshoe separatrices.

We report the first detailed X-ray study of the supernova remnant (SNR)\nG304.6+0.1, achieved with the XMM-Newton mission. Methods. The powerful imaging\ncapability of XMM-Newton was used to study the X-ray characteristics of the\nremnant at different energy ranges. The X-ray morphology and spectral\nproperties were analyzed. In addittion, radio and mid-infrared data obtained\nwith the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the Spitzer Space\nTelescope were used to study the association with the detected X-ray emission\nand to understand the structure of the SNR at differents wavelengths. Results.\nThe SNR shows an extended and arc-like internal structure in the X-ray band\nwith out a compact point-like source inside the remnant. We find a high column\ndensity of NH in the range 2.5-3.5x1022 cm-2, which supports a relatively\ndistant location (d $\\geq$ 9.7 kpc). The X-ray spectrum exhibits at least three\nemission lines, indicating that the X-ray emission has a thin thermal plasma\norigin, although a non-thermal contribution cannot be discarded. The spectra of\nthree different regions (north, center and south) are well represented by a\ncombination of a non-equilibrium ionization (PSHOCK) and a power-law (PL)\nmodel.

One puzzle is that the stars' rotational\nvelocities are different from each other, and considerably slower than\nsynchronous with the orbital period.

Incorporating these results into our existing database of PN\nabundances yielded a sample of 124 well-observed objects with\nhomogeneously-determined abundances extending from 0.9-21 kpc in galactocentric\ndistance.

While we see\nsome evidence that the gradient steepens at large galactocentric distances,\nmore objects toward the anticenter need to be observed in order to confidently\nestablish the true form of the metallicity gradient.

First, we show that if a commutative\nsemigroup variety is a modular element of the lattice Com of all commutative\nsemigroup varieties then it is either the variety COM of all commutative\nsemigroups or a nil-variety or the join of a nil-variety with the variety of\nsemilattices. Second, we prove that if a commutative nil-variety is a modular\nelement of Com then it may be given within COM by 0-reduced and substitutive\nidentities only. Third, we completely classify all lower-modular elements of\nCom. As a corollary, we prove that an element of Com is modular whenever it is\nlower-modular. All these results are precise analogues of results concerning\nmodular and lower-modular elements of the lattice of all semigroup varieties\nobtained earlier by Jezek, McKenzie, Vernikov, and the author. As an\napplication of a technique developed in this paper, we provide new proofs of\nthe `prototypes' of the first and the third our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 04:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-13"}

Numerical simulations suggest that stars in this era were\nvery massive, 25 - 500 solar masses, with H II regions of up to 30,000\nlight-years in diameter.

Observations include spectro-imaging with\nXMM-Newton EPIC camera, multi-object spectroscopy (260 new redshifts), and\nwide-field imaging at the ESO 3.6m and 2.2m telescopes.

Idealized numerical simulations\nwere used to constrain the merging scenario for each system. We show that A2933\nis very likely an equal-mass advanced pre-merger ~ 200 Myr before the core\ncollapse, while A2440 and A2384 are post-merger systems ~ 450 Myr and ~1.5 Gyr\nafter core collapse, respectively). In the case of A2384, we detect a\nspectacular filament of galaxies and gas spreading over more than 1 h^{-1} Mpc,\nwhich we infer to have been stripped during the previous collision. The\nanalysis of the MUSIC sample allows us to outline some general properties of\nmerging clusters: a strong luminosity segregation of galaxies in recent\npost-mergers; the existence of preferential axes --corresponding to the merging\ndirections-- along which the BCGs and structures on various scales are aligned;\nthe concomitance, in most major merger cases, of secondary merging or accretion\nevents, with groups infalling onto the main cluster, and in some cases the\nevidence of previous merging episodes in one of the main components. These\nresults are in good agreement with the hierarchical scenario of structure\nformation, in which clusters are expected to form by successive merging events,\nand matter is accreted along large--scale filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 09:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The deterministic 2D Cellular\nautomata model captures the human facial expressions, both spontaneous and\nposed. The determinism stems from the fact that the facial muscle actions are\nstandardized by the encodings of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and Action\nUnits (AUs). Based on these encodings, we generate the set of evolutionary\nupdate rules of the DCA for each facial expression. We consider a\nPerson-Independent Facial Expression Space (PIFES) to analyze the facial\nexpressions based on Partitioned 2D-Cellular Automata which capture the\ndynamics of facial expressions and classify the shots based on it. Target video\nshot is retrieved by comparing the similar expression is obtained for the query\nframe's face with respect to the key faces expressions in the database video.\nConsecutive key face expressions in the database that are highly similar to the\nquery frame's face, then the key faces are used to generate the set of\nretrieved video shots from the database. A concrete example of its application\nwhich realizes an affective interaction between the computer and the user is\nproposed. In the affective interaction, the computer can recognize the facial\nexpression of any given video shot. This interaction endows the computer with\ncertain ability to adapt to the user's feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 11:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-13"}

A design study for ET is currently underway, so it is\ntimely to assess the science that could be done with such an instrument. This\npaper is the first in a series that will carry out a detailed study of\nintermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) for ET. In the context of ET, an IMRI\nis the inspiral of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole into an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH). In this paper we focus on the development\nof IMRI waveform models for circular and equatorial inspirals. We consider two\napproximations for the waveforms, which both incorporate the inspiral, merger\nand ringdown phases in a consistent way. One approximation, valid for IMBHs of\narbitrary spin, uses the transition model of Ori and Thorne [1] to describe the\nmerger, and this is then matched smoothly onto a ringdown waveform. The second\napproximation uses the Effective One Body (EOB) approach to model the merger\nphase of the waveform and is valid for non-spinning IMBHs. In this paper, we\nuse both waveform models to compute signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for IMRI\nsources detectable by ET. At a redshift of z=1, we find typical SNRs for IMRI\nsystems with masses 1.4+100 solar masses, 10+100 solar masses, 1.4+500 solar\nmasses and 10+500 solar masses of about 10-25, 40-80, 3-15 and 10-60,\nrespectively.

We\nwill outline ways of doing so by iteratively linking particles to their\nenvironment.

Responsibility captures the notion of degree of causality and\nserves to rank potentially many causes by their relative contributions to the\neffect.

In the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE),\nquasi-particles made of electrons take the role of anyons whose statistical\nexchange phase is fixed by the filling factor. Here we propose an experimental\nsetup to create anyons in one-dimensional lattices with fully tuneable exchange\nstatistics. In our setup, anyons are created by bosons with\noccupation-dependent hopping amplitudes, which can be realized by assisted\nRaman tunneling. The statistical angle can thus be controlled in situ by\nmodifying the relative phase of external driving fields. This opens the\nfascinating possibility of smoothly transmuting bosons via anyons into fermions\nand of inducing a phase transition by the mere control of the particle\nstatistics as a free parameter. In particular, we demonstrate how to induce a\nquantum phase transition from a superfluid into an exotic Mott-like state where\nthe particle distribution exhibits plateaus at fractional densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 15:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2011 11:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-29"}

The top degree\nhomogeneous component of every Laguerre symmetric function coincides with the\nSchur function with the same index. Thus, the Laguerre symmetric functions form\na two-parameter family of inhomogeneous bases in the algebra of symmetric\nfunctions. These new symmetric functions are obtained from the N-variate\nsymmetric polynomials of the same name by a procedure of analytic continuation.\nThe Laguerre symmetric functions are eigenvectors of a second order\ndifferential operator, which depends on the same two parameters and serves as\nthe infinitesimal generator of an infinite-dimensional diffusion process X(t).\nThe process X(t) admits approximation by some jump processes related to one\nmore new family of symmetric functions, the Meixner symmetric functions. In\nequilibrium, the process X(t) can be interpreted as a time-dependent point\nprocess on the punctured real line R\\{0}, and the point configurations may be\ninterpreted as doubly infinite collections of particles of two opposite charges\nwith log-gas-type interaction. The dynamical correlation functions of the\nequilibrium process have determinantal form: they are given by minors of the\nso-called extended Whittaker kernel, introduced earlier in a paper by Borodin\nand the author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 15:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}
