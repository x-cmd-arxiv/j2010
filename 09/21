An appreciable dependence of the line-shape on\ntemperature is observed for the first two peaks only. We demonstrate the\nexciton peak at 10.4 eV to have a very good Lorentzian band-shape at all the\nexamined temperatures. Based on existing theoretical models, this allows to\nargue excitons in SiO2 to be weakly scattered by phonons, thus retaining their\nmobility properties notwithstanding the effects of exciton-phonon coupling and\nof intrinsic structural disorder of amorphous SiO2. Moreover, the observed\ntemperature dependence of the peak position together with the features of the\nUrbach absorption tail and of self-trapped exciton emission allow us to\nestimate the main parameters ruling exciton dynamics in SiO2. The features of\nthe intrinsic Urbach absorption tail can be satisfactorily explained as a\nconsequence of those of the first excitonic peak, supporting the interpretation\nof the Urbach tail in SiO2 as a consequence of the momentary self-trapping of\nthe 10.4 eV exciton.

In general, these systems have infinitely\nmany solutions. However, it may be shown that sufficiently sparse solutions may\nbe identified uniquely. In other words, the corresponding linear transformation\nwill be invertible if we restrict its domain to sufficiently sparse vectors.\nThis property may be used, for example, to solve the underdetermined Blind\nSource Separation (BSS) problem, or to find sparse representation of a signal\nin an `overcomplete' dictionary of primitive elements (i.e., the so-called\natomic decomposition). The main drawback of current methods of finding sparse\nsolutions is their computational complexity. In this paper, we will show that\nby detecting `active' components of the (potential) solution, i.e., those\ncomponents having a considerable value, a framework for fast solution of the\nproblem may be devised. The idea leads to a family of algorithms, called\n`Iterative Detection-Estimation (IDE)', which converge to the solution by\nsuccessive detection and estimation of its active part. Comparing the\nperformance of IDE(s) with one of the most successful method to date, which is\nbased on Linear Programming (LP), an improvement in speed of about two to three\norders of magnitude is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 17:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

Depending on chemical pretreatment different\npurification processes are applied to prepare the clean surface in UHV. A\nstructure of the Si(001) surface which may affect MBE was studied by STM and\nRHEED. Experiments were carried out in UHV using the Riber SSC2 instrument\ncoupled with GPI-300 STM. Si wafers were either etched beforehand in the\nsolutions of RCA or HF and HNO3 mixture or passivated in the HF solutions. The\n(2x1) reconstruction was found to mainly arise in UHV after deoxidization\nprocesses such as high-temperature annealing or SiO2 removal by a weak flux of\nSi. The c(8x8) structure was also often observed by STM at room temperature and\nfound to occupy whole surface or a part of it depending on sample cooling rate\nand chemical pretreatment. The c(8x8) structure observed by STM was evidenced\nto correspond to (4x4) one in the RHEED patterns; the later replaced (2x1) when\nthe samples were cooled below 600C and turned out to be reversible with the\ntransition point of ~600C. A structural model of the c(8x8) surface and a\npathway of its formation in assumption of surface stress field self ordering\nare proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 18:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 07:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}

Using the recent results on the size-asymptotic\n(in the number of antennas) outage capacity distribution, the finite-SNR,\nsize-asymptotic DMT is derived for a broad class of fading distributions. The\nSNR range over which the finite-SNR DMT is accurately approximated by the\nSNR-asymptotic one is characterized. The multiplexing gain definition is shown\nto affect critically this range and thus should be carefully selected, so that\nthe SNR-asymptotic DMT is an accurate approximation at realistic SNR values and\nthus has operational significance to be used as a design criteria. The finite\nSNR diversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance in\na broad class of fading channels, and such an effect is described in a compact,\nclosed form. Complete characterization of the outage probability (or outage\ncapacity) requires not only the finite-SNR DMT, but also the SNR offset, which\nis introduced and investigated as well. This offset, which is not accounted for\nin the DMT framework, is shown to have a significant impact on the outage\nprobability for a broad class of fading channels, especially when the\nmultiplexing gain is small.

The near uniformity of the magnetic field\nstrength across a front is consistent with the flat field strength-gas density\nrelation that is observed in diffuse interstellar gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The current bound on the spin-independent scattering\ncross section is sigma^SI < 10 zb for dark matter masses m_chi ~ 100 GeV, with\nimproved sensitivities expected soon. We examine the implications of this\nprogress for neutralino dark matter. We work in a supersymmetric framework\nwell-suited to dark matter studies that is simple and transparent, with models\ndefined in terms of four weak-scale parameters. We first show that robust\nconstraints on electric dipole moments motivate large sfermion masses mtilde >\n1 TeV, effectively decoupling squarks and sleptons from neutralino dark matter\nphenomenology. In this case, we find characteristic cross sections in the\nnarrow range 1 zb < sigma^SI < 40 zb for m_chi > 70 GeV. As sfermion masses are\nlowered to near their experimental limit mtilde ~ 400 GeV, the upper and lower\nlimits of this range are extended, but only by factors of around two, and the\nlower limit is not significantly altered by relaxing many particle physics\nassumptions, varying the strange quark content of the nucleon, including the\neffects of galactic small-scale structure, or assuming other components of dark\nmatter. Experiments are therefore rapidly entering the heart of dark\nmatter-favored supersymmetry parameter space. If no signal is seen,\nsupersymmetric models must contain some level of fine-tuning, and we identify\nand analyze several possibilities.

Barring very specialized models such as product-form\ntype queueing networks, there exist very few results which provide provable\nnon-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on key performance measures. In this\npaper we propose a new performance analysis method, which is based on the\nrobust optimization. The basic premise of our approach is as follows: rather\nthan assuming that the stochastic primitives of a queueing model satisfy\ncertain probability laws, such as, for example, i.i.d. interarrival and service\ntimes distributions, we assume that the underlying primitives are deterministic\nand satisfy the implications of such probability laws. These implications take\nthe form of simple linear constraints, namely, those motivated by the Law of\nthe Iterated Logarithm (LIL).\n  Using this approach we are able to obtain performance bounds on some key\nperformance measures. Furthermore, these performance bounds imply similar\nbounds in the underlying stochastic queueing models.\n  We demonstrate our approach on two types of queueing networks: a) Tandem\nSingle Class queue- ing network and b) Multiclass Single Server queueing\nnetwork. In both cases, using the proposed robust optimization approach, we are\nable to obtain explicit upper bounds on some steady-state performance measures.\nFor example, for the case of TSC system we obtain a bound of the form\n$\\frac{C}{1-\\rho} \\ln \\ln(1/(1-\\rho))$ on the expected steady-state sojourn\ntime, where C is an explicit constant and $\\rho$ is the bottleneck traffic\nintensity. This qualitatively agrees with the correct heavy traffic scaling of\nthis performance measure up to the $ln ln(1/(1-\\rho))$ correction factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 20:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-22"}

RSR is a graph renormalization procedure that locally\naggregates nodes to produce a coarse grained network. It is analogous to the\n(quasi-)parallel renormalization schemes introduced by C. Song {\\it et al.}\n(Nature {\\bf 433}, 392 (2005)) and studied more recently by F. Radicchi {\\it et\nal.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 101}, 148701 (2008)), but much simpler and easier\nto implement. In this first paper we apply RSR to critical trees and derive\nanalytical results consistent with numerical simulations. Critical trees\nexhibit three regimes in their evolution under RSR: (i) An initial regime\n$N_0^{\\nu}\\lesssim N<N_0$, where $N$ is the number of nodes at some step in the\nrenormalization and $N_0$ is the initial size. RSR in this regime is described\nby a mean field theory and fluctuations from one realization to another are\nsmall. The exponent $\\nu=1/2$ is derived using random walk arguments. The\ndegree distribution becomes broader under successive renormalization --\nreaching a power law, $p_k\\sim 1/k^{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma=2$ and a variance\nthat diverges as $N_0^{1/2}$ at the end of this regime.

While this strategy has not been fully implemented, it can be used to\nestablish partial results, such as being able to determine the \\emph{parity} of\nthe number of primes in a given interval in $[N,2N]$ in time $O(N^{1/2-c})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 21:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 23:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 17:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 May 2012 04:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}

We consider the scenario in which\nthe scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information,\nbut instead estimates the channel state information by exploiting the memory\ninherent in the Markov channels along with ARQ-styled feedback from the\nscheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: (1)\nChannel estimation and rate adaptation to maximize the expected immediate rate\nof the scheduled user; (2) User scheduling, based on the optimized immediate\nrate, to maximize the overall long term sum-throughput of the downlink. The\nscheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with the\nclassic 'exploitation vs exploration' trade-off that is difficult to quantify.\nWe therefore study the problem in the framework of Restless Multi-armed Bandit\nProcesses (RMBP) and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle's\nindexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the index\npolicy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimality\nproperties in various settings.

MCs can start out as cold atomic clouds formed by\ncompressive motions in the warm neutral medium (WNM) of galaxies. Such motions\ncan be driven by large-scale instabilities, or by local turbulence. The\ncompressions induce a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM) to form\ngrowing cold atomic clouds, which in their early stages may constitute thin CNM\nsheets. Several dynamical instabilities soon destabilize a cloud, rendering it\nturbulent. For solar neighborhood conditions, a cloud is coincidentally\nexpected to become molecular, magnetically supercritical, and gravitationally\ndominated at roughly the same column density, $N \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^21 \\psc\n\\approx 10 \\Msun$ pc$^{-2}$. At this point, the cloud begins to contract\ngravitationally. However, before its global collapse is completed ($\\sim 10^7$\nyr later), the nonlinear density fluctuations within the cloud, which have\nshorter local free-fall times, collapse first and begin forming stars, a few\nMyr after the global contraction started. Large-scale fluctuations of lower\nmean densities collapse later, so the formation of massive star-forming regions\nis expected to occur late in the evolution of a large cloud complex, while\nscattered low-mass regions are expected to form earlier. Eventually, the local\nstar formation episodes are terminated by stellar feedback, which disperses the\nlocal dense gas, although more work is necessary to clarify the details and\ncharacteristic scales of this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 22:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-22"}

Support for this viewpoint comes from previous calculations\ninvoking conformal symmetry in the near-horizon region, which give radiation\nrates that are identical to those of a single 1D quantum channel connected to a\nthermal reservoir at the Hawking temperature. The Landauer approach shows in a\ndirect way the particle statistics independence of the energy and entropy\nfluxes of a black hole radiating into vacuum, as well as one near thermal\nequilibrium with its environment.

In this paper we investigate the theoretical and\npractical issues of Zhang [Manufacturing and Services Operations Management 6-2\n(2004b) 195] with the purpose of quantifying the bullwhip effect. Considering a\ntwo-stage supply chain, the bullwhip effect is measured for an ARMA(p,q) demand\nprocess admitting an infinite moving average representation.

To obtain the\nactual condition for this cooperation, a multi-layered network based on two\ndifferent types of data was investigated. The first type was transaction data\nfrom Japanese firms. The network created from the data included 961,363 firms\nand 7,808,760 links. The second type of data were from joint-patent\napplications in Japan.

The total amount of money and transactions have few\nrelationships and these are probably connected to joint-patent applications in\ndifferent mechanisms.

In either\nsetting, filaments are shown to connect onto halos, outskirt walls, which\ncircumvent voids. Indeed this algorithm operates directly on the particles\nwithout assuming anything about the distribution, and yields a natural\n(topologically motivated) self-consistent criterion for selecting the\nsignificance level of the identified structures. It is shown that this\nextraction is possible even for very sparsely sampled point processes, as a\nfunction of the persistence ratio. Hence astrophysicists should be in a\nposition to trace and measure precisely the filaments, walls and voids from\nsuch samples and assess the confidence of the post-processed sets as a function\nof this threshold, which can be expressed relative to the expected amplitude of\nshot noise. In a cosmic framework, this criterion is comparable to friend of\nfriend for the identifications of peaks, while it also identifies the connected\nfilaments and walls, and quantitatively recovers the full set of topological\ninvariants (Betti numbers) {\\sl directly from the particles} as a function of\nthe persistence threshold. This criterion is found to be sufficient even if one\nparticle out of two is noise, when the persistence ratio is set to 3-sigma or\nmore. The algorithm is also implemented on the SDSS catalogue and used to locat\ninteresting configurations of the filamentary structure. In this context we\ncarried the identification of an ``optically faint'' cluster at the\nintersection of filaments through the recent observation of its X-ray\ncounterpart by SUZAKU.

To achieve that goal, the method works directly over\nthe Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the DTFE density\ncomputed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing\nof the density field is required.\n  The idea is based on recent advances in distinct sub-domains of computational\ntopology, which allows a rigorous application of topological principles to\nastrophysical data sets, taking into account uncertainties and Poisson noise.\nPractically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of\nrobustness with respect to noise (defined as a \"number of sigmas\") and the\nalgorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of\ncritical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters,\nfilaments, walls and voids; filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling\nalong the edges of walls bounding the voids. The method is also interesting as\nit allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a\ndiscrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics,\nwithout having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale.\n  In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and\ndescribe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D\nsimulated and observed data sets to the companion paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 07:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

For a phase shift of pi/2\nbetween scattered and unscattered electrons induced by a physical phase plate,\nthe sine-type phase contrast transfer function is converted into a cosine-type\nfunction. Optimal imaging conditions could theoretically be achieved if the\nphase shifts caused by the objective lens defocus and lens aberrations would be\nequal zero.

With the advent of lower-cost, higher-mass transport\nto orbit, the options for further space development (e.g., communications,\nspace solar power, radiation dampers, sun shades, and permanent LEO habitation)\nare greatly expanded.

The material's effect on the timeline for the system development\nindicates the feasibility of near-term implementation of the system (possibly\nwithin the decade).

Annihilation rates measured as a function of\npositron energy reveal the presence of vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR)\nfor many polyatomic molecules. These resonances lead to strong enhancement of\nthe annihilation rates. They also provide evidence that positrons bind to many\nmolecular species. A quantitative theory of VFR-mediated attachment to small\nmolecules is presented. It is tested successfully for selected molecules (e.g.,\nmethyl halides and methanol) where all modes couple to the positron continuum.\nCombination and overtone resonances are observed and their role is elucidated.\nIn larger molecules, annihilation rates from VFR far exceed those explicable on\nthe basis of single-mode resonances. These enhancements increase rapidly with\nthe number of vibrational degrees of freedom. While the details are as yet\nunclear, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution to states that do not\ncouple directly to the positron continuum appears to be responsible for these\nenhanced annihilation rates. Downshifts of the VFR from the vibrational mode\nenergies have provided binding energies for thirty species. Their dependence\nupon molecular parameters and their relationship to positron-atom and\npositron-molecule binding energy calculations are discussed. Feshbach\nresonances and positron binding to molecules are compared with the analogous\nelectron-molecule (negative ion) cases. The relationship of VFR-mediated\nannihilation to other phenomena such as Doppler-broadening of the gamma-ray\nannihilation spectra, annihilation of thermalized positrons in gases, and\nannihilation-induced fragmentation of molecules is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 12:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-22"}

Particular emphasis is placed on the strong resonance lines belonging\nto the lithium isoelectronic sequence. Predictions for emission lines observed\nby existing space-based UV spectrometers are given. The effects on the\nstatistics of a line when observed with a wide-band imaging instrument rather\nthan a spectrometer are also investigated. We use a hydrodynamic model to\nsimulate the UV emission of a loop system heated by nanoflares on small,\nspatially unresolved scales. We select lines emitted at similar temperatures\nbut belonging to different isoelectronic groups: Fe IX and Ne VIII, Fe XII and\nMg X, Fe XVII, Fe XIX and Fe XXIV. Our simulations confirm previous results\nthat almost all lines have an intensity distribution that follows a power-law,\nin a similar way to the heating function. However, only the high temperature\nlines best preserve the heating function's power law index (Fe XIX being the\nbest ion in the case presented here). The Li isoelectronic lines have different\nstatistical properties with respect to the lines from other sequences, due to\nthe extended high temperature tail of their contribution functions. However,\nthis is not the case for Fe XXIV which may be used as a diagnostic of the\ncoronal heating function. We also show that the power-law index of the heating\nfunction is effectively preserved when a line is observed by a wide-band\nimaging instrument rather than a spectromenter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2010 14:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-22"}

It is argued\nthat the boundary layer between the Keplerian accretion disk and the event\nhorizon is best suited for the formation and acceleration of the\naccretion-powered jets in active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.\n  The model is based on matching the solutions of three different regions: i- a\nweakly magnetized Keplerian accretion disk in the outer part, where the\ntransport of angular momentum is mediated through the magentorotational\ninstability, ii- a strongly magnetized, advection-dominated and turbulent-free\nboundary layer (BL) between the outer cold accretion disk and the event\nhorizon, where the plasma rotates sub-Keplerian and iii- a transition zone (TZ)\nbetween the BL and the overlying corona, where the electrons and protons are\nthermally uncoupled, highly dissipative and rotate super-Keplerian.\n  Our model predicts the known correlation between the Lorentz-factor and the\nspin parameter of the BH.
