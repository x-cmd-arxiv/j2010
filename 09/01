Instead of returning all the answers, such\nqueries return only the best answers, according to a given preference relation.\nPreference queries are a fast growing area of database research. Skyline\nqueries constitute one of the most thoroughly studied classes of preference\nqueries. A well known limitation of skyline queries is that skyline preference\nrelations assign the same importance to all attributes. In this work, we study\np-skyline queries that generalize skyline queries by allowing varying attribute\nimportance in preference relations. We perform an in-depth study of the\nproperties of p-skyline preference relations. In particular,we study the\nproblems of containment and minimal extension. We apply the obtained results to\nthe central problem of the paper: eliciting relative importance of attributes.\nRelative importance is implicit in the constructed p-skyline preference\nrelation.

We also built a 3D model of the structure of the stellar wind to\nreproduce the observed variability. We first derived a refined orbital solution\nbuilt from INTEGRAL, RXTE and XMM data. The XMM monitoring campaign revealed\nsignificant variation of intrinsic absorbing column density along the orbit and\nof the Fe K{\\alpha} line equivalent width around the eclipses. The origin of\nthe soft X-ray absorption is modeled with an dense and extended hydrodynamical\ntail, trailing the neutron star. This structure extends along most of the\norbit, indicating that the stellar wind is strongly disrupted by the neutron\nstar. The variability of the absorbing column density suggests that the\nterminal velocity of the wind is smaller (~400 km/s) than observed in classical\nsystems. This can also explain the much stronger density perturbation inferred\nfrom the observations. Most of the Fe K{\\alpha} emission is generated in the\nmost inner region of the hydrodynamical tail. This region, that extends over a\nfew accretion radii, is ionized and does not contribute to the soft X-ray\nabsorption.

New hard X-ray images of\nEta Car were studied close to periastron, and compared to previous observations\nfar from periastron.\n  Results: The INTEGRAL component, when represented by a power law (with a\nphoton index of 1.8), would produce more emission in the Chandra band than\nobserved from any point source in the ISGRI error circle apart from Eta Car, as\nlong as the hydrogen column density to the ISGRI source is lower than 1E24\ncm^{-2}. Such sources are rare, thus the ISGRI emission is very likely to be\nassociated with Eta Car. The eventual contribution of the outer shell to the\nnon-thermal component also remains fairly limited. Close to periastron, a\n3-sigma detection is achieved for the hard X-ray emission of Eta Car, with a\nflux similar to the average value far from periastron.\n  Conclusions: Assuming a single absorption component for both the thermal and\nnon-thermal sources, this detection can be explained with a hydrogen column\ndensity that does not exceed 6E23 cm^{-2} without resorting to an intrinsic\nincrease in the hard X-ray emission. The energy injected in hard X-rays\n(averaged over a month) appears rather constant as close as a few stellar\nradii, well within the acceleration region of the wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 17:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-13"}

We\nmodel the binary components as main-sequence stars with initial masses of 1, 3\nand 6 Solar masses, and with chemical composition profiles taken from stellar\nevolution codes. Outcomes of the close interactions include mergers, collisions\nthat leave both stars intact, and ejection of one star at high velocity\naccompanied by capture of the other star into a tight orbit around the SMBH.\nFor the first time, we follow the evolution of the collision products for many\n($\\gtrsim 100$) orbits around the SMBH. Stars that are initially too small to\nbe tidally disrupted by the SMBH can be puffed up by close encounters or\ncollisions, with the result that tidal stripping occurs in subsequent periapse\npassages. In these cases, mass loss occurs episodically, sometimes for hundreds\nof orbits before the star is completely disrupted. Repeated tidal flares, of\neither increasing or decreasing intensity, are a predicted consequence. In\ncollisions involving a low-mass and a high-mass star, the merger product\nacquires a high core hydrogen abundance from the smaller star, effectively\nresetting the nuclear evolution \"clock\" to a younger age. Elements like Li, Be\nand B that can exist only in the outermost envelope of a star are severely\ndepleted due to envelope ejection during collisions and due to tidal forces\nfrom the SMBH. In the absence of collisions, tidal spin-up of stars is only\nimportant in a narrow range of periapse distances, $r_t/2\\lesssim r_per\n\\lesssim r_t$ with $r_t$ the tidal disruption radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 17:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 18:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 01:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Our survey, in combination with the Arecibo survey by\nStanimirovic et al., shows that the MS gas is continuous in this region and\nthat the MS is at least ~140 degrees long. We identify a new filament on the\neastern side of the MS that significantly deviates from the equator of the MS\ncoordinate system for more than ~45 degrees. Additionally, we find a previously\nunknown velocity inflection in the MS-tip near MS longitude L_MS=-120 degrees\nat which the velocity reaches a minimum and then starts to increase. We find\nthat five compact high velocity clouds cataloged by de Heij et al. as well as\nWright's Cloud are plausibly associated with the MS because they match the MS\nin position and velocity. The mass of the newly-confirmed ~40 degree extension\nof the MS-tip is ~2x10^7 Msun (d/120 kpc)^2 (including Wright's Cloud increases\nthis by ~50%) and increases the total mass of the MS by ~4%.

From\nour combined map of the entire MS, we find that the total column density\n(integrated transverse to the MS) drops markedly along the MS and follows an\nexponential decline with L_MS. We estimate that the age of the ~140 degree-long\nMS is ~2.5 Gyr which coincides with bursts of star formation in the Magellanic\nClouds and a possible close encounter of these two galaxies with each other\nthat could have triggered the formation of the MS.

The NIR imaging data reach K ~ 23-24 Vega magnitude and\nthey allow us to construct a nearly stellar mass-limited sample down to ~\n10^{9.5-10} Msun even at z~3.

Galaxies in the low-SSFR group\nhave SSFRs of ~ 0.5-1.0 Gyr^{-1}, while the high-SSFR population shows ~10\nGyr^{-1}. The cosmic SFRD is dominated by galaxies with Mstar = 10^{10-11} Msun\nat 0.5<z<3.5, while the contribution of massive galaxies with Mstar =\n10^{11-11.5} Msun shows a strong evolution at z>1 and becomes significant at\nz~3, especially in the case with the SFR based on MIPS 24um. In galaxies with\nMstar = 10^{10-11.5} Msun, those with a relatively narrow range of SSFR (<~1\ndex) dominates the cosmic SFRD at 0.5<z<3.5.

At 2.5<z<3.5, the\nhigh-SSFR population, which is relatively small in number, dominates the SFRD.\nMajor star formation in the universe at higher redshift seems to be associated\nwith a more rapid growth of stellar mass of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-11"}

The\napplication of the method is performed with the statistical construction of\nsynthetic color-magnitude diagrams using PMS evolutionary models. We convert\neach isochrone into 2D probability distributions of artificial PMS stars in the\nCMD by applying the aforementioned biases that dislocate these stars from their\noriginal CMD positions. A maximum-likelihood technique is then applied to\nderive the probability for each observed star to have a certain age, as well as\nthe best age for the entire cluster. We apply our method to the photometric\ncatalog of ~2000 PMS stars in the young association LH 95 in the LMC, based on\nthe deepest HST/ACS imaging ever performed toward this galaxy, with a detection\nlimit of V~28, corresponding to M~0.2 Msun. Our treatment shows that the age\ndetermination is very sensitive to the considered grid of evolutionary models\nand the assumed binary fraction. The age of LH 95 is found to vary from 2.8 Myr\nto 4.4 Myr, depending on these factors. Our analysis allows us to disentangle a\nreal age-spread from the apparent CMD-broadening caused by the physical and\nobservational biases. We find that LH 95 hosts an age-spread well represented\nby a gaussian distribution with a FWHM of the order of 2.8 Myr to 4.2 Myr\ndepending on the model and binary fraction. We detect a dependence of the\naverage age of the system with stellar mass.

We find that the introduction of a\nfinite sound speed into the picture necessarily induces a scale-dependence in\nthe dark energy clustering, which in turn affects the dynamics of the spherical\ncollapse in a scale-dependent way. As with other, more conventional fluids, we\ncan define a Jeans scale for the dark energy clustering, and hence a Jeans mass\nM_J for the dark matter which feels the effect of dark energy clustering via\ngravitational interactions. For bound objects (halos) with masses M >> M_J, the\neffect of dark energy clustering is maximal. For those with M << M_J, the dark\nenergy component is effectively homogeneous, and its role in the formation of\nthese structures is reduced to its effects on the Hubble expansion rate. To\ncompute quantitatively the virial density and the linearly extrapolated\nthreshold density, we use a quasi-linear approach which is expected to be valid\nup to around the Jeans mass. We find an interesting dependence of these\nquantities on the halo mass M, given some w and c_s. The dependence is the\nstrongest for masses lying in the vicinity of M ~ M_J.

The group akin to the thin\ndisk is traced by stars with [Fe/H]>-0.7 and alpha/Fe<0.2. The thick disk-like\ngroup overlaps the thin disk in [Fe/H] but has higher abundances of alpha\nelements and Eu.

The velocity dispersion of\nstars assigned to the thin disk is also independent of [Fe/H], implying that\nthe familiar increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing metallicity is the\nresult of the increased prevalence of the thick disk at lower metallicities,\nrather than of the sustained operation of a dynamical heating mechanism.

In \"subluminal\" shocks, where relativistic particles can\nescape ahead of the shock along the magnetic field lines, ions are efficiently\naccelerated via a Fermi-like mechanism. The downstream ion spectrum consists of\na relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail, which contains ~5%\nof ions and ~30% of ion energy. Its slope is -2.1. Upstream electrons enter the\nshock with lower energy than ions, so they are more strongly tied to the field.\nAs a result, only ~1% of the incoming electrons are Fermi-accelerated at the\nshock before being advected downstream, where they populate a steep power-law\ntail (with slope -3.5). For \"superluminal\" shocks, where relativistic particles\ncannot outrun the shock along the field, the self-generated turbulence is not\nstrong enough to permit efficient Fermi acceleration, and the ion and electron\ndownstream spectra are consistent with thermal distributions. The incoming\nelectrons are heated up to equipartition with ions, due to strong\nelectromagnetic waves emitted by the shock into the upstream.

In a magnetic field perpendicular to the CuO(2) layers, H(perp), we\nobserve that the resistivity perpendicular to the layers, \\rho(perp), becomes\nfinite at a temperature consistent with previous studies on very similar\nmaterials; however, the onset of finite parallel resistivity, \\rho(par), occurs\nat a much higher temperature. This behavior contradicts conventional theory,\nwhich predicts that \\rho(perp) and \\rho(par) should become finite at the same\ntemperature. Voltage vs. current measurements near the threshold of voltage\ndetectability indicate linear behavior perpendicular to the layers, becoming\nnonlinear at higher currents, while the behavior is nonlinear from the onset\nparallel to the layers. These results, in the presence of moderate H(perp),\nappear consistent with superconducting order parallel to the layers with\nvoltage fluctuations between the layers due to thermal noise.

We calculate the fraction\nof extended emission as a function of wavelength for the galaxies in the\nsample, FEE_lambda. We can identify 3 general types of FEE_lambda: one where it\nis constant, one where features due to emission lines and PAHs appear more\nextended than the continuum, and a third which is characteristic of sources\nwith deep silicate absorption at 9.7um. More than 30% of the galaxies have a\nmedian FEE_lambda larger than 0.5 implying that at least half of their MIR\nemission is extended. Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) display a wide range\nof FEE in their warm dust continuum (0<=FEE_13.2um<=0.85). The large values of\nFEE_13.2um that we find in many LIRGs suggest that their extended MIR continuum\nemission originates in scales up to 10kpc. The mean size of the LIRG cores at\n13.2um is 2.6kpc. However, once the LIR of the systems reaches the threshold of\n~10^11.8Lsun, all sources become clearly more compact, with FEE_13.2um<=0.2,\nand their cores are unresolved. Our estimated upper limit for the core size of\nULIRGs is less than 1.5kpc. The analysis indicates that the compactness of\nsystems with LIR>~10^11.25Lsun strongly increases in those classified as\nmergers in their final stage of interaction. The FEE_13.2um is also related to\nthe contribution of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the MIR. Galaxies which\nare more AGN-dominated are less extended, independently of their LIR. We\nfinally find that the extent of the MIR continuum emission is correlated with\nthe far-IR IRAS log(f_60um/f_100um) color. This enables us to place a lower\nlimit to the area in a galaxy from where the cold dust emission may originate,\na prediction which can be tested soon with the Herschel Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 21:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Using the results for the random walk in random\nenvironment together with an appropriate coupling, we deduce the law of large\nnumbers for the stochastic billiard with a drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2010 23:10:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 23:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

Since four information symbols taken from an\nM-QAM constellation are selected to construct one Golden Code codeword, a\nmaximum likelihood decoder using sphere decoding has the worst-case complexity\nof O(M^4), when the Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the\nreceiver. Previously, this worst-case complexity was reduced to O(M^(2.5))\nwithout performance degradation. When the CSI is known by the transmitter as\nwell as the receiver, beamforming techniques that employ singular value\ndecomposition are commonly used in MIMO systems. In the absence of channel\ncoding, when a single symbol is transmitted, these systems achieve the full\ndiversity order provided by the channel.

However, uncoded multiple\nbeamforming can achieve the full diversity order by adding a properly designed\nconstellation precoder.

The nitrogen overabundance as a general feature of this type of stars is\nconfirmed. A majority of the stars has a nitrogen excess [N/Fe] between 0.2 and\n0.9 dex with the maximum position of the star's distribution on [N/Fe] between\n0.4 and 0.7 dex. The N excesses are discussed in light of predictions for\nB-type main sequence (MS) stars with rotationally induced mixing and for their\nnext evolutionary phase, i.e. A- and F-type supergiants that have experienced\nthe first dredge-up. Rotationally induced mixing in the MS progenitors of the\nsupergiants may be a significant cause of the nitrogen excesses. When comparing\nour results with predictions of the theory developed for stars with the mixing,\nwe find that the bulk of the supergiants (28 of 30) show the N enrichment that\ncan be expected (i) either after the MS phase for stars with the initial\nrotational velocities v0 = 200-400 km s-1, (ii) or after the first dredge-up\nfor stars with v0 = 50-400 km s-1. The latter possibility is preferred on\naccount of the longer lifetime for stars on red-blue loops following the first\ndredge-up. Two supergiants without a discernible N enrichment, namely HR 825\nand HR 7876, may be post-MS objects with the relatively low initial rotational\nvelocity of about 100 km s-1.

Thus, we solve an open problem of Duncan et\nal., which, when combined with their work, implies that we can produce a planar\nstraight-line drawing of a combinatorially-embedded genus-g graph with the\ngraph's canonical polygonal schema drawn as a convex polygonal external face.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 04:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}

We\ncompare their amplitude with the perturbative terms that can be obtained within\nthe fluid description of the system, to estimate the range of scales where such\nperturbative approaches are relevant. We use the simple Zeldovich dynamics as a\nbenchmark, as it allows the exact computation of the full nonlinear power\nspectrum and of perturbative terms at all orders. Then, we introduce a \"sticky\nmodel\" that coincides with the Zeldovich dynamics before shell crossing but\nshows a different behavior afterwards. Thus, their power spectra only differ in\ntheir nonperturbative terms. We consider both the real-space and redshift-space\npower spectra. We find that the potential of perturbative schemes is greater at\nhigher redshift for a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For the real-space power\nspectrum, one can go up to order $66$ of perturbation theory at $z=3$, and to\norder $9$ at $z=0$, before the nonperturbative correction surpasses the\nperturbative correction of that order. This allows us to increase the upper\nbound on $k$ where systematic theoretical predictions may be obtained by\nperturbative schemes, beyond the linear regime, by a factor $\\sim 26$ at $z=3$\nand $\\sim 6.5$ at $z=0$. This provides a strong motivation to study\nperturbative resummation schemes, especially at high redshifts $z \\geq 1$.

We aim to characterize the morphologies of the stellar\ncontinuum and the ionized gas (H_alpha) emissions from local sources, and\ninvestigate how they relate with the dynamical status and IR-luminosity of the\nsources. We use optical (5250 -- 7450 \\AA) integral field spectroscopic (IFS)\ndata for a sample of 38 sources, taken with the VIMOS instrument, on the VLT.\nWe present an atlas of IFS images of continuum emission, H_alpha emission, and\nH_alpha equivalent widths for the sample. The H_alpha images frequently reveal\nextended structures that are not visible in the continuum, such as HII regions\nin spiral arms, tidal tails, rings, of up to few kpc from the nuclear regions.\nThe morphologies of the continuum and H_alpha images are studied on the basis\nof the C_{2kpc} parameter, which measures the concentration of the emission\nwithin the central 2 kpc. The C_{2kpc} values found for the H_alpha images are\nhigher than those of the continuum for the majority (85%) of the objects in our\nsample. On the other hand, most of the objects in our sample (~62%) have more\nthan half of their H_alpha emission outside the central 2 kpc. No clear trends\nare found between the values of C_{2kpc} and the IR-luminosity of the sources.\nOn the other hand, our results suggest that the star formation in advance\nmergers and early-stage interactions is more concentrated than in isolated\nobjects. We compared the H_alpha and infrared emissions as tracers of the\nstar-formation activity. We find that the star-formation rates derived using\nthe H_alpha luminosities generally underpredict those derived using the IR\nluminosities, even after accounting for reddening effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 07:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 07:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We illustrate the work with a real case: the\nsolar-like star $\\eta$ Bootis. The modeling takes into account rotation effects\non the equilibrium models through an effective gravity and on the oscillation\nfrequencies through both perturbative and non-perturbative calculations. We\ncompare the results of both type of calculations in the context of the regular\nspacings (like the small spacings and the scaled small spacings) and echelle\ndiagrams. We show that for echelle diagrams the perturbative approach remains\nvalid for rotational velocities up to 40-50 km/s. We show that for the\nrotational velocities measured in solar-like stars, theoretical oscillation\nfrequencies must be corrected up to the second-order in terms of rotation rate,\nincluding near degeneracy effects. For rotational velocities of about 16 km/S\nand higher, diagnostics on large spacings and on modal identification through\nechelle diagrams can be significantly altered by the presence of the $m\\neq0$\ncomponents of the rotationally split modes. We found these effects to be\ndetectable in the observed frequency range. Analysis of the effects of rotation\non small spacings and scaled small spacings reveals that these can be of the\norder of, or even larger than surface effects, typically turbulence,\nmicroscopic diffusion, etc. Furthermore, we show that scaled spacings are\nsignificantly affected by stellar distortion even for small stellar rotational\nvelocities (from 10-15 km/s) and therefore some care must be taken when using\nthem as indicators for probing deep stellar interiors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 09:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-02"}

It has recently been proposed that the jets of low-luminosity radio\ngalaxies are powered by direct accretion of the hot phase of the IGM onto the\ncentral black hole. Cold gas remains a plausible alternative fuel supply,\nhowever. The most compelling evidence that cold gas plays a role in fueling\nradio galaxies is that dust is detected more commonly and/or in larger\nquantities in (elliptical) radio galaxies compared with radio-quiet elliptical\ngalaxies. On the other hand, only small numbers of radio galaxies have yet been\ndetected in CO (and even fewer imaged), and whether or not all radio galaxies\nhave enough cold gas to fuel their jets remains an open question. If so, then\nthe dynamics of the cold gas in the nuclei of radio galaxies may provide\nimportant clues to the fuelling mechanism. Aims. The only instrument capable of\nimaging the molecular component on scales relevant to the accretion process is\nALMA, but very little is yet known about CO in southern radio galaxies. Our aim\nis to measure the CO content in a complete volume-limited sample of southern\nradio galaxies, in order to create a well-defined list of nearby targets to be\nimaged in the near future with ALMA. Methods. APEX has recently been equipped\nwith a receiver (APEX-1) able to observe the 230 GHz waveband. This allows us\nto search for CO(2-1) line emission in our target galaxies. Results. Here we\npresent the results for our first three southern targets, proposed for APEX-1\nspectroscopy during science verification: NGC3557, IC4296 and NGC1399. The\nexperiment was successful with two targets detected, and possible indications\nfor a double-horned CO line profile, consistent with ordered rotation.

Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern\naround transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR)\nflanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density.\nWhile the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the\npositioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et\nal. argued that the pattern observed in S. cerevisiae is qualitatively\nconsistent with a `barrier nucleosome model', in which the oscillatory pattern\nis created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On\nthe other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of\nnucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect\nthe observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively\nanalyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs.\nOur analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which\nquantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes\nand their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the\ntwo sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by\nthe same physical model, with the same parameters, but different boundary\nconditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome\ndownstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned\nwhile the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a\nnucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be\nlocally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical\ndistribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ~1000 bp to each side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 12:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-02"}

After generation, the electron spin is stored in the quantum dot\nbefore being read out using an all optical implementation of spin to charge\nconversion technique, whereby the spin projection of the electron is mapped\nonto the more robust charge state of the quantum dot. After spin to charge\nconversion, the charge state of the dot is repeatedly tested by pumping a\nluminescence recycling transition to obtain strong readout signals. In\ncombination with spin manipulation using fast optical pulses or microwave\npulses, this provides an ideal basis for probing spin coherence in single\nself-assembled quantum dots over long timescales and developing optimal methods\nfor coherent spin control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 15:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

Two theories were considered for this\npurpose. The first, proposed by Garz\\'o and Dufty (GD) [Phys. Fluids {\\bf 14},\n146 (2002)], is based on the Boltzmann equation which does not incorporate\nfinite-volume effects, thereby limiting its use to dilute flows. The second,\nproposed by Garz\\'o, Hrenya and Dufty (GHD) [Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 76}, 31303 and\n031304 (2007)], is derived from the Enskog equation which does account for\nfinite-volume effects; accordingly this theory can be applied to moderately\ndense systems as well. To demonstrate the significance of the dense-phase\ntreatment relative to its dilute counterpart, the ratio of dense (GHD) to\ndilute (GD) predictions of all relevant transport coefficients and equations of\nstate are plotted over a range of physical parameters (volume fraction,\ncoefficients of restitution, material density ratio, diameter ratio, and\nmixture composition). These plots reveal the deviation between the two\ntreatments, which can become quite large ($>$100%) even at moderate values of\nthe physical parameters. Such information will be useful when choosing which\ntheory is most applicable to a given situation, since the dilute theory offers\nrelative simplicity and the dense theory offers improved accuracy. It is also\nimportant to note that several corrections to original GHD expressions are\npresented here in the form of a complete, self-contained set of relevant\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 15:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 16:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

Calvera was observed in the X-rays with XMM/EPIC\ntwice for a total exposure time of ~50 ks. The source spectrum is thermal and\nwell reproduced by a two component model composed of either two hydrogen\natmosphere models, or two blackbodies (kT_1~ 55/150 eV, kT_2~ 80/250 eV,\nrespectively, as measured at infinity). Evidence was found for an absorption\nfeature at ~0.65 keV; no power-law high-energy tail is statistically required.\nUsing pn and MOS data we discovered pulsations in the X-ray emission at a\nperiod P=59.2 ms. The detection is highly significant (> 11 sigma), and\nunambiguously confirms the neutron star nature of Calvera. The pulse profile is\nnearly sinusoidal, with a pulsed fraction of ~18%. We looked for the timing\nsignature of Calvera in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) database and found\na significant (~5 sigma) pulsed signal at a period coincident with the X-ray\nvalue. The gamma-ray timing analysis yielded a tight upper limit on the period\nderivative, dP/dt < 5E-18 s/s (dE_rot/dt <1E33 erg/s, B<5E10 G for magneto-\ndipolar spin-down). Radio searches at 1.36 GHz with the 100-m Effelsberg radio\ntelescope yielded negative results, with a deep upper limit on the pulsed flux\nof 0.05 mJy. Diffuse, soft (< 1 keV) X-ray emission about 13' west of the\nCalvera position is present both in our pointed observations and in archive\nROSAT all-sky survey images, but is unlikely associated with the X-ray pulsar.\nIts spectrum is compatible with an old supernova remnant (SNR); no evidence for\ndiffuse emission in the radio and optical bands was found. The most likely\ninterpretations are that Calvera is either a central compact object escaped\nfrom a SNR or a mildly recycled pulsar; in both cases the source would be the\nfirst ever member of the class detected at gamma-ray energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2010 15:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
