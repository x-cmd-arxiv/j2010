Aims: We almost double the number of\nVLBI-imaged quasars at these high redshifts with the aim of studying their\nredshift-dependent structural and physical properties in a larger sample.\nMethods: We observed five radio quasars (J0813+3508, J1146+4037, J1242+5422,\nJ1611+0844, and J1659+2101) at 4.5<z<5 with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at\n1.6 GHz on 29 October 2008 and at 5 GHz on 22 October 2008. The angular\nresolution achieved ranges from 1.5 to 25 milli-arcseconds (mas), depending on\nthe observing frequency, the position angle in the sky, and the source's\ncelestial position. Results: The sources are all somewhat extended on mas\nscales, but compact enough to be detected at both frequencies. With one\nexception of a flat-spectrum source (J1611+0844), their compact emission is\ncharacterised by a steep radio spectrum. We found no evidence of\nDoppler-boosted radio emission in the quasars in our sample. The radio\nstructure of one of them (J0813+3508) is extended to ~7\", which corresponds to\n43 kpc projected linear size. Many of the highest redshift compact radio\nsources are likely to be young, evolving objects, far-away cousins of the\npowerful gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and compact steep-spectrum (CSS)\nsources that populate the Universe at lower redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2010 16:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

Our main result is the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the\ncategory of reduced operads of spectra (with the projective model structure)\nand a new model for the homotopy theory of cooperads of spectra. The crucial\nconstruction is of a weak equivalence of operads between the Boardman-Vogt\nW-construction for an operad P, and the cobar-bar construction on P. This weak\nequivalence generalizes a theorem of Berger and Moerdijk that says the W- and\ncobar-bar constructions are isomorphic for operads of chain complexes. Our\nmodel for the homotopy theory of cooperads is based on `pre-cooperads'. These\ncan be viewed as cooperads in which the structure maps are zigzags of maps of\nspectra that satisfy coherence conditions. Our model structure on pre-cooperads\nis such that every object is weakly equivalent to an actual cooperad, and weak\nequivalences between cooperads are detected in the underlying symmetric\nsequences.

The BLRs in AGNs are believed to be\nassociated with the outflows from the accretion disks. Most of the\nlow-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) contain advection dominated accretion flows\n(ADAFs), which are very hot and have a positive Bernoulli parameter. ADAFs are\ntherefore associated with strong outflows. We estimate the cooling of the\noutflows from the ADAFs, and find that the gases in such hot outflows always\ncannot be cooled efficiently by bremsstrahlung radiation. The ADAF may co-exist\nwith the standard disk, i.e., the inner ADAF connects to the outer thin\naccretion disk at radius R_tr, in the sources accreting at slightly lower than\nthe critical rate. For the ADAFs with >0.001 L_edd, a secondary small inner\ncold disk is suggested to co-exist with the ADAF due to the condensation\nprocess. We estimate the Compton cooling of the outflow, of which the soft seed\nphotons either come from the outer cold disk or the secondary inner cold disk.\nIt is found that the gas in the outflow far from the ADAF may be efficiently\ncooled to form BLR clouds due to the soft seed photons emitted from the cold\ndisks, provided the transition radius of the ADAF to the outer cold disk is\nsmall or/and the secondary small cold disk has a luminosity >0.003L_edd. The\nBLR clouds can still be formed in the outflows from the outer cold thin disks,\nif the transition radius is not very large. For the sources with <0.001L_edd,\nthe inner small cold disk is evaporated completely in the ADAF and outer thin\naccretion disk may be suppressed by the ADAF, which leads to the disappearance\nof the BLR. The physical implications of this scenario on the double-peaked\nbroad-line emitters are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2010 01:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this study we focus on understanding the\nmatter clustering at several redshifts. The primordial non-Gaussianity is\nmodeled as a quadratic correction to the local Gaussian potential, and is\ncharacterized by the parameter f_NL. In our formulation of the halo model we\npay special attention to the effect of halo exclusion, and show that this can\npotentially solve the long standing problem of excess power on large scales in\nthis model. The model depends on the mass function, clustering and density\nprofiles of halos. We test these ingredients using a large ensemble of\nhigh-resolution Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations. In particular,\nwe provide a first exploration of how density profiles change in the presence\nof primordial non-Gaussianities. We find that for f_NL positive/negative high\nmass halos have an increased/decreased core density, so being more/less\nconcentrated than in the Gaussian case. We also examine the halo bias and show\nthat, if the halo model is correct, then there is a small asymmetry in the\nscale-dependence of the bias on very large scales, which arises because the\nGaussian bias must be renormalized. We show that the matter power spectrum is\nmodified by ~2.5% and ~3.5% on scales k~1.0 h/Mpc at z=0 and z=1, respectively.\nOur halo model calculation reproduces the absolute amplitude to within 10% and\nthe ratio of non-Gaussian to Gaussian spectra to within 1%.

In this work, we report other\nconsequences of mutation accumulation. Contrary to earlier findings, such\ndramatic manifestation of aging depends not only on the choice of breeding\nstrategy but also on the value of the reproduction age, R, and the mutation\nthreshold, T. Senescence is catastrophic when $T \\leq R$. As the organism's\ntolerance for harmful genetic mutations increases, the aging process becomes\nmore gradual. We observe senescence that is threshold dependent whenever T>R.\nThat is, the sudden drop in survival rate occurs at age equal to the mutation\nthreshold value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2010 14:10:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2010 02:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

If the Dirac fermions have a small bare mass, an\napproximate continuous chiral symmetry is dynamically broken and the resultant\nGoldstone type excitons become massive, which is analogous to what happens in\nQCD. In this paper, after solving Dyson-Schwinger gap equation in the presence\nof a small bare fermion mass, we found a remarkable reduction of the critical\nCoulomb interaction strength for excitonic pair formation and a strong\nenhancement of dynamical fermion mass.

In this quantization the fundamental excitations are called spin\nnetwork states, and in the context of general relativity, they give a meaning\nto quantum geometry. Spin foams are a sort of path integral for spin network\nstates, supposed to enable the computations of transition amplitudes between\nthese states. The spin foam quantization has proved very efficient for\ntopological field theories, like 2d Yang-Mills, 3d gravity or BF theories.\nDifferent models have also been proposed for 4-dimensional quantum gravity. In\nthis PhD manuscript, I discuss several methods to study spin foam models. In\nparticular, I present some recurrence relations on spin foam amplitudes, which\ngenerically encode classical symmetries at the quantum level, and are likely to\nhelp fill the gap with the Hamiltonian constraints. These relations can be\nnaturally interpreted in terms of elementary deformations of discrete geometric\nstructures, like simplicial geometries. Another interesting method consists in\nexploring the way spin foam models can be written as path integrals for systems\nof geometries on a lattice, taking inspiration from topological models and\nRegge calculus. This leads to a very geometric view on spin foams, and gives\nclassical action principles which are studied in details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2010 15:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-28"}
