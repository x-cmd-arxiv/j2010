The resulting\nradiative cooling by HD can lower the gas temperature to that of the cosmic\nmicrowave background, T_CMB=2.7(1+z)K, significantly below the temperature of a\nfew 100 K achievable via H_2-cooling alone, and thus reduce the masses of the\nfirst generation of stars. Here we consider the suppression of HD-cooling by UV\nirradiation in the Lyman-Werner (LW) bands. We include photo-dissociation of\nboth H_2 and HD, and explicitly compute the self-shielding and shielding of\nboth molecules by neutral hydrogen as well as the shielding of HD by H_2. We\nuse a simplified dynamical collapse model, and follow the chemical and thermal\nevolution of the gas, in the presence of a UV background. We find that a LW\nflux of J_crit = 1e-22 erg/cm^2/sr/s/Hz is able to suppress HD cooling and thus\nprevent collapsing primordial gas from reaching temperatures below 100 K. The\nmain reason for the lack of HD cooling for J>J_crit is the partial\nphoto-dissociation of H_2, which prevents the gas from reaching sufficiently\nlow temperatures (T<150K) for HD to become the dominant coolant; direct HD\nphoto-dissociation is unimportant except for a narrow range of fluxes and\ncolumn densities. Since the prevention of HD-cooling requires only partial H_2\nphoto-dissociation, the critical flux J_crit is modest, and is below the UV\nbackground required to reionize the universe at redshift z=10-20. We conclude\nthat HD-cooling can reduce the masses of typical stars only in rare halos\nforming well before the epoch of reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 16:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\ngoals of this study are to evaluate whether short GRBs track the stellar mass\ndistribution of galaxies, to investigate the progenitor delay time\ndistribution, and to explore any connection between long and short GRB\nprogenitors. Using single stellar population models we infer masses of\nlog(M/M_sun)=8.8-11.6 and population ages of tau=0.03-4.4 Gyr. We further infer\nmaximal masses of log(M/M_sun)=9.7-11.9 by assuming stellar population ages\nequal to the age of the universe at each host's redshift. Comparing the\ndistribution of stellar masses to the general galaxy mass function we find that\nshort GRBs track the cosmic stellar mass distribution only if the late-type\nhosts generally have maximal masses. However, there is an apparent dearth of\nearly-type hosts compared to the equal contribution of early- and late-type\ngalaxies to the cosmic stellar mass budget. These results suggest that stellar\nmass may not be the sole parameter controlling the short GRB rate, and raise\nthe possibility of a two-component model with both mass and star formation\nplaying a role. If short GRBs in late-type galaxies indeed track the star\nformation activity, the resulting typical delay time is ~0.2 Gyr, while those\nin early-type hosts have a typical delay of ~3 Gyr.

The infalling gas velocity around minihalos/dwarf galaxies strongly\naffects the line shape, and with the low spin temperatures outside the virial\nradii of the systems, gives rise to horn-like line profiles. The optical depth\nof a dwarf galaxy is reduced for lines of sight penetrating through its HII\nregion, and especially, a large HII region created by a dwarf galaxy with\nhigher stellar mass and/or a top-heavy initial mass function results in an\noptical depth trough rather than an absorption line. We compute synthetic\nspectra of 21 cm forest for both high redshift quasars and radio afterglows of\ngamma ray bursts (GRBs). Even with the planned SKA, radio afterglows of most if\nnot all GRBs would still be too dim to be the background sources for high\nresolution (1 kHz) observations, but absorption lines can be easily detected\ntowards a high-z quasar. Broadband observation against GRB afterglows can also\nbe used to reveal the evolving 21 cm signal from both minihalos and dwarf\ngalaxies if there was no X-ray background or it was extremely weak, but it\nbecomes difficult if an early X-ray background existed. Hence the 21 cm\nabsorption could be a powerful probe of the presence/intensity of the X-ray\nbackground and the thermal history of the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 20:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-01"}

We find the global fraction of\nmorphological types of galaxies to be consistent with results in the\nliterature. Interestingly, we find that the fraction of S0s also correlates\nwith local galaxy density, in contrast to the findings of a study of the cores\nof 10 clusters at similar redshift by Dressler et al. We suggest that this\napparent inconsistency is due to differences in the spatial coverage around\nclusters, which is supported by the fact that the correlation disappears for\nS0s within a radius of 0.6R_200 of MACSJ0717. We interpret this result as\nevidence of the morphology-density relation being caused by a combination of\nmorphological transformation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions, and\neffects related to the formation and evolution of large-scale structure. In\nenvironments of low to intermediate density, where galaxy-galaxy interactions\nare frequent and efficient, the observed pronounced morphology-density relation\nfor S0s reflects the density dependence of the interaction cross section. In\nclusters, however, the correlation disappears for S0s, as the much higher\ngalaxy velocities in clusters not only lower the interaction cross section, but\nalso cause a spatial redistribution of galaxies that all but destroys such a\ncorrelation. This argument does not hold for elliptical galaxies in clusters\nwhich, having formed much earlier, have settled into the large-scale cluster\npotential; hence the morphology-density relation for cluster ellipticals may\nreflect primarily the state of advanced dynamical relaxation of this population\nwithin the cluster rather than a causal link to the environment responsible for\nthe morphological transformation of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 20:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We identified these stars (Valeev et al. 2010) as massive star\ncandidates at the final stages of evolution, presumably with a notable\ninterstellar extinction. The candidates were selected from the Massey et al.\n(2006) catalog based on the following criteria: emission in Halpha, V<18.5 and\n0.35<(B-V)<1.2. The spectra of both stars reveal a broad and strong Halpha\nemission with extended wings (770 and 1000 km/s). Based on the spectra we\nestimated the main parameters of the stars. Object N45901 has a bolometric\nluminosity log(L/Lsun)=6.0-6.2 with the value of interstellar extinction\nAv=2.3+-0.1. The temperature of the star's photosphere is estimated as\nTstar~13000-15000K its probable mass on the Zero Age Main Sequence is\nM~60-80Msun. The infrared excess in N45901 corresponds to the emission of warm\ndust with the temperature Twarm~1000K, and amounts to 0.1% of the bolometric\nluminosity. A comparison of stellar magnitude estimates from different catalogs\npoints to the probable variability of the object N45901. Bolometric luminosity\nof the second object, N125093, is log(L/Lsun)=6.3-6.6, the value of\ninterstellar extinction is Av=2.75+-0.15. We estimate its photosphere's\ntemperature as Tstar~13000-16000K, the initial mass as M~90-120Msun. The\ninfrared excess in N125093 amounts to 5-6% of the bolometric luminosity. Its\nspectral energy distribution reveals two thermal components with the\ntemperatures Twarm~1000K and Tcold~480K. The [CaII] lines (7291A and 7323A),\nobserved in LBV-like stars VarA and N93351 in M33, are also present in the\nspectrum of N125093. These lines indicate relatively recent gas eruptions and\ndust activity linked with them. High bolometric luminosity of these stars and\nbroad Halpha emissions allow classifying the studied objects as LBV candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2010 21:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We derive powerful new upper and lower\nbounds on $Z(G,q,s,v,w)$ for the ferromagnetic case in terms of zero-field\nPotts partition functions with certain transformed arguments. We also prove\ngeneral inequalities for $Z(G,q,s,v,w)$ on different families of tree graphs.\nAs part of our analysis, we elucidate how the field-dependent Potts partition\nfunction and weighted-set chromatic polynomial distinguish, respectively,\nbetween Tutte-equivalent and chromatically equivalent pairs of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 00:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-25"}

Based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improve\nthe rate of both users at the same time using a relay node in an interference\nchannel. In this strategy, the relay observes a linear combination of the two\nsource signals, and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations over a\nshared out-of-band link of rate R0 bits per channel use. The relay message\nconsists of the bin index of a structured binning scheme obtained from a\n2^R0-way partition of the squared lattice in the complex plane. We show that\nsuch scalar quantization-binning relay strategy asymptotically achieves the\ncut-set bound in an interference channel with a common out-of-band relay link\nof limited rate, improving the sum rate by two bits for every bit relayed,\nasymptotically at high signal to noise ratios (SNR) and when interference is\ntreated as noise.

We consider matched and mismatched scenarios, depending on\nwhether the input alphabet of the interference signal is known or unknown to\nthe decoder, respectively. For the matched scenario, we show the proposed\nstrategy results in significant gains in SNR. For the mismatched scenario, we\nshow that the proposed strategy results in rate improvements that, without the\nrelay, cannot be achieved by merely increasing transmit powers.

We analyse in unprecedented detail the deceleration of\na self-similar Blandford-McKee blast wave from a Lorentz factor 25 to the\nnonrelativistic Sedov phase. Our goal is to determine the stability properties\nof its frontal shock. We carried out a grid-adaptive relativistic 2D\nhydro-simulation at extreme resolving power, following the GRB jet during the\nentire afterglow phase. We investigate the effect of the finite initial jet\nopening angle on the deceleration of the blast wave, and identify the growth of\nvarious instabilities throughout the coasting shock front. We find that during\nthe relativistic phase, the blast wave is subject to pressure-ram pressure\ninstabilities that ripple and fragment the frontal shock. These instabilities\nmanifest themselves in the ultra-relativistic phase alone, remain in full\nagreement with causality arguments, and decay slowly to finally disappear in\nthe near-Newtonian phase as the shell Lorentz factor drops below 3. From then\non, the compression rate decreases to levels predicted to be stable by a linear\nanalysis of the Sedov phase. Our simulations confirm previous findings that the\nshell also spreads laterally because a rarefaction wave slowly propagates to\nthe jet axis, inducing a clear shell deformation from its initial spherical\nshape. The blast front becomes meridionally stratified, with decreasing speed\nfrom axis to jet edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 08:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Despite their apparent noisy\norigin, fluctuations encode fundamental aspects of the physics of the system at\nhand, crucial to understand irreversibility and nonequilibrium behavior. In\norder to sustain a given fluctuation, a system traverses a precise optimal path\nin phase space. Here we show that by demanding invariance of optimal paths\nunder symmetry transformations, new and general fluctuation relations valid\narbitrarily far from equilibrium are unveiled. This opens an unexplored route\ntoward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing symmetry\nprinciples to the realm of fluctuations. We illustrate this concept studying\nsymmetries of the current distribution out of equilibrium. In particular we\nderive an isometric fluctuation relation which links in a strikingly simple\nmanner the probabilities of any pair of isometric current fluctuations. This\nrelation, which results from the time-reversibility of the dynamics, includes\nas a particular instance the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem in this\ncontext but adds a completely new perspective on the high level of symmetry\nimposed by time-reversibility on the statistics of nonequilibrium fluctuations.\nThe new symmetry implies remarkable hierarchies of equations for the current\ncumulants and the nonlinear response coefficients, going far beyond Onsager's\nreciprocity relations and Green-Kubo formulae.

In particular the large elliptic flow and the nearly\nequal $\\Rapt$ of quarks and gluons can be accounted for only if the energy loss\noccurs mainly around $T_c$ and the $q\\leftrightarrow g$ conversion is\nsignificant. The use of an equation of state fitted to lattice QCD\ncalculations, slowing down the cooling as $T \\to T_c$, seems to contribute to\nboth the enhancement of $v_2$ and the efficiency of the conversion mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 12:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-08"}

The formation of Langmuir solitons through the coupling of\nhigh-frequency (hf) Langmuir and low-frequency (lf) ion-acoustic waves, is one\nof the most interesting features in the context of turbulence in modern plasma\nphysics. Moreover, quantum plasmas, which are ubiquitous in ultrasmall\nelectronic devices, micromechanical systems as well as in dense astrophysical\nenvironments are a topic of current research. In the light of notable interests\nin such quantum plasmas, we present here a theoretical investigation on the\nnonlinear interaction of quantum Langmuir waves (QLWs) and quantum ion-acoustic\nwaves (QIAWs), which are governed by the one-dimensional quantum Zakharov\nequations (QZEs). It is shown that a transition to spatiotemporal chaos (STC)\noccurs when the length scale of excitation of linear modes is larger than that\nof the most unstable ones. Such length scale is, however, to be larger\n(compared to the classical one) in presence of the quantum tunneling effect.\nThe latter induces strong QIAW emission leading to the occurrence of collision\nand fusion among the patterns at an earlier time than the classical case.\nMoreover, numerical simulation of the QZEs reveals that many solitary patterns\ncan be excited and saturated through the modulational instability (MI) of\nunstable harmonic modes. In a longer time, these solitons are seen to appear in\nthe state of STC due to strong QIAW emission as well as by the collision and\nfusion in stochastic motion. The energy in the system is thus strongly\nredistributed, which may switch on the onset of Langmuir turbulence in quantum\nplasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 14:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-16"}

However, we show that general quantum decoding problem\nis NP-hard regardless of the quantum codes being degenerate or non-degenerate.\nThis finding implies that no considerably fast decoding algorithm exists for\nthe general quantum decoding problems, and suggests the existence of a quantum\ncryptosystem based on the hardness of decoding QECCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 15:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 12:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}
