Also a discrepancy of about five\nstandard deviations in the value of the proton charge radius recently obtained\nfrom muonic hydrogen versus that previously obtained from electronic hydrogen\ncasts doubt on the calculation of the dominant relativistic QED contributions\nto the effects that are actually measured (e.g., the Lamb shift): these QED\ncontributions dominate proton charge radius contributions less in muonic\nhydrogen than in electronic hydrogen. The negative-energy \"free particles\" of\nentrenched relativistic quantum theory are well-known features of the\nKlein-Gordon and Dirac equations, which are shown to have many other unphysical\nfeatures as well. The correspondence principle for relativistic particles is\nincompatible with these two equations, produces no unphysical features and\nimplies only positive energies for free particles, which eliminates the very\nbasis of the entrenched notion of antiparticles, as well as of the CPT theorem.\nThis principle thus requires antiparticles to arise from charge conjugation (or\nmore generally CP) invariance, whose known breaking is naturally expected to\nproduce mass splitting between particle and antiparticle, in consonance with\nthe preliminary MINOS data.

In particular, they argue that instances in practice\nshould be stable to small perturbations in the metric space and give an\nefficient algorithm for clustering instances of the Max-Cut problem that are\nstable to perturbations of size $O(n^{1/2})$. In addition, they conjecture that\ninstances stable to as little as O(1) perturbations should be solvable in\npolynomial time.

In our model, QPO oscillations are due to the\noscillations of the shock formed in the low angular momentum hot accretion\nflow, and the variation of the shock location corresponds to the observed\nchanges in the QPO period and the X-ray flux. In this scenario, change in the\nshock location caused by perturbation of the flow angular momentum is\ncompatible with the trends observed in RE J1034+396, whereas the perturbation\nof the specific flow energy results in too strong flux response to the change\nof the oscillation period.

The non-linear decomposition technique called Geometric Mean\nDecomposition (GMD) is employed for the formation of eigenmodes over MIMO\nflatfading channel. Exploiting GMD technique, identical, parallel and\nindependent transmission pipes are created for data transmission at higher\nrate. The system based on such decomposition technique is referred to as MIMO\nIdentical Eigenmode Transmission System (IETS). The comparative analysis of the\nMIMO transceiver design exploiting nonlinear and linear decomposition\ntechniques for variable constellation is presented in this paper. The new\ntransmission strategy is tested in combination with the Vertical Bell Labs\nLayered Space Time (V-BLAST) decoding scheme using different number of antennas\non both sides of the communication link. The analysis is supported by various\nsimulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2010 14:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

Due to the\nlarge potential barriers for photoexited charge carriers, transport in these\ndevices is restricted to quantum confined superlattice states. As a consequence\nof the finite number of wells, large built-in fields and any kind of disorder,\nthe electronic spectrum can deviate considerably from the minibands of a\nregular superlattice. In this paper, a quantum-kinetic theory based on the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism for an effective mass Hamiltonian is\nused to investigate photogeneration and transport in such devices for arbitrary\ngeometry and operating conditions. By including the coupling of electrons to\nboth photons and phonons, the theory is able to provide a microscopic picture\nof indirect generation, carrier relaxation and inter-well transport mechanisms\nbeyond the ballistic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2010 15:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

Such an instrument could provide an excellent ground-based\ncomplement for the Gaia mission and a northern complement to the HERMES project\non the AAT. The CFHT is well known for providing a stable prime focus\nenvironment, with a large field of view, which has hosted several imaging\ninstruments, but has never hosted a multifibre spectrograph. Building upon the\nexperience gained at GEPI with FLAMES-Giraffe and X-Shooter, we are\ninvestigating the feasibility of a high multiplex spectrograph (about 500\nfibres) over a field of view 1 degree in diameter. We are investigating an\ninstrument with resolution in the range 15000 to 30000, which should provide\naccurate chemical abundances for stars down to 16th magnitude and radial\nvelocities, accurate to 1 km/s for fainter stars. The study is led by\nGEPI-Observatoire de Paris with a contribution from Oxford for the study of the\npositioner. The financing for the study comes from INSU CSAA and Observatoire\nde Paris.
