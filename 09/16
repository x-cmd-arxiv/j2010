The maximum charge gain\nachieved in each pressure is approximately constant, around 4x10^2, for xenon\npressures up to 5 bar and decreasing slowly above this pressure down to values\nsomewhat above 10^2 at 10 bar. The MM presents the highest gains for xenon\npressures above 4 bar, when compared to other micropattern gaseous multipliers.\nThe lowest energy resolution obtained for X-rays of 22.1 keV exhibits a steady\nincrease with pressure, from 12% at 1bar to about 32% at 10 bar. The effective\nscintillation yield, defined as the number of photons exiting through the MM\nmesh holes per primary electron produced in the conversion region was\ncalculated. This yield is about 2x10^2 photons per primary electron at 1 bar,\nincreasing to about 6x10^2 at 5 bar and, then, decreasing again to 2x10^2 at 10\nbar.

The\nphotometric behavior of M31-RV (and several other very red novae, i.e. luminous\neruptive red variables) has led to several models of this apparently new class\nof astrophysical object. One of the most detailed models is that of\n\"mergebursts\": hypothetical mergers of close binary stars. These are predicted\nto rival or exceed the brightest classical novae in luminosity, but to be much\ncooler and redder than classical novae, and to become slowly hotter and bluer\nas they age. This prediction suggests two stringent and definitive tests of the\nmergeburst hypothesis. First, there should always be a cool red remnant, and\nNOT a hot blue remnant at the site of such an outburst. Second, the inflated\nenvelope of a mergeburst event should be slowly contracting, hence it must\ndisplay a slowly rising effective temperature. We have located a luminous,\nUV-bright object within 0.4 arcsec (1.5 sigma of the astrometric position) of\nM31-RV in archival WFPC2 images taken 10 years after the outburst: it resembles\nan old nova. Twenty years after the outburst, the object remains much too hot\nto be a mergeburst. Its behavior remains consistent with that of theoretical\nnova models which erupt on a low mass white dwarf. Future Hubble UV and visible\nimages could determine if the M31-RV analogs (in M85 and in M99) are also\nbehaving like old novae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 16:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In 2-plectic geometry we meet higher analogues of many structures\nfamiliar from symplectic geometry. For example, any 2-plectic manifold has a\nLie 2-algebra consisting of smooth functions and Hamiltonian 1-forms. This is\nequipped with a Poisson-like bracket which only satisfies the Jacobi identity\nup to `coherent chain homotopy'. Over any 2-plectic manifold is a vector bundle\nequipped with extra structure called an exact Courant algebroid. This Courant\nalgebroid is the 2-plectic analogue of a transitive Lie algebroid over a\nsymplectic manifold. Its space of global sections also forms a Lie 2-algebra.\nWe show that this Lie 2-algebra contains an important sub-Lie 2-algebra which\nis isomorphic to the Lie 2-algebra of Hamiltonian 1-forms. Furthermore, we\nprove that it is quasi-isomorphic to a central extension of the (trivial) Lie\n2-algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields, and therefore is the higher analogue of\nthe well-known Kostant-Souriau central extension in symplectic geometry.

We employ a uniform set of infrared extinction maps to\nprovide accurate assessments of cloud mass and structure and compare these with\ninventories of young stellar objects within the clouds. We present evidence\nindicating that both the yield and rate of star formation can vary considerably\nin local clouds, independent of their mass and size. We find that the surface\ndensity structure of such clouds appears to be important in controlling both\nthese factors. In particular, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) in\nmolecular clouds is linearly proportional to the cloud mass (M_{0.8}) above an\nextinction threshold of A_K approximately equal to 0.8 magnitudes,\ncorresponding to a gas surface density threshold of approximaely 116 solar\nmasses per square pc. We argue that this surface density threshold corresponds\nto a gas volume density threshold which we estimate to be n(H_2) approximately\nequal to 10^4\\cc. Specifically we find SFR (solar masses per yr) = 4.6 +/- 2.6\nx 10^{-8} M_{0.8} (solar masses) for the clouds in our sample. This relation\nbetween the rate of star formation and the amount of dense gas in molecular\nclouds appears to be in excellent agreement with previous observations of both\ngalactic and extragalactic star forming activity. It is likely the underlying\nphysical relationship or empirical law that most directly connects star\nformation activity with interstellar gas over many spatial scales within and\nbetween individual galaxies. These results suggest that the key to obtaining a\npredictive understanding of the star formation rates in molecular clouds and\ngalaxies is to understand those physical factors which give rise to the dense\ncomponents of these clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 18:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The violation of the Bell-type inequalities was considered as\nproving this non-locality. However, these inequalities are constructed on a\nclass of local hidden variables, which obey the calculus with positive\nprobabilities. Such a calculus is rather suitable for billiard balls while the\nQM deals with wave-packets of complex amplitudes. There is no wonder that a\ncalculus with positive numbers does not match a calculus with complex numbers.\nThe present text describes a different model of hidden variables for\nentanglements, model that reproduces the quantum predictions in different\nexperiments, and also explains why the QM is nonlocal. The model deals with\nwaves, some of them full and the others empty, and the hidden variables mark\nwhich waves are full. The basic physical concept with which the model operates\nis joint amplitudes of probability, and not probabilities. The latter are a\nsecondary concept, the probability of a combination of results being equal to\nthe absolute square of sum of all the contributing joint amplitudes. Thus the\nnon-locality appears: a) a joint amplitude ignores distance, it handles distant\nparticles as if they were one single particle at one single place, b) joint\namplitudes are complex numbers and the sum of several contributions may vanish,\nblocking the respective combination of wave-packets and therefore of results.\nAlthough showing the success of the model, this text does not advocate for\nfull/empty waves. It is shown that this hypothesis works only as long as one\ndoes not consider moving observers, and does not compare their conclusions. The\nreal purpose here is to point to a severe impasse: assuming the existence of a\npreferred frame contradicts the theory of relativity, while refuting the\nfull/empty waves idea one runs into other insurmountable difficulties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 18:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 00:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

Then, we consider sensors with overlapping\nsensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the\ndifferent sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein\nthe target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous\nspaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models\ndue to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces.

We detect 16 and 5 objects belonging to HCG\n22 and HCG 90, respectively, covering the magnitude range -10.0 > M_R > -11.5\nmag. Their colours are consistent with old ages covering a broad range in\nmetallicities.

We are able to consistently describe the distribution of\nextrasolar planetary systems in terms of period, eccentricity and mass (with a\nlower limit of a Saturn mass) with this simple model. Our model is consistent\nwith the survival of short-period exoplanet systems, but not with the\ncircularisation period of equal mass stellar binaries, suggesting that the\nlatter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host\nstars. Our model is also not consistent with the explanation of inflated\nplanetary radii as resulting from tidal dissipation.

This\npaper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation,\nscaling and translation of the image.

This is\nachieved by the definition of a \"saliency graph\" connecting these points\njointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash\nis then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the\neigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph, that is, its graph Fourier transform.\nInterestingly, this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph\nnodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image, making the hash\nrobust to image transformation, yet distinct for different visual content.

The giant exoplanets are cloud-free at\n0.8 AU, have H2O clouds at 2 AU, and have both NH3 and H2O clouds at 5 AU and\n10 AU. For each model planet we compute moderate resolution spectra as a\nfunction of phase. The presence and structure of clouds strongly influence the\nspectra. Since the planet images will be unresolved, their phase may not be\nobvious, and multiple observations will be needed to discriminate between the\neffects of planet-star separation, metallicity, and phase.

To begin, we carry out a quantum analysis of a dc\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mechanical displacement\ndetector comprised of a SQUID with a mechanically compliant loop segment. The\nSQUID is approximated by a nonlinear current-dependent inductor, inducing a\nflux tunable nonlinear Duffing term in the cavity equation of motion.\nExpressions are derived for the detector signal and noise response where it is\nfound that a soft-spring Duffing self-interaction enables a closer approach to\nthe displacement detection standard quantum limit, as well as cooling closer to\nthe ground state. Next, we make use of a superconducting transmission line\nformed from an array of dc-SQUIDs for investigating analogue Hawking radiation.\nBiasing the array with a space-time varying flux modifies the propagation\nvelocity of the transmission line, leading to an effective metric with a\nhorizon. This setup allows for quantum effects such as backreaction and\nanalogue space-time fluctuations on the Hawking process. Finally, we look at a\nquantum parametric amplifier with dynamical pump mode, viewed as a\nzero-dimensional model of Hawking radiation from an evaporating black hole. The\nconditions are derived under which the spectrum of particles generated from\nvacuum fluctuations deviates from the thermal spectrum predicted for the\nconventional parametric amplifier. We find that significant deviation occurs\nonce the pump mode (black hole) has released nearly half of its initial energy\nin the signal (Hawking radiation) and idler (in-falling particle) modes.

Single molecule (singlet) and correlated density\norientational profiles and singlet and collective reorientational dynamics are\nreported for both interfaces. At the LS interface acetonitrile forms layers.\nThe closest sublayer is dominated by nitrogen atoms bonding to the hydrogen\nsites of the silica surface. The singlet molecular reorientation is strongly\nhindered when close to the silica surface, but at the LV interface it relaxes\nmuch faster than in the bulk. Antiparallel correlations between acetonitrile\nmolecules at the LV interface are even stronger than in the bulk liquid phase.\nThis strong antiparallel correlation disappears at the LS interface. The\ncollective reorientational relaxation of the first layer acetonitrile is much\nfaster than the singlet reorientational relaxation but it is still slower than\nin the bulk.

In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective. The frozen zone together with global\ndust transport might explain \"slow\" (\\sim 10^6 yr) dust evolution suggested by\ninfrared observation of T Tauri stars and by radioactive dating of chondrites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 06:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 12:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The predictions of the ellipticity of the dark matter halos from models\nof structure formation are notoriously difficult to test with observations. A\ndirect measurement would give important constraints on the formation of\ngalaxies, and its effect on the dark matter distribution in their halos. Here\nwe show that galaxy-galaxy flexion provides a direct and potentially powerful\nmethod for determining the ellipticity of (an ensemble of) elliptical lenses.\nMethods. We decompose the spin-1 flexion into a radial and a tangential\ncomponent. Using the ratio of tangential-to- radial flexion, which is\nindependent of the radial mass profile, the mass ellipticity can be estimated.\nResults. An estimator for the ellipticity of the mass distribution is derived\nand tested with simulations. We show that the estimator is slightly biased. We\nquantify this bias, and provide a method to reduce it. Furthermore, a\nparametric fitting of the flexion ratio and orientation provides another\nestimate for the dark halo ellipticity, which is more accurate for individual\nlenses Overall, galaxy-galaxy flexion appears as a powerful tool for\nconstraining the ellipticity of mass distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 09:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nfact that the outbursting star is in the middle of an old planetary nebula and\nthat the ejecta associated with the outburst is hydrogen deficient supports\nthis diagnosis. However, the material ejected during that outburst is also\nextremely neon rich, suggesting that it derives from an oxygen-neon-magnesium\nstar, as is the case in the so-called neon novae. We have therefore attempted\nto construct a scenario that explains all the observations of the nebula and\nits central star, including the ejecta abundances. We find two scenarios that\nhave the potential to explain the observations, although neither is a perfect\nmatch. The first scenario invokes the merger of a main sequence star and a\nmassive oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf. The second invokes an\noxygen-neon-magnesium classical nova that takes place shortly after a final\nhelium shell flash. The main drawback of the first scenario is the inability to\ndetermine whether the ejecta would have the observed composition and whether a\nmerger could result in the observed hydrogen-deficient stellar abundances\nobserved in the star today. The second scenario is based on better understood\nphysics, but, through a population synthesis technique, we determine that its\nfrequency of occurrence should be very low and possibly lower than what is\nimplied by the number of observed systems. While we could not envisage a\nscenario that naturally explains this object, this is the second final flash\nstar which, upon closer scrutiny, is found to have hydrogen-deficient ejecta\nwith abnormally high neon abundances.

However, it has been shown that scalar quantization of\noversampled or Compressively Sensed signals can be inefficient in terms of the\nrate-distortion trade-off, especially as the oversampling rate or the sparsity\nof the signal increases. In this paper, we modify the scalar quantizer to have\ndiscontinuous quantization regions. We demonstrate that with this modification\nit is possible to achieve exponential decay of the quantization error as a\nfunction of the oversampling rate instead of the quadratic decay exhibited by\ncurrent approaches. Our approach is universal in the sense that prior knowledge\nof the signal model is not necessary in the quantizer design, only in the\nreconstruction. Thus, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the\nquantization error by incorporating side information on the acquired signal,\nsuch as sparse signal models or signal similarity with known signals. In doing\nso, we establish a relationship between quantization performance and the\nKolmogorov entropy of the signal model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 11:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 17:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 23:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

Establishing a connection between\nthe scattering approach employed here and earlier work that employs the\nquasiclassical formalism, we connect the symmetry properties of the Andreev\nreflection amplitudes to the symmetry properties of the anomalous Green\nfunction in the half metal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 12:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It\ninvolves grouping subsets of items into different pools and detecting defective\nmembers based on the set of test results obtained for each pool.\n  In a classical noiseless group testing setup, it is assumed that the sampling\nprocedure is fully known to the reconstruction algorithm, in the sense that the\nexistence of a defective member in a pool results in the test outcome of that\npool to be positive. However, this may not be always a valid assumption in some\ncases of interest. In particular, we consider the case where the defective\nitems in a pool can become independently inactive with a certain probability.\nHence, one may obtain a negative test result in a pool despite containing some\ndefective items. As a result, any sampling and reconstruction method should be\nable to cope with two different types of uncertainty, i.e., the unknown set of\ndefective items and the partially unknown, probabilistic testing procedure.\n  In this work, motivated by the application of detecting infected people in\nviral epidemics, we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow\nsuccessful identification of the defective items through a set of probabilistic\ntests. Our design requires only a small number of tests to single out the\ndefective items. In particular, for a population of size $N$ and at most $K$\ndefective items with activation probability $p$, our results show that $M =\nO(K^2\\log{(N/K)}/p^3)$ tests is sufficient if the sampling procedure should\nwork for all possible sets of defective items, while $M = O(K\\log{(N)}/p^3)$\ntests is enough to be successful for any single set of defective items.\nMoreover, we show that the defective members can be recovered using a simple\nreconstruction algorithm with complexity of $O(MN)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 14:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 20:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Galaxy environments are measured in terms of nearest\nneighbour densities as well as fixed aperture densities and kinematical and\ndynamical parameters of neighbour galaxies within a radius of 1 Mpc. We\ndisentangle the correlations between galaxy stellar mass, galaxy colour and\ngalaxy environment, using not only galaxy number densities, but also other\nenvironmental characteristics such as velocity dispersion, mean harmonic\nradius, and crossing time. We find that galaxy colour and the fraction of blue\ngalaxies depends very strongly on stellar mass at 0.4 < z < 1, while a weak\nadditional dependence on local number densities is in place at lower redshifts\n(0.4 < z < 0.7). This environmental influence is most visible in the colours of\nintermediate mass galaxies (10.5 < log M* < 11), whereas colours of lower and\nhigher mass galaxies remain largely unchanged with redshift and environment. At\na fixed stellar mass, the colour-density relation almost disappears, while the\ncolour-stellar mass relation is present at all local densities. We find a weak\ncorrelation between stellar mass and environment at intermediate redshifts,\nwhich contributes to the overall colour-density relation. We furthermore do not\nfind a significant correlation between galaxy colour and virial mass, i.e.,\nparent dark matter halo mass.

This feature might be explained\neither by the late hot flasher scenario where stars experience the helium flash\nwhile on the white dwarf cooling curve or by the progeny of the helium-enriched\nsub-population postulated to exist in some clusters. Previous spectroscopic\nanalyses of blue hook stars in omega Cen and NGC 2808 support the late hot\nflasher scenario, but the stars contain much less helium than expected and the\npredicted C and N enrichment cannot be verified. We compare the observed\neffective temperatures, surface gravities, helium abundances, and carbon line\nstrengths (where detectable) of our targets stars with the predictions of the\ntwo aforementioned scenarios. Moderately high resolution spectra of hot HB\nstars in the globular cluster omega Cen were analysed for radial velocity\nvariations, atmospheric parameters, and abundances using LTE and non-LTE model\natmospheres. We find no evidence of close binaries among our target stars. All\nstars below 30,000K are helium-poor and very similar to HB stars observed in\nthat temperature range in other globular clusters. In the temperature range\n30,000K to 50,000K, we find that 28% of our stars are helium-poor (log(He/H) <\n-1.6), while 72% have roughly solar or super-solar helium abundance (log(He/H)\n>= -1.5). We also find that carbon enrichment is strongly correlated with\nhelium enrichment, with a maximum carbon enrichment of 3% by mass. A strong\ncarbon enrichment in tandem with helium enrichment is predicted by the late hot\nflasher scenario, but not by the helium-enrichment scenario. We conclude that\nthe helium-rich HB stars in omega Cen cannot be explained solely by the\nhelium-enrichment scenario invoked to explain the blue main sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 14:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In\nthis paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust\nsize distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a\nweakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.\nTo clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two\nsteps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming\na monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse\ngrowth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is\nmet, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically\nsimulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome\nchanges when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,\nunder certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a\nlimited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the\ndust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates\nefficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being\nstrongly charged.

Taking\nfully account of the CMB lensing, cosmic shear, CMB anisotropies, and their\ncross correlation signals, we clarify a role of each signal, and investigate\nthe extent to which the upcoming observations by a high-angular resolution\nexperiment of CMB and deep galaxy imaging survey can tightly constrain the\nneutrino mass and dark energy equation-of-state parameters. Including the\nprimary CMB information as a prior cosmological information, the Fisher\nanalysis reveals that the time varying equation-of-state parameters, given by\nw(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), can be tightly constrained with the accuracies of 5% for w_0\nand 15% for w_a, which are comparable to or even better than those of the\nstage-III type surveys neglecting the effect of massive neutrinos. In other\nwords, including the neutrino mass in the parameter estimation would not\ndrastically alter the Figure-of-Merit estimates of dark energy parameters from\nthe weak lensing measurements. For the neutrino mass, a clear signal for total\nneutrino mass with 0.1 eV can be detected with 2-sigma significance. The\nrobustness and sensitivity of these results are checked in detail by allowing\nthe setup of cosmic shear experiment to vary as a function of observation time\nor exposure time, showing that the improvement of the constraints very weakly\ndepends on the survey parameters, and the results mentioned above are nearly\noptimal for the dark energy parameters and the neutrino mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 15:49:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 09:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}
