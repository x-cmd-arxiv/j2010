Especially, a marked and quick rebrightening occurred at about t ~ 1.2\n* 10^5 s. Energy injection from late and slow shells seems to be the best\ninterpretation for these rebrightenings. Usually it is assumed that the energy\nis injected into the whole external shock. However, in the case of GRB 030329,\nthe rebrightenings are so quick that the usual consideration fails to give a\nsatisfactory fit to the observed light curves. Actually, since these late/slow\nshells coast freely in the wake of the external shock, they should be cold and\nmay not expand laterally. The energy injection then should only occur at the\ncentral region of the external shock. Considering this effect, we numerically\nre-fit the quick rebrightenings observed in GRB 030329. By doing this, we were\nable to derive the beaming angle of the energy injection process. Our result,\nwith a relative residual of only 5% - 10% during the major rebrightening, is\nbetter than any previous modeling. The derived energy injection angle is about\n0.035. We assume that these late shells are ejected by the central engine via\nthe same mechanism as those early shells that produce the prompt gamma-ray\nburst. The main difference is that their velocities are much slower, so that\nthey catch up with the external shock very lately and manifest as the observed\nquick rebrightenings. If this were true, then the derived energy injection\nangle can give a good measure of the beaming angle of the prompt gamma-ray\nemission. Our study may hopefully provide a novel method to measure the beaming\nangle of gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 11:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2010 03:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This can be ascribed to the more three dimensional\nelectronic structure found by ab initio calculations for the 122 materials,\nmaking this system less amenable to model development. In addition, the more\ncomplicated Brillouin zone (BZ) of the body-centered tetragonal symmetry does\nnot allow a straightforward unfolding of the electronic band structure into an\neffective 1Fe/unit cell BZ. Here we present an effective 5-orbital\ntight-binding fit of the full DFT band structure for BaFeAs including the kz\ndispersions. We compare the 5-orbital spin fluctuation model to one previously\nstudied for LaOFeAs and calculate the RPA enhanced susceptibility. Using the\nfluctuation exchange approximation to determine the leading pairing\ninstability, we then examine the differences between a strictly two dimensional\nmodel calculation over a single kz cut of the BZ and a completely three\ndimensional approach. We find pairing states quite similar to the 1111\nmaterials, with generic quasi-isotropic pairing on the hole sheets and nodal\nstates on the electron sheets at kz = 0 which however are gapped as the system\nis hole doped. On the other hand, a substantial kz dependence of the order\nparameter remains, with most of the pairing strength deriving from processes\nnear kz = pi.

A detailed correlation between\nthe sintering temperature, structure, onset transition temperature (Tc) and\ncritical current density (Jc) has been found in all samples of each batch. Most\nimportantly, samples sintered at a low temperature clearly shows high Tc, for\nexample the Tc of the samples sintered at 850C is even above 53 K, and the\nsamples prepared at 1000C display the highest Tc of 56.1 K reported so far.\nFurthermore, the samples sintered at 1000C also show the highest RRR and the\nlowest resistivity(57K), indicating the low impurity scattering and enhanced\ncarrier density. However, the maximum Jc of 10510 A/cm^2 at 5 K in self field\nwas achieved in the samples sintered at 1100oC. The dependence of Tc on a-axis\nlattice constant indicates that the sintering temperature has strong influence\non the effective substitution level of F for O. This result suggests that\nannealing at a temperature of ~1000C seems much better for obtaining high\nquality 1111 phase oxypnictides, compared to commonly used temperatures of\naround 1200C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 09:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
