By minimising the energy terms sequentially,\nfrom most to the least important, magnetization distributions are expressed as\nsolutions of Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem for a function of complex\nvariable. A number of free parameters, corresponding to positions of vortices\nand anti-vortices, still remain in the expression. These parameters can be\nfound by computing and minimizing the total magnetic energy of the particle\nwith no approximations. Thus, the presented approach is a factory of realistic\nRitz functions for analytical micromagnetic calculations.

The first is the\nsuggestion that the proper description of classical gravitational effects is\nthe gauge theory of gravity in which the connection instead of the metric acts\nas the dynamical variable. The resulting field equation does not then contain\nthe CC term. This removes the connection between the CC and the quantum vacuum\nenergy, and therefore addresses the {\\it old} CC problem of why quantum vacuum\nenergy does not gravitate. The CC-equivalent in this approach arises from the\nconstant of integration when reducing the field equation to the Einstein\nequation. The second is the assumption that the universe obeys de Sitter\nsymmetry, with the observed accelerating expansion as its manifestation. We\ncombine these ideas and identify the constant of integration with the\ninverse-square of the radius of curvature of the de Sitter space. The origin of\ndark energy (DE) is therefore associated with the inherent spacetime geometry,\nwith the smallness of DE protected by symmetry. This addresses the {\\it new} CC\nproblem, or the DE puzzle. This approach, however, faces major challenges from\nquantum considerations.

(2) We obtain median r_{eff}/h_r = 0.20, 0.15 and 0.10 for S0,\nS0/a-Sa and Sab-Sc galaxies: these are smaller than predicted by simulation\nmodels in which bulges are formed by galaxy mergers. (3) The properties of\nbulges of S0s are different from the elliptical galaxies, which is manifested\nin the M_K(bulge) vs r_{eff} relation, in the photometric plane, and to some\nextent also in the Kormendy relation. The bulges of S0s are similar to bulges\nof spirals with M_K(bulge) < -20 mag. Some S0s have small bulges, but their\nproperties are not compatible with the idea that they could evolve to dwarfs by\ngalaxy harassment. (4) The relative bulge flux B/T for S0s covers the full\nrange found in the Hubble sequence. (5) The values and relations of the\nparameters of the disks of the S0 galaxies in NIRS0S are similar to those\nobtained for spirals in the OSUBSGS. Overall, our results support the view that\nspiral galaxies with bulges brighter than -20 mag in the K-band can evolve\ndirectly into S0s, due to stripping of gas followed by truncated star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 17:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Large spots crossing the stellar\ndisc can produce planet-like periodic variations in the light curve of a star.\nThese spots clearly affect the spectral line profiles and their perturbations\nalter the line centroids creating a radial velocity jitter that might\ncontaminate\" the variations induced by a planet.

As a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationships\nbetween fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit a\ntransformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e, CaII H & K lines, to\nothers that hold noteworthy advantages. Methods: We used high resolution\n(~50000) echelle optical spectra. To determine the chromospheric emission of\nthe stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. Rotational\nvelocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique.

This\ncan easily be motivated by assuming a high scale framework of supersymmetry\nbreaking like minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). Due to the extremely small\nneutrino Yukawa coupling, the decay of the NLSP to the LSP is suppressed and\nconsequently the NLSP, here the lighter stau mass eigenstate, becomes stable at\nthe length scale of the detector. The collider signal in this case consists of\ncharged tracks of massive stable particles in the muon chamber.

An advantage of the CCM is that the Goldstone\nlinked-cluster theorem is obeyed at all levels of approximation and so it\nprovides results in the infinite lattice limit $N \\to \\infty$ from the outset.\nHowever, recent results have also shown that the CCM can provide exact\n(symmetry-breaking) results for the spin-half linear-chain $J_1$--$J_2$ at the\nMajumdar-Ghosh point $J_2/J_1=0.5$ by identifying special solutions of the CCM\nequations for the usual N\\'eel model state. Interestingly, the CCM provides\nexact (non-symmetry-breaking) results for systems in which small magnetic\nclusters become de-coupled from each other when the bonds connecting them tend\nto zero.

The typical evolutionary\nscenario involves star formation in small-n clusters which then progressively\nmerge; the first stars to form are seeds of massive stars and achieve a\nheadstart in mass acquisition. These massive seeds end up in the cores of\nclusters and a large fraction of new stars of lower mass is formed in the outer\nparts of the clusters. The resulting clusters are therefore mass segregated at\nan age of 0.5 Myr, although the signature of mass segregation is weakened\nduring mergers. We find that the resulting IMF has a smaller exponent\n(alpha=1.8-2.2) than the Salpeter value (alpha=2.35). The IMFs in subclusters\nare truncated at masses only somewhat larger than the most massive stars (which\ndepends on the richness of the cluster) and an universal upper mass limit of\n150 Msun is ruled out.

In addition, our\ncalculation shows that the line formation of B I will get closer to LTE if the\nstrength of collisions with neutral hydrogen increases, which is contrary to\nthe result of previous studies. The NLTE line formation results are applied to\nthe determination of boron abundances for a sample of 16 metal-poor stars with\nthe method of spectrum synthesis of the B I 2497 A resonance lines using the\narchived HST/GHRS spectra. Beryllium and oxygen abundances are also determined\nfor these stars. The abundances of the nine stars which are not depleted in Be\nor B show that, no matter the strength of collisions with neutral hydrogen may\nbe, both Be and B increase with O quasi-linearly in the logarithmic plane,\nwhich confirms the conclusions that Be and B are mainly produced by primary\nprocess in the early Galaxy. The most noteworthy result of this work is that B\nincreases with Fe or O at a very similar speed as, or a bit faster than Be\ndoes, which is in accord with the theoretical models. The B/Be ratios remain\nalmost constant over the metallicity range investigated here. Our average B/Be\nratio falls in the interval [13+-4, 17+-4], which is consistent with the\npredictions of spallation process. The contribution of B from the nu-process\nmay be required if the 11B/10B isotopic ratios in metal-poor stars are the same\nas the meteoric value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 21:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-07"}

The gravity background is constructed from a new solution we find\nof type IIB supergravity. This new solution is expected to be dual to\nnon-commutative Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit with global U(1)\ncurrents. We study the zero frequency, near horizon behavior of the fermion,\nwhere the equations of motion reduce to that of two interacting fermions in\nAdS$_2$ with an electric field. We show that the operator dimensions in the\nAdS$_2$ space are complex, leading to the two components of the retarded\nGreen's function in the dual theory to be complex conjugates of each other. In\norder to preserve unitarity, this result implies there are no zero frequency\nquasinormal modes in our system. This has important implications for\ngeneralizations of recent holographic Fermi liquid setups with AdS$_2$ regions,\nas it suggests that infinite lifetime excitations can have energies above/below\nthe chemical potential. Therefore, the Fermi energy may not be uniquely set by\nthe chemical potential. Furthermore, since the gravity background breaks\nrotational symmetry along the spatial directions of the dual Yang-Mills theory,\nwe do not expect the Fermi surface to be spherical in shape in momentum space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 22:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-25"}

The following results are reported: i) Cantor's proofs\nof nondenumerability are refuted by analyzing the logical inconsistencies in\nimplementation of the reductio method of proof and by identifying errors.\nParticular attention is given to the diagonalization argument and to the\ninterpretation of the axiom of infinity. ii) Three constructive proofs have\nbeen designed that support the denumerability of the power set of the natural\nnumbers, P(N), thus implying the denumerability of the set of the real numbers\nR. These results lead to a Theorem of the Continuum that supersedes Cantor's\nContinuum Hypothesis and establishes the countable nature of the real number\nline, suggesting that all infinite sets are denumerable. Some immediate\nimplications of denumerability are discussed: i) Valid proofs should not\ninclude inconceivable statements, defined as statements that can be found to be\nfalse and always lead to contradiction. This is formalized in a Principle of\nConceivable Proof. ii) Substantial simplification of the axiomatic principles\nof set theory can be achieved by excluding transfinite numbers.

Array-based comparative\ngenomic hybridization (aCGH) is a high-throughput technique for identifying DNA\ngain or loss by quantifying total amounts of DNA matching defined probes\nrelative to healthy diploid control samples. Due to the high level of noise in\nmicroarray data, however, interpretation of aCGH output is a difficult and\nerror-prone task.\n  In this work, we tackle the computational task of inferring the DNA copy\nnumber per genomic position from noisy aCGH data.

We derive asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion\n(of the MMSE estimate at the fusion centre) of these schemes as the number of\nsensors becomes large. For comparison, asymptotic expressions for the expected\ndistortion for a coherent multi-access scheme and an orthogonal access scheme\nare derived. We also study for the diversity schemes, the optimal power\nallocation for minimizing the expected distortion subject to average total\npower constraints. The effect of optimizing the probability of transmission on\nthe expected distortion in the distributed scenario is also studied. It is seen\nthat as opposed to the coherent multi-access scheme and the orthogonal scheme\n(where the expected distortion decays as 1/M, M being the number of sensors),\nthe expected distortion decays only as 1/ln(M) for the diversity schemes. This\nreduction of the decay rate can be seen as a tradeoff between the simplicity of\nthe diversity schemes and the strict synchronization and large bandwidth\nrequirements for the coherent multi-access and the orthogonal schemes,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 05:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-25"}

After\npresenting some properties of the algorithm, we present exact results on the\ntopological properties of graphs associated to random series, namely the degree\ndistribution, clustering coefficient, and mean path length.

Within the same\narm segment the regular magnetic field with the wavelength of 2.3 kpc was found\nby Beck et al. (1989). We noted that this wavelength is twice as large as the\nspacing between complexes and suggested that they were formed in result of\nmagneto-gravitational instability developed along the arm. In this NW arm, star\ncomplexes are located inside the gas-dust lane, whilst in the south-western arm\nof M31 the gas-dust lane is upstream of the bright and uniform stellar arm.\nEarlier, evidence for the age gradient has been found in the SW arm. All these\nare signatures of a spiral shock, which may be associated with unusually large\n(for M31) pitch-angle of this SW arm segment. Such a shock may prevent the\nformation of the regular magnetic field, which might explain the absence of\nstar complexes there. Anti-correlation between shock wave signatures and\npresence of star complexes is observed in spiral arms of a few other galaxies.\nRegular chains of star complexes and superclouds in spiral arms are rare, which\nmay imply that a rather specific mechanism is involved in their formation, and\nthe most probable one is the Parker-Jeans instability. The spiral pattern of\nour Galaxy is briefly discussed; it may be of M101 type in the outer parts. The\nregular bi-modal spacing of HI superclouds is found in Carina and Cygnus\n(Outer) arms, which may be an indirect evidence for the regular magnetic field\nalong these arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 14:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
