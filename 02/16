For those with\nspectral functions having only finitely many different values, we prove the\nresults by utilizing a special product decomposition of the coefficient matrix\nof the Pade system. The results in this paper can be considered as an extension\nof the Pade theory for Stieltjes functions whose spectral function take\ninfinitely many different values to those taking only finitely many values. In\nthe literature, the latter is usually excluded from the definition of Stieltjes\nfunctions because they correspond to rational functions, hence convergence of\ntheir Pade approximants is trivial. However, from an inverse problem point of\nview, our main concern is the existence of the nonstandard Pade approximants,\nrather than their convergence. The results in this paper provide a mathematical\nfoundation for applying the Pade approach for reconstructing the spectral\nfunctions of composites whose microstructure is not a priori known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 17:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 02:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-25"}

Although as a result of those measurements the disagreement is\nnow drastically smaller, it remains formally at the level of 50%, possibly due\nto errors in the measured apsidal motion rate, outdated stellar models, or\ninaccuracies in the stellar parameters. Here we address each of these issues in\norder to improve the agreement further. New times of minimum have been\ncollected in order to redetermine the apsidal motion rate. We have computed new\nstellar evolution models with updated physical inputs, and derived improved\napsidal motion constants for the components. We have performed Monte Carlo\nsimulations to infer the theoretical distribution of dw/dt, including the\ncontributions from GR as well as tidal and rotational distortions.

In contrast to existing cellular systems,\nfemtocells are end-user deployed and controlled, randomly located, and rely on\nthird party backhaul (e.g. DSL or cable modem). Femtocells can be configured to\nbe either open access or closed access. Open access allows an arbitrary nearby\ncellular user to use the femtocell, whereas closed access restricts the use of\nthe femtocell to users explicitly approved by the owner. Seemingly, the network\noperator would prefer an open access deployment since this provides an\ninexpensive way to expand their network capabilities, whereas the femtocell\nowner would prefer closed access, in order to keep the femtocell's capacity and\nbackhaul to himself. We show mathematically and through simulations that the\nreality is more complicated for both parties, and that the best approach\ndepends heavily on whether the multiple access scheme is orthogonal (TDMA or\nOFDMA, per subband) or non-orthogonal (CDMA). In a TDMA/OFDMA network,\nclosed-access is typically preferable at high user densities, whereas in CDMA,\nopen access can provide gains of more than 200% for the home user by reducing\nthe near-far problem experienced by the femtocell. The results of this paper\nsuggest that the interests of the femtocell owner and the network operator are\nmore compatible than typically believed, and that CDMA femtocells should be\nconfigured for open access whereas OFDMA or TDMA femtocells should adapt to the\ncellular user density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 22:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

In this regime warps are know to propagate\ndiffusively, with a diffusion coefficient approximately inversely proportional\nto the disc viscosity. Previous numerical investigations of this problem\n(Lodato & Pringle 2007) did not find a good agreement between the numerical\nresults and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both\nin the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new,\nlow-memory and highly efficient SPH code to run a large set of very high\nresolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation,\nimplementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the\norigin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. Our new\nand improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory\nboth in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion\ncoefficient and precession rate. It is worth noting that the resulting\ndiffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the disc viscosity only for\nsmall amplitude warps and small values of the disc $\\alpha$ coefficient\n($\\alpha < 0.1$). For non-linear warps, the diffusion coefficient is a function\nof both radius and time, and is significantly smaller than the standard value.\nWarped accretion discs are present in many contexts, from protostellar discs to\naccretion discs around supermassive black holes. In all such cases, the exact\nvalue of the warp diffusion coefficient may strongly affect the evolution of\nthe system and therefore its careful evaluation is critical in order to\ncorrectly estimate the system dynamics (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 22:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The question is how can matter, ordinary\nmatter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we\nobserve ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor (steam) rise from a\npot of heated water. The nature of the phases is brought into the sharpest\nfocus in phase transitions: abrupt changes from one phase to another and hence\nchanges from one behavior to another. This article starts with the development\nof mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of phase transition\nphenomena. It then goes on to the limitations of mean field theory and the\ndevelopment of very different supplementary understanding through the\nrenormalization group concept.\n  Throughout, the behavior at the phase transition is illuminated by an\n\"extended singularity theorem\", which says that a sharp phase transition only\noccurs in the presence of some sort of infinity in the statistical system. The\nusual infinity is in the system size. Apparently this result caused some\nconfusion at a 1937 meeting celebrating van der Waals, since mean field theory\ndoes not respect this theorem. In contrast, renormalization theories can make\nuse of the theorem. This possibility, in fact, accounts for some of the\nstrengths of renormalization methods in dealing with phase transitions. The\npaper outlines the different ways phase transition phenomena reflect the\neffects of this theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 01:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

If this theory possess an infrared\nfixed point, as indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory, it is a\nconformal(unparticle) field theory. If, on the other hand, a chiral condensate\nforms on the weak-coupling side of this would-be fixed point, the theory\nremains confining. The only difference between such a theory and regular QCD is\nthat there is a range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs\nvery slowly (walks). In this first analysis, we simulate the lattice version of\nQCD with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of\ntemporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6. The deconfinement and chiral-symmetry\nrestoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with\nconfinement and chiral-symmetry breaking.

These may be the cores of stars that have each been eroded or disrupted\nby a companion star. The companion, which is the star monitored today, is\nlikely to have gained mass from its now-defunct partner, and can be considered\nto be a blue straggler. KOI-81 is almost certainly the product of stable mass\ntransfer; KOI-74 may be as well, or it may be the first clear example of a blue\nstraggler created throughthree-body interactions.\n  We show that mass transfer binaries are common enough that Kepler should\ndiscover ~1000 white dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars. Most, like KOI-74 and\nKOI-81, will be discovered through transits, but many will be discovered\nthrough a combination of gravitational lensing and transits, while lensing will\ndominate for a subset. In fact, some events caused by white dwarfs will have\nthe appearance of \"anti-transits\" --i.e., short-lived enhancements in the\namount of light received from the monitored star. Lensing and other mass\nmeasurements methods provide a way to distinguish white dwarf binaries from\nplanetary systems. This is important for the success of Kepler's primary\nmission, in light of the fact that white dwarf radii are similar to the radii\nof terrestrial planets, and that some white dwarfs will have orbital periods\nthat place them in the habitable zones of their stellar companions. By\nidentifying transiting and/or lensing white dwarfs, Kepler will conduct\npioneering studies of white dwarfs and of the end states of mass transfer.

HD101412 is the first Herbig Ae star for which the rotational Doppler\neffect was found to be small in comparison to the magnetic splitting. The\nmeasured mean magnetic field modulus varies from 2.5 to 3.5kG, while the mean\nquadratic field was found to vary in the range of 3.5 to 4.8kG. To determine\nthe period of variations, we used radial velocity, equivalent width, line\nwidth, and line asymmetry measurements of variable spectral lines of several\nelements, as well as magnetic field measurements. The most pronounced\nvariability was detected for spectral lines of He I and the iron peak elements,\nwhereas the spectral lines of CNO elements are only slightly variable. From\nspectral variations and magnetic field measurements we derived a potential\nrotation period P_rot=13.86d, which has to be proven in future studies with a\nlarger number of observations. It is the first time that the presence of\nelement spots is detected on the surface of a Herbig Ae/Be star. Our previous\nstudy of Herbig Ae stars revealed a trend towards stronger magnetic fields for\nyounger Herbig Ae stars, confirmed by statistical tests. This is in contrast to\na few other (non-statistical) studies claiming that magnetic Herbig Ae stars\nare progenitors of the magnetic Ap stars. New developments in MHD theory show\nthat the measured magnetic field strengths are compatible with a current-driven\ninstability of toroidal fields generated by differential rotation in the\nstellar interior. This explanation for magnetic intermediate-mass stars could\nbe an alternative to a frozen-in fossil field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 09:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Previous attempts to\nrecover the DTD have used comparisons of mean SN rates vs. redshift to cosmic\nstar-formation history (SFH), or comparison of SN rates among galaxies of\ndifferent mean ages. We present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids\nsuch averaging. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of\nSNe discovered in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one or a few SNe). We\napply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 SNe Ia and 119\ncore-collapse SNe (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory SN Search (LOSS), with\nSFHs reconstructed from SDSS spectra. We find a >2sigma SN Ia DTD signal in our\nshortest-delay, \"prompt\", bin at <420 Myr. Despite a systematic error, due to\nthe limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, which causes some of the\nprompt signal to leak to the later DTD bins, the data require prompt SNe Ia at\nthe >99% confidence. We further find, at 4sigma, SNe Ia that are \"delayed\" by >\n2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe\nIa. The time integral over the CC SN DTD is 0.010+/-0.002 SNe per Msun, as\nexpected if all stars of mass >8 Msun lead to visible SN explosions.

Among others, an interesting\nfeature is the def- inition of transformations as concept-oriented rules, i.e.\nbased on types of model elements where the types are organized into a hierarchy\ncalled a metamodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 13:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

Such methods are highly beneficial in terms of spectrum\nutilization. However, excessive fragmentation degrades performance and hence\noff-sets the benefits. Thus, there is a need to study these processes so as to\ndetermine how to ensure acceptable levels of fragmentation. Hence, we present\nexperimental and analytical results derived from a mathematical model. We model\na system operating at capacity serving requests for bandwidth by assigning a\ncollection of gaps (sub-channels) with no limitations on the fragment size. Our\nmain theoretical result shows that even if fragments can be arbitrarily small,\nthe system does not degrade with time. Namely, the average total number of\nfragments remains bounded. Within the very difficult class of dynamic\nfragmentation models (including models of storage fragmentation), this result\nappears to be the first of its kind.

It is shown that for vanishing\nnon-adiabatic pressure of matter the large scale evolution of cosmological\nperturbations converges to that described by a single constant, $\\zeta$, which\nis an analog of a curvature perturbation on the uniform-density slicing\ncommonly used in usual gravitational theories. The subsequent evolution is thus\ndetermined completely by the value of $\\zeta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 15:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 06:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

These exchanges allow real-time\nbidding, that is, each time the publisher contacts the exchange, the exchange\n``calls out'' to solicit bids from ad networks. This aspect of soliciting bids\nintroduces a novel aspect, in contrast to existing literature. This suggests\ndeveloping a joint optimization framework which optimizes over the allocation\nand well as solicitation. We model this selective call out as an online\nrecurrent Bayesian decision framework with bandwidth type constraints. We\nobtain natural algorithms with bounded performance guarantees for several\nnatural optimization criteria. We show that these results hold under different\ncall out constraint models, and different arrival processes. Interestingly, the\npaper shows that under MHR assumptions, the expected revenue of generalized\nsecond price auction with reserve is constant factor of the expected welfare.\nAlso the analysis herein allow us prove adaptivity gap type results for the\nadwords problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 15:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 16:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In rings with many\nconducting channels a much smoother and broader PC noise spectrum is expected.\nA specific feature of PC noise is that its spectrum can be tuned by an external\nmagnetic flux indicating the presence of quantum coherence in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 15:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 11:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-22"}
