For generic\nangles supersymmetry is completely broken and there is an open string tachyon\nbetween the branes. The field theory action for this system is obtained by\ncoupling to N =4 super Yang-Mills two N =2 hyper multiplets in the fundamental\nrepresentation of the SU(N) gauge group, but with different choices of\nembedding of the two N=2 subalgebras into N=4. On the field theory side we find\na one-loop Coleman-Weinberg instability in the effective potential for the\nfundamental scalars.

However, interactions do not necessarily take\nplace between single variables, but may occur among groups, or \"ensembles\", of\nvariables.

The relative\nlens-source motion results in a time-variable source magnification: a\nmicrolensing event.

We derive photometric metallicity\ndistribution functions of stars on the upper red giant branch via isochrone\ninterpolation. The 6 galaxies are moderately metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>=-1.56 to\n-1.08), and metallicity spreads are observed (internal dispersions of\nsigma_[Fe/H]=0.10 to 0.41 dex). We also investigate the possible presence of\nintermediate-age stars, and discuss how these affect our results. The dwarfs\nexhibit flat to weak radial metallicity gradients. For the two most luminous,\nmost metal-rich galaxies, we find statistically significant evidence for at\nleast two stellar subpopulations: the more metal-rich stars are found in the\ncenter of the galaxies, while the metal-poor ones are more broadly distributed\nwithin the galaxies. We find no clear trend of the derived physical properties\nas a function of (present-day) galaxy position in the group, which may be due\nto the small sample we investigate.

The gas in the inner, bright region of the front is ~40% more\nabundant in Fe than the gas outside the front, suggesting the important role of\nsloshing in transporting metals through the ICM.

The systematic suppression of FM state results in a spin glass (SG)\nlike behavior.

Most prior work on interference alignment, however, neglects\ninterference from other nodes in the network not participating in the alignment\noperation. This paper proposes three generalizations of interference alignment\nfor the multiple-antenna interference channel with multiple users that account\nfor colored noise, which models uncoordinated interference. First, a minimum\ninterference-plus-noise leakage algorithm is presented, and shown to be\nequivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or\nnegligible. A joint minimum mean squared error design is then proposed that\njointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, whereas\nprevious designs neglect the receive spatial filter. This algorithm is shown to\nbe a generalization of previous joint MMSE designs for other system\nconfigurations such as the broadcast channel. Finally, a maximum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm is developed that is proven\nto converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The latter two designs\nare shown to have increased complexity due to non-orthogonal precoders, more\nrequired iterations, or more channel state knowledge than the min INL or\nsubspace methods. The sum throughput performance of these algorithms is\nsimulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers\nnot participating in the alignment protocol. It is found that a network with\ncochannel interference can benefit from employing precoders designed to\nconsider that interference, but in some cases, ignoring the co-channel\ninterference is advantageous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 08:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 02:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

At the distance of the galaxy, the half-light radius of the cluster\nis r_h ~ 17pc, placing it among the largest globular clusters known. The faint\nabsolute magnitude of the star cluster, M_(V,o)=-5.2, and its large size render\nthis object somewhat different from the population of extended globular\nclusters previously reported, making it the first firm detection in the\noutskirts of a giant galaxy of an analogue of the faint, diffuse globular\nclusters present in the outer halo of the Milky Way. The colour-magnitude\ndiagram of the cluster, covering approximately the brightest four magnitudes of\nthe red giant branch, is consistent with an ancient, i.e., older than ~8 Gyr,\nintermediate-metallicity, i.e., [M/H] ~-1.0 dex, stellar population. We also\nreport the detection of a second, even fainter cluster candidate which would\nhave r_h ~ 9pc, and M_(V,o)=-3.4 if it is at the distance of NGC 5128. The\nproperties of the extended globular cluster and the diffuse stellar populations\nin its close vicinity suggest that they are part of a low mass accretion in the\nouter regions of NGC 5128.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 11:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

On the other hand,\ncalculations for laboratory experiments show that saturation is achieved\nthrough modification of the background shear for Pm << 1. Guided by the results\nof calculations appropriate for laboratory experiments when Pm is very low, the\naxisymmetric stability of inviscid disturbances in a shearing box model\nimmersed in a constant vertical background magnetic field is considered under a\nvariety of shear profiles and boundary conditions in order to evaluate the\nhypothesis that modifications of the shear bring about saturation of the\ninstability. It is found that the emergence and stability of the MRI is\nsensitive to the boundary conditions adopted. Channel modes do not appear to be\nstabilized through any modification of the background shear whose average\nremains Keplerian. However, systems that have non-penetrative boundaries can\nsaturate the MRI through modification of the background shear. Conceptually\nequating the qualitative results from laboratory experiments to the conditions\nin a disk may therefore be misleading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 15:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\ncolloidal rods are modelled as hard cylinders of the same diameter and\ndifferent lengths, in the approximation of perfect alignment. A\nfundamental--measure density functional is used to obtain equilibrium density\nprofiles and thermodynamic properties such as surface tensions and adsorption\ncoefficients. The bulk phase diagram exhibits nematic-smectic and\nsmectic-smectic demixing, with smectic phases having different compositions; in\nsome cases they are microfractionated. The calculated surface phase diagram of\nthe wall-nematic interface shows a very rich phase behavior, including layering\ntransitions and complete wetting at high pressures, whereby an infinitely thick\nsmectic film grows at the wall via an infinite sequence of stepwise\nfirst--order layering transitions. For lower pressures complete wetting also\nobtains, but here the smectic film grows in a continuous fashion. Finally, at\nvery low pressures, the wall-nematic interface exhibits critical adsorption by\nthe smectic phase, due to the second-order character of the bulk\nnematic-smectic transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 15:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

Allowing only\nsingle site occupation, we realize mobility by exchanging individuals of\ndifferent species. When the interaction and swapping rates are symmetric, a\nstrongly enhanced swapping rate yields an increased mixing of the species,\nleading to a mean-field like coexistence even in one-dimensional systems. This\ncoexistence is transient when the rates are asymmetric, and eventually only one\nspecies will survive. Interestingly, in our spatial games the dominating\nspecies can differ from the species that would dominate in the corresponding\nnonspatial model.
