This power law is inconsistent with standard\ndispersal mechanisms such as cluster evaporation and cloud collisions. In the\nconventional interpretation, it requires the unlikely situation where diverse\nmechanisms stitch together over time in a way that is independent of\nenvironment or M. Here we consider another model in which the large scale\ndistribution of gas in each star-forming region plays an important role. We\nnote that star clusters form with positional and temporal correlations in giant\ncloud complexes, and suggest that these complexes dominate the tidal force and\ncollisional influence on a cluster during its first several hundred million\nyears. Because the cloud complex density decreases regularly with position from\nthe cluster birth site, the harassment and collision rates between the cluster\nand the cloud pieces decrease regularly with age as the cluster drifts. This\ndecrease is typically a power law of the form required to explain the mass-age\ndistribution. We reproduce this distribution for a variety of cases, including\nrapid disruption, slow erosion, combinations of these two, cluster-cloud\ncollisions, cluster disruption by hierarchical disassembly, and partial cluster\ndisruption. We also consider apparent cluster mass loss by fading below the\nsurface brightness limit of a survey. In all cases, the observed log M - \\log T\ndiagram can be reproduced under reasonable assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 04:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Throats are a\ncommon feature of the landscape of type IIB string theory. If a throat is\nheated during cosmological evolution, energy is subsequently transferred to\nother throats and to the standard model. We calculate the heat transfer rate\nand the decay rate of throat-localized Kaluza-Klein states in a ten-dimensional\nmodel. For the calculation, we employ the dual description of the throats in\nterms of gauge theories. We discuss modifications of the decay rate which arise\nin flux compactifications and for Klebanov-Strassler throats and emphasize the\nrole of tachyonic scalars in such throats in mediating decays of Kaluza-Klein\nmodes. Our results are also applicable to the energy transfer from the heated\nstandard model to throats. We determine the resulting energy density in throats\nat our epoch in dependence of their infrared scales and of the reheating\ntemperature. The Kaluza-Klein modes in the throats decay to other sectors with\na highly suppressed rate. If their lifetime is longer than the age of the\nuniverse, they are an interesting dark matter candidate. We show that, if the\nreheating temperature was 10^10 - 10^11 GeV, throats with infrared scales in\nthe range of 10^5 GeV to 10^10 GeV can account for the observed dark matter.

Line cooling by\nmolecular hydrogen can be suppressed in the presence of a strong\nsoft-ultraviolet radiation field, but the role played by other cooling\nmechanisms is less clear. In optically thin gas, Lyman-Alpha cooling can be\nvery effective, maintaining the gas temperature below 10^4 K over many orders\nof magnitude in density. However, the large neutral hydrogen column densities\npresent in primordial galaxies render them highly optically thick to\nLyman-Alpha photons. In this letter, we examine in detail the effects of the\ntrapping of these Lyman-Alpha photons on the thermal and chemical evolution of\nthe gas. We show that despite the high optical depth in the Lyman series lines,\ncooling is not strongly suppressed, and proceeds via other atomic hydrogen\ntransitions, in particular the 2s-1s and the 3-2 transitions. At densities\nlarger than 10^9 cm^{-3}, collisional dissociation of molecular hydrogen\nbecomes the dominant cooling process and decreases the gas temperature to about\n5000 K. The gas temperature evolves with density as $T \\propto\n\\rho^{\\gamma_{\\rm eff} - 1}$, with $\\gamma_{\\rm eff} = 0.97-0.98$. The\nevolution is thus very close to isothermal, and so fragmentation is possible,\nbut unlikely to occur during the initial collapse. However, after the formation\nof a massive central object, we expect that later-infalling, higher angular\nmomentum material will form an accretion disk that may be unstable to\nfragmentation, which may give rise to star formation with a top-heavy IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 11:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The method is\ninverse optimal because the running cost that renders the control input optimal\nis also explicitly determined. One special feature of this work, as compared to\nother methods in the literature, is the fact that the solution is obtained\ndirectly for the control input. The value function can also be obtained after\none solves for the control input. Furthermore, a Lyapunov function that proves\nat least local stability of the controller is also obtained. In this regard the\nmain contribution of this paper can be interpreted in two different ways:\noffering an analytical expression for Lyapunov functions for a class of\nnonlinear systems and obtaining an optimal controller for the same class of\nsystems using a specific optimization functional. We also believe that an\nadditional contribution of this paper is to identify explicit classes of\nsystems and optimization functionals for which optimal control problems can be\nsolved analytically.
