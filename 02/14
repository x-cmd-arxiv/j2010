Using simultaneously all the available data from UV to\nradio we have modeled the spectral energy distributions of the six known\nspectroscopically confirmed SMGs at z>4. We find that their star formation\nrates (average ~2500 MSun yr^{-1}), stellar (~3.6x10^{11} MSun) and dust\n(~6.7x10^{8} MSun) masses, extinction (A_V~2.2 mag), and gas-to-dust ratios\n(~60) are within the ranges for 1.7<z<3.6 SMGs. Our analysis suggests that\ninfrared-to-radio luminosity ratios of SMGs do not change up to redshift ~5 and\nare lower by a factor of ~2.1 than the value corresponding to the local\nIR-radio correlation. However, we also find dissimilarities between z>4 and\nlower-redshift SMGs. Those at z>4 tend to be among the most star-forming, least\nmassive and hottest (~60 K) SMGs and exhibit the highest fraction of stellar\nmass formed in the ongoing starburst (~45%). This indicates that at z>4 we see\nearlier stages of evolution of submillimeter-bright galaxies. Using the derived\nproperties for z>4 SMGs we investigate the origin of dust at epochs less than\n1.5 Gyr after the big bang. This is significant to our understanding of the\nevolution of the early universe. For three z>4 SMGs, asymptotic giant branch\nstars could be the dominant dust producers. However, for the remaining three\nonly supernovae (SNe) are efficient and fast enough to be responsible for dust\nproduction, though requiring a very high dust yield per SN (0.15-0.65 MSun).\nThe required dust yields are lower if a top-heavy initial mass function or\nsignificant dust growth in the interstellar medium is assumed. We estimate\nlower limits of the contribution of SMGs to the cosmic star formation and\nstellar mass densities at z~4-5 to be ~4% and ~1%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2010 16:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 18:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-13"}

Demonstrating that a putative signal is due to WIMPs, and\nnot backgrounds, is a major challenge however. The direction dependence of the\nWIMP scattering rate provides a potential WIMP `smoking gun'. If the WIMP\ndistribution is predominantly smooth, the Galactic recoil distribution is\npeaked in the direction opposite to the direction of Solar motion. Previous\nstudies have found that, for an ideal detector, of order 10 WIMP events would\nbe sufficient to reject isotropy, and rule out an isotropic background. We\nexamine how the median recoil direction could be used to confirm the WIMP\norigin of an anisotropic recoil signal. Specifically we determine the number of\nevents required to reject the null hypothesis that the median direction is\nrandom (corresponding to an isotropic Galactic recoil distribution) at 95%\nconfidence. We find that for zero background 31 events are required, a factor\nof roughly 2 more than are required to simply reject isotropy. We also\ninvestigate the effect of a non-zero isotropic background. As the background\nrate is increased the number of events required increases, initially fairly\ngradually and then more rapidly, once the signal becomes subdominant.

First, we\nbriefly review results obtained using an extended Dirac equation, which\nconclusively showed that, as a consequence of quantum relativistic corrections\narising from the time-dependence of the rest-energy, the electron gyromagnetic\nfactors are corrected. It is next demonstrated, using the data of Kusch & Foley\non the measurement of deltaS minus 2 deltaL together with the modern precise\nmeasurements of the electron deltaS where deltaS identically equal to gS minus\n2, that deltaL may be a small, non-zero quantity, where we have assumed\nRussel-Saunders LS coupling and proposed, along with Kusch and Foley, that gS =\n2 plus deltaS and gS = 1 plus deltaL. Therefore, there is probable evidence\nfrom experimental data that gS is not exactly equal to 1; the expectation that\nquantum effects will significantly modify the classical value of the orbital g\nis therefore reasonable. Finally, we show that if, as suggested by the results\nobtained from the modified Dirac theory, deltaS and deltaL depend linearly on a\ndimensionless parameter DELTA such that the gyromagnetic factors are considered\ncorrected as follows; gS = 2 plus 2 DELTA and gL = 1 minus DELTA, then the\nKusch-Foley data implies that the correction DELTA approximately equals 1.0\ntimes 10-3 . Modern, high precision measurements of the electron and muon\norbital gL are therefore required, in order to properly determine by\nexperiments the true value of gL minus 1, perhaps to about one part in a\ntrillion as was recently done for gS minus 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2010 00:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

In the high\ntemperature phase just above the Verwey transition, the intensity at the Fermi\nlevel (EF) is still negligible, but it increases gradually with further\nincreasing the temperature (250 K, 330 K) in consistence with the temperature\ndependence of the conductivity. The spectral behaviors near EF with temperature\nare well explained by the model, which takes the polaron effect into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2010 14:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

In\nthe case of two atoms, there is a family of interaction-bound \"dimer\" states of\nco-localized particles that exists invariantly for either attractive or\nrepulsive on-site interaction, with the energy below or above the two-particle\nscattering continuum, respectively. Adding then the third particle -- \"monomer\"\n-- we find that, apart from the simple strongly-bound \"trimer\" corresponding to\nall three particles occupying the same lattice site, there are two peculiar\nfamilies of weakly-bound trimers with energies below and above the\nmonomer-dimer scattering continuum, the corresponding binding mechanism being\nan effective particle exchange interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2010 15:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
