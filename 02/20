The planet is found to experience cyclic episodes of rapid decay in\norbital radius, each amounting to a few Hill radii. We find this to be due to\nthe scattering of large- scale vortices present in the disc. The origin and\nrole of vortices in the context of type III migration is explored. It is shown\nthrough numerical simulations and semi- analytical modelling that spiral shocks\ninduced by a sufficiently massive planet will extend close to the planet\norbital radius. The production of vortensity across shock tips results in thin\nhigh vortensity rings with a characteristic width of the local scale height.\nFor planets with masses equal to and above that of Saturn, the rings are\nco-orbital features extending the entire azimuth. Linear stability analysis\nshow there exists unstable modes that are localised about local vortensity\nminima which coincide with gap edges. Simulations show that vortices are\nnon-linear a outcome. We used hydrodynamic simulations to examine vortex-planet\ninteractions. Their effect is present in discs with kinematic viscosity less\nthan about an order of magnitude smaller than the typically adopted value of\n\\nu = 10^{-5}\\Omega_pr_p(0)^2, where r_p(0) and \\Omega_p are the initial\norbital radius and angular velocity of the planet respectively. We find that\nthe magnitude of viscosity affects the nature of type III migration but not the\nextent of the orbital decay. The role of vortices as a function of initial disc\nmass is also explored and it is found that the amount of orbital decay during\none episode of vortex-planet interaction is independent of initial disc mass.\nWe incorporate the concept of the co-orbital mass deficit in the analysis of\nour results and link it to the presence of vortices at gap edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 16:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

Specifically, for\ncoarse-graining in the magnitude of a signal, we consider (i) the Floor, (ii)\nthe Symmetry and (iii) the Centro-Symmetry coarse-graining methods. We find,\nthat for anti-correlated signals coarse-graining in the magnitude leads to a\ncrossover to random behavior at large scales, and that with increasing the\nwidth of the coarse-graining partition interval $\\Delta$ this crossover moves\nto intermediate and small scales. In contrast, the scaling of positively\ncorrelated signals is less affected by the coarse-graining, with no observable\nchanges when $\\Delta<1$, while for $\\Delta>1$ a crossover appears at small\nscales and moves to intermediate and large scales with increasing $\\Delta$. For\nvery rough coarse-graining ($\\Delta>3$) based on the Floor and Symmetry\nmethods, the position of the crossover stabilizes, in contrast to the\nCentro-Symmetry method where the crossover continuously moves across scales and\nleads to a random behavior at all scales, thus indicating a much stronger\neffect of the Centro-Symmetry compared to the Floor and the Symmetry methods.\nFor coarse-graining in time, where data points are averaged in non-overlapping\ntime windows, we find that the scaling for both anti-correlated and positively\ncorrelated signals is practically preserved. The results of our simulations are\nuseful for the correct interpretation of the correlation and scaling properties\nof symbolic sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 22:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The detailed understanding of the dissipation and\naccompanying acceleration at these shocks is a currently topical subject. This\npaper explores the relationship between GRB prompt emission spectra and the\nelectron (or ion) acceleration properties at the relativistic shocks that\npertain to GRB models. The focus is on the array of possible high-energy\npower-law indices in accelerated populations, highlighting how spectra above 1\nMeV can probe the field obliquity in GRB internal shocks, and the character of\nhydromagnetic turbulence in their environs. It is emphasized that diffusive\nshock acceleration theory generates no canonical spectrum at relativistic MHD\ndiscontinuities. This diversity is commensurate with the significant range of\nspectral indices discerned in prompt burst emission. Such system diagnostics\nare now being enhanced by the broadband spectral coverage of bursts by the\nFermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope; while the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)\nprovides key diagnostics on the lower energy portions of the particle\npopulation, the focus here is on constraints in the non-thermal, power-law\nregime of the particle distribution that are provided by the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2010 02:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Of particular interests, these two laws often appear together. Many\ntheoretical models and analyses are performed to understand their co-occurrence\nin real systems, but it still lacks a clear picture about their relation.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We show that the Heaps' law can be considered\nas a derivative phenomenon if the system obeys the Zipf's law. Furthermore, we\nrefine the known approximate solution of the Heaps' exponent provided the\nZipf's exponent. We show that the approximate solution is indeed an asymptotic\nsolution for infinite systems, while in the finite-size system the Heaps'\nexponent is sensitive to the system size. Extensive empirical analysis on tens\nof disparate systems demonstrates that our refined results can better capture\nthe relation between the Zipf's and Heaps' exponents. Conclusions/Significance:\nThe present analysis provides a clear picture about the relation between the\nZipf's law and Heaps' law without the help of any specific stochastic model,\nnamely the Heaps' law is indeed a derivative phenomenon from Zipf's law. The\npresented numerical method gives considerably better estimation of the Heaps'\nexponent given the Zipf's exponent and the system size.

The chemical enrichment\nserves as one of the cornerstones of cosmological evolution. In order to\nunderstand this chemical evolution in morphologically different astrophysical\nobjects models are constructed based on analytical descriptions or numerical\nmethods. For the comparison of their chemical issues, as there are element\nabundances, gradients, and ratios, with observations not only the present-day\nvalues are used but also their temporal evolution from the first era of metal\nenrichment. Here we will provide some insight into basics of chemical evolution\nmodels, highlight advancements, and discuss a few applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2010 13:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

When the agents'\npreferences are single-dimensional Myerson's seminal work [Myerson '81] shows\nthat randomness offers no benefit--the optimal mechanism is always\ndeterministic. In the multi-dimensional case, where each agent's preferences\nare given by different values for each of the available services, Briest et al.\n[Briest, Chawla, Kleinberg, and Weinberg '10] recently showed that the gap\nbetween the expected revenue obtained by an optimal randomized mechanism and an\noptimal deterministic mechanism can be unbounded even when a single agent is\noffered only 4 services. However, this large gap is attained through unnatural\ninstances where values of the agent for different services are correlated in a\nspecific way. We show that when the agent's values involve no correlation or a\nspecific kind of positive correlation, the benefit of randomness is only a\nsmall constant factor (4 and 8 respectively).

Then we explore how two great analogies, computational and\nbiological, can give new insights into our problem. This paper includes a\npreliminary study to examine the two analogies. Importantly, analogies are both\nuseful and fundamental cognitive tools, but can also be misused or\nmisinterpreted. The idea that our universe might be modelled as a computational\nentity is analysed, and we discuss the distinction between physical laws and\ninitial conditions using algorithmic information theory. Smolin introduced the\ntheory of \"Cosmological Natural Selection\" with a biological analogy in mind.\nWe examine an extension of this analogy involving intelligent life. We discuss\nif and how this extension could be legitimated.\n  Keywords: origin of the universe, fine-tuning, physical constants, initial\nconditions, computational universe, biological universe, role of intelligent\nlife, cosmological natural selection, cosmological artificial selection,\nartificial cosmogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2010 15:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}
