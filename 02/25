We use the absolute size\nand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits on\nthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,\ncharged leptons and monochromatic photons. Predicted gamma-ray fluxes from\nannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distribution\nof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structure\nformation we assess these uncertainties. We also quantify how the dark matter\nconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on the\nUniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. In reasonable background and\ndark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it is\npossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons and\npositrons measured by the Fermi-LAT and PAMELA experiments. Derived limits also\nstart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. in\nminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. For the\nmonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only dark\nmatter scenarios with very strong signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 20:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We obtain 3D maps of the\nopacity and the distance to the main dust-bearing clouds with 250 pc.\n  We calculate the integrated extinction between the Sun and the cube boundary\nand compare with the total galactic extinction derived from infrared 2D maps.\nWe also compare the opacity distribution with the 3D distribution of\ninterstellar neutral sodium resulting from the inversion of sodium columns\ntowards about 1,700 target stars. Our maps show a larger high latitude dust\nopacity in the North compared to the South, while gas maps do not show the same\nasymmetry, suggesting a polar asymmetry of the dust to gas ratio at small\ndistances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 16:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Existing calculations solve\nthe equations inside the diffusion zone, where galactic magnetic fields confine\npositrons, and assume vanishing positron density on the boundaries of this\nzone. However, in many models, a substantial fraction of the dark matter halo\nlies outside the diffusion zone. Positrons produced there can then enter the\ndiffusion zone and get trapped, potentially reaching the Earth and increasing\nthe expected flux. We calculate this enhancement for a variety of models.

From\nthese noise-corrupted data a density-based statistical data model is derived.\nUsing this data model the parameter distribution within the cell population is\ncomputed using convex optimization techniques.\n  To evaluate the proposed method, a model for the caspase activation cascade\nis considered. It is shown that for known noise properties the unknown\nparameter distributions in this model are well estimated by the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 18:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-25"}

The spectrum we measure is strikingly different from that of\nother classical T Tauri stars reported in the literature, displaying no strong\nemission features of water, acetylene, or HCN. The difference indicates that\nthe inner planet formation region (within 5 AU) of the gaseous disk has evolved\nphysically and/or chemically away from the classical T Tauri norm.\nNevertheless, TW Hya does show a rich spectrum of emission features of atoms\n(HI, [NeII], and [NeIII]) and molecules (H2, OH, CO2, HCO+, and possibly CH3),\nsome of which are also detected in classical T Tauri spectra.

While the absence of strong molecular emission in the 10-20\nmicron region may indicate that the inner region of the gaseous disk has been\npartly cleared by an orbiting giant planet, chemical and/or excitation effects\nmay be responsible instead.

We focus on the calculation of the\ncritical temperature, the upper critical field, and the spin susceptibility. It\nis shown that the impurity effects on the critical temperature are similar to\nthose in multi-band centrosymmetric superconductors, in particular, Anderson's\ntheorem holds for isotropic singlet pairing. In contrast, scalar impurities\naffect the spin susceptibility in the same way as spin-orbit impurities do in\ncentrosymmetric superconductors. Another peculiar feature is that in the\nabsence of inversion symmetry scalar disorder can mix singlet and triplet\npairing channels. This leads to significant deviations of the upper critical\nfield from the predictions of the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory in the\nconventional centrosymmetric case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 21:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-26"}

The model induces a\nsimply-connected but possibly multi-component bipartite graph. A trading\nsession on a fixed graph consists of a sequence of exchanges between connected\nbuyers and sellers until no more exchanges are possible. We deem a trading\nsession \"feasible\" if all of the buyers satisfy their respective demands. If\nall trading sessions are feasible the graph is deemed \"successful\", otherwise\nthe feasibility of a trading session depends on the order of the sequence of\nexchanges. We demonstrate that topology is important for the success of trading\nsessions on graphs. In particular, for the case that supply equals demand for\neach component of the graph, we prove that the graph is successful if and only\nif the graph consists of components each of which are complete bipartite. For\nthe case that supply exceeds demand, we prove that the other topologies also\ncan be made successful but with finite reserve (i.e., excess supply)\nrequirements that may grow proportional to the number of buyers. Finally, with\ncomputations for a small instance of the model, we provide an example of the\nwide range of performance in which only the connectivity varies. These results\ntaken together place limits on the improvements in performance that can be\nexpected from proposals to increase the connectivity of sparse exchange\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 21:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-26"}

The resulting\nbound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD leads to relativistic\nlight-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable $\\zeta$\nwhich measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the\nhadron at equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical\nspace-time are equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the\npropagation of spin-$J$ modes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. The eigenvalues\ngive the hadronic spectrum, and the eigenmodes represent the probability\ndistributions of the hadronic constituents at a given scale. A positive-sign\nconfining dilaton background modifying AdS space gives a very good account of\nmeson and baryon spectroscopy and form factors. The light-front holographic\nmapping of this model also leads to a non-perturbative effective coupling\n$\\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q^2)$ which agrees with the effective charge defined by the\nBjorken sum rule and lattice simulations. It displays a transition from\nperturbative to nonperturbative conformal regimes at a momentum scale $ \\sim 1$\nGeV.

However, it seems that things are no longer so clear cut. In this\nwork, we present the results of detailed dynamical simulations of the orbital\nbehaviour of 2001 QR322. Using an ephemeris for the object that has\nsignificantly improved since earlier works, we follow the evolution of 19683\ntest particles, placed on orbits within the observational error ellipse of 2001\nQR322's orbit, for a period of 1 Gyr. We find that majority of these \"clones\"\nof 2001 QR322 are dynamically unstable, exhibiting a near-exponential decay\nfrom both the Neptunian Trojan cloud (decay halflife ~550 Myr) and the Solar\nsystem (decay halflife ~590 Myr). The stability of the object within Neptune's\nTrojan cloud is found to be strongly dependent on the initial semi-major axis\nused, with those objects located at semimajor axis equal or greater than 30.30\nAU being significantly less stable than those interior to this value, as a\nresult of their having initial libration amplitudes very close to a critical\nthreshold dividing regular and irregular motion, located at ~70-75 deg (full\nextent of angular motion). This result suggests that, if 2001 QR322 is a\nprimordial Neptunian Trojan, it must be a representative of a population that\nwas once significantly larger than that we see today, and adds weight to the\nidea that the Neptune Trojans may represent a significant source of objects\nmoving on unstable orbits between the giant planets (the Centaurs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 07:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 15:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-16"}

The jet boundary becomes, under certain\nconditions, unstable relative to magnetosonic oscillations (Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability) in the presence of a shear flow at the jet boundary. Because of\nits internal inhomogeneity the plasma jet has resonance surfaces, where\nconversion takes place between various modes of plasma MHD oscillations.\nPropagating in inhomogeneous plasma, fast magnetosonic waves drive the Alfven\nand slow magnetosonic oscillations, tightly localized across the magnetic\nshells, on the resonance surfaces. MHD oscillation energy is absorbed in the\nneighbourhood of these resonance surfaces. The resonance surfaces disappear for\nthe eigen-modes of slow magnetosonic waves propagating in the jet waveguide.\nThe stability of the plasma MHD flow is determined by competition between the\nmechanisms of shear flow instability on the boundary and wave energy\ndissipation because of resonant MHD-mode coupling. The problem is solved\nanalytically, in the WKB approximation, for the plasma jet with a boundary in\nthe form of a tangential discontinuity over the radial coordinate. The\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability develops if plasma flow velocity in the jet\nexceeds the maximum Alfven speed at the boundary. The stability of the plasma\njet with a smooth boundary layer is investigated numerically for the basic\nmodes of MHD oscillations, to which the WKB approximation is inapplicable. A\nnew \"global\" unstable mode of MHD oscillations has been discovered which,\nunlike the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, exists for any, however weak, plasma\nflow velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 07:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The analysis is done by measuring the position of the\nfine structure lines of the [OIII] doublet (4959 and 5008) in QSO nebular\nemission. From the sample of QSOs at redshifts z < 0.8 a subsample was selected\non the basis of the amplitude and width of the [OIII] lines. Two different\nmethod were used to determine the position of the lines of the [OIII] doublet,\nboth giving similar results. Using a clean sample containing 1568 of such\nspectra, a value of Delta alpha /alpha=(+2.4 +-2.5) x 10^{-5} (in the range of\nredshifts 0-0.8) was determined. The use of a larger number of spectra allows a\nfactor ~5 improvement on previous constraints based on the same method. On the\nwhole, we find no evidence of changes in alpha on such cosmological timescales.\nThe mean variation compatible with our results is 1/ <t> Delta\nalpha/alpha=(+0.7 +- 0.7) x 10^{-14} yr^{-1}. The analysis was extended to the\n[NeIII] and [SII] doublets, although their usefulness is limited due to the\nfact that all these doublets in QSOs tend to be fainter than [OIII], and that\nsome of them are affected by systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 12:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Using the data of ARGO-YBJ, a full coverage air shower detector\nlocated at Yangbajing (4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, China), we monitored the source at\ngamma ray energies E > 0.3 TeV during the whole year. The observed flux was\nvariable, with the strongest flares in March and June, in correlation with\nX-ray enhanced activity. While during specific episodes the TeV flux could be\nseveral times larger than the Crab Nebula one, the average emission from day 41\nto 180 was almost twice the Crab level, with an integral flux of (3.6 +-0.6)\n10^-11 photons cm^-2 s^-1 for energies E > 1 TeV, and decreased afterwards.\n  This paper concentrates on the flares occurred in the first half of June.\nThis period has been deeply studied from optical to 100 MeV gamma rays, and\npartially up to TeV energies, since the moonlight hampered the Cherenkov\ntelescope observations during the most intense part of the emission. Our data\ncomplete these observations, with the detection of a signal with a statistical\nsignificance of 3.8 standard deviations on June 11-13, corresponding to a gamma\nray flux about 6 times larger than the Crab one above 1 TeV. The reconstructed\ndifferential spectrum, corrected for the intergalactic absorption, can be\nrepresented by a power law with an index alpha = -2.1 extending up to several\nTeV. The spectrum slope is fully consistent with previous observations\nreporting a correlation between the flux and the spectral index, suggesting\nthat this property is maintained in different epochs and characterizes the\nsource emission processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 12:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The spectrum of the latter follows the sequence of\nflavour-symmetry breaking related to the hierarchies in Yukawa couplings and\nflavour mixing angles. (ii) Gauge anomalies can be consistently treated by\nadding higher-dimensional operators. (iii) Leaving the U(1) factors of the\nflavour symmetry group as global symmetries, the respective Goldstone modes\nbehave as axions which can be used to resolve the strong CP problem by a\nmodified Peccei-Quinn mechanism.
