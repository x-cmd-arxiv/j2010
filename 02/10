Our simulation set includes star formation and accretion onto the\nMBHs, as well as feedback from both processes. We consider 1:10 merger events\nstarting at z~3, with MBH masses in the sensitivity window of the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna, and we follow the coupling between the merger\ndynamics and the evolution of the MBH mass ratio until the satellite galaxy is\ntidally disrupted. While the more massive MBH accretes in most cases as if the\ngalaxy were in isolation, the satellite MBH may undergo distinct episodes of\nenhanced accretion, owing to strong tidal torques acting on its host galaxy and\nto orbital circularization inside the disk of the primary galaxy. As a\nconsequence, the initial 1:10 mass ratio of the MBHs changes by the time the\nsatellite is disrupted. Depending on the initial fraction of cold gas in the\ngalactic disks and the geometry of the encounter, the mass ratios of the MBH\npairs at the time of satellite disruption can stay unchanged or become as large\nas 1:2. Remarkably, the efficiency of MBH orbital decay correlates with the\nfinal mass ratio of the pair itself: MBH pairs that increase significantly\ntheir mass ratio are also expected to inspiral more promptly down to\nnuclear-scale separations. These findings indicate that the mass ratios of MBH\npairs in galactic nuclei do not necessarily trace the mass ratios of their\nmerging host galaxies, but are determined by the complex interplay between gas\naccretion and merger dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 20:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 14:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 May 2011 10:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-11"}

The generalized fluid obeys an inhomogeneous equation of state.\nA viscous dark fluid is included, and we include also modified gravity using\nits fluid representation. It is demonstrated how such an expression reduces to\nthe standard Cardy-Verlinde formula corresponding to the 2d CFT entropy only in\nsome special cases. The dynamical entropy bound for a closed FRW universe with\ndark components is obtained. The universality of the dynamical entropy bound\nnear a future singularity (of all four types), as well as near the Big Bang\nsingularity, is investigated. It is demonstrated that except from some special\ncases of Type II and Type IV singularities the dynamical entropy bound is\nviolated near the singularity even if quantum effects are taken into account.\nThe dynamical entropy bound seems to be universal for the case of a regular\nuniverse, including the asymptotic de Sitter one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 19:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 10:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

Several examples exist in the Milky\nWay Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst\nand interacting galaxies. The few young massive clusters that are close enough\nto resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the\necological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The\ndistant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster\nmass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation\nmechanisms of young cluster populations. Young massive clusters are expected to\nbe the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic\nstars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in young\nmassive clusters, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are\nunusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review we focus on star clusters\nyounger than $\\sim100$ Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and\nmore massive than $\\sim10^4$ \\Msun, irrespective of cluster size or\nenvironment. We describe the global properties of the currently known young\nmassive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of\nthe art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to\nmake this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational\nastrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 21:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The evolution of a bidisperse mixture of\nparticles can be modeled by a nonlinear first order partial differential\nequation, provided the shear (or velocity) is a known function of position.\nWhile avalanche-driven shear is approximately uniform in depth, boundary-driven\nshear typically creates a shear band with a nonlinear velocity profile. In this\npaper, we measure a velocity profile from experimental data and solve initial\nvalue problems that mimic the segregation observed in the experiment, thereby\nverifying the value of the continuum model. To simplify the analysis, we\nconsider only one-dimensional configurations, in which a layer of small\nparticles is placed above a layer of large particles within an annular shear\ncell and is sheared for arbitrarily long times. We fit the measured velocity\nprofile to both an exponential function of depth and a piecewise linear\nfunction which separates the shear band from the rest of the material.

The scheme uses the Fourier transform to reduce the original BIE\ndefined on a surface to a sequence of BIEs defined on a generating curve for\nthe surface. It can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally\nsymmetric. Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the\ngenerating curve. The quadrature used is a high-order Gaussian rule that is\nmodified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels.\nThe reduction in dimensionality, along with the use of high-order accurate\nquadratures, leads to small linear systems that can be inverted directly via,\ne.g., Gaussian elimination. This makes the scheme particularly fast in\nenvironments involving multiple right hand sides. It is demonstrated that for\nBIEs associated with Laplace's equation, the kernel in the reduced equations\ncan be evaluated very rapidly by exploiting recursion relations for Legendre\nfunctions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the scheme; in\nparticular, it is demonstrated that for a BIE associated with Laplace's\nequation on a surface discretized using 320 000 points, the set-up phase of the\nalgorithm takes 2 minutes on a standard desktop, and then solves can be\nexecuted in 0.5 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 23:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-11"}

The GU Boo light curves presented in\nLR05 had substantial asymmetries, which were attributed to large spots. In\nspite of the asymmetry LR05 derived masses and radii accurate to about 2%. We\nobtained additional photometry of GU Boo using both a CCD and a single-channel\nphotometer and modeled the light curves with the ELC software to determine if\nthe large spots in the light curves give rise to systematic errors at the few\npercent level. We also modeled the original light curves from LR05 using models\nwith and without spots. We derived a radius of the primary of 0.6329 +- 0.0026\nSolar-Radii, 0.6413 +- 0.0049 SR, and 0.6373 +- 0.0029 SR from the CCD,\nphotoelectric, and LR05 data, respectively. Each of these measurements agrees\nwith the value reported by LR05 (R1=0.623 +- 0.016 SR) at the level of about\n2%. In addition, the spread in these values is about 1-2% from the mean.

CO J=3-2 maps have been secured along\nthe north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as L 1495, along with deep\n13CO and C18O J=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. With these data we search for\nmolecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, HH objects and shocked\nH2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,\nprotostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across this\nextensive region. In total 21 outflows are identified. It is clear that the\nbowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of T Tauri\nstars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. By comparison, the\nridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostars\nwhich, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. We\nestimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in L 1495\nto be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to\n(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. If we take previous\nestimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates a\nprestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. From the number of outflows we also\ncrudely estimate the star formation efficiency in L 1495, finding it to be\ncompatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. We note that molecular\noutflow-driving sources have redder near-IR colours than their HH jet-driving\ncounterparts. We also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated with\nthe more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flow\nincreases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 02:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

With only\nmoderate assumptions, it is shown that the Trojans can contribute a significant\nproportion of the Centaur population, and may even be the dominant source\nreservoir.

The cluster formation was\nmonitored using different formulation pathways, including direct mixing,\ndialysis, dilution and quenching. In the first process, the hybrids were\nobtained by mixing stock solutions of polymers and nanoparticles. Dialysis and\ndilution were based on controlled desalting kinetics according to methods\ndeveloped in molecular biology. The fourth process consisted in a rapid\ndilution of the salted dispersions and as such it was regarded as a quench of\nthe cluster kinetics.

With\ndecreasing IS, the electrostatically screened polymers and nanoparticles system\nundergo an abrupt transition between an unassociated and a clustered state. By\ntuning the desalting kinetics, the size of the clusters was varied from 100 nm\nto over 1 micrometer. At low ionic strength, the clusters were found to be\nkinetically frozen.

We compare our results with the corresponding results for\nminimally coupled quintessence perturbations. Our results for natural (O(1))\nvalues of parameters in the Lagrangian which lead to a background expansion\nsimilar to LCDM are summarized as follows: 1. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density\nperturbations are amplified by a factor of about 10^6 compared to minimally\ncoupled quintessence perturbations on scales less than about 100 h^{-1} Mpc. On\nthese scales dark energy perturbations constitute a fraction of about 10%\ncompared to matter density perturbations. 2. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density\nperturbations are anti-correlated with matter linear perturbations on\nsub-Hubble scales. Thus clusters of galaxies are predicted to overlap with\nvoids of dark energy. 3. This anti-correlation of matter with negative pressure\nperturbations induces a mild amplification of matter perturbations by about 10%\non sub-Hubble scales. 4. The evolution of scalar field perturbations on\nsub-Hubble scales, is scale independent and therefore it corresponds to a\nvanishing effective speed of sound (c_{s\\Phi}=0). It also involves large\noscillations at early times induced by the amplified effective mass of the\nfield. This amplification is due to the non-minimal coupling of the field to\nthe Ricci curvature scalar and (thus) to matter. No such oscillations are\npresent in minimally coupled quintessence perturbations which are suppressed on\nsub-Hubble scales (c_{s\\Phi}=1). Implications of our results include modified\npredictions for cluster halo profiles observed properties. These profiles are\nknown to be in some tension with the predictions of LCDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 08:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 18:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

The main aim of these monitoring observations is to study spectral\nvariabilities in the Be disc, on both the short (a week or so) and long (more\nthan hundreds of days) timescales, by taking long-term frequent observations.\nOur four-year spectroscopic observations indicate that the V/R ratio, i.e., the\nrelative intensity of the violet (V) peak to the red (R) one, of the\ndouble-peaked H-alpha line profile varies with a period of 500 days. The H-beta\nline profile also varies in phase with the H-alpha profile. With these\nobservations covering two full cycles of the V/R variability, we reconstruct\nthe 2-D structure of the Be disc by applying the Doppler tomography method to\nthe H-alpha and H-beta emission line profiles, using a rigidly rotating frame\nwith the V/R variability period. The resulting disc structure reveals\nnon-axisymmetric features, which can be explained by a one-armed perturbation\nin the Be disc. It is the first time that an eccentric disc structure is\ndirectly detected by using a method other than the interferometric one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 10:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 06:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Numerical\nsimulations suggest that the first stars were predominantly very massive, with\ntypical masses M > 100 Mo.

In this work, we study the\nstructure of Zero Age Main Sequence stars for a wide mass and metallicity range\nand the evolution of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 Mo galactic and pregalactic Pop\nIII very massive stars without mass loss, with metallicity Z=10E-6 and 10E-9,\nrespectively. Using a stellar evolution code, a system of 10 equations together\nwith boundary conditions are solved simultaneously. For the change of chemical\ncomposition, which determines the evolution of a star, a diffusion treatment\nfor convection and semiconvection is used. A set of 30 nuclear reactions are\nsolved simultaneously with the stellar structure and evolution equations.\nSeveral results on the main sequence, and during the hydrogen and helium\nburning phases, are described. Low metallicity massive stars are hotter and\nmore compact and luminous than their metal enriched counterparts. Due to their\nhigh temperatures, pregalactic stars activate sooner the triple alpha reaction\nself-producing their own heavy elements. Both galactic and pregalactic stars\nare radiation pressure dominated and evolve below the Eddington luminosity\nlimit with short lifetimes.
