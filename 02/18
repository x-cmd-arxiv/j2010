Since the cross section is defined through final states containing the\ntop decay products, a consistent definition of the cross section depends on\nprescriptions how these final states are accounted for the cross section.\nExperimentally, these prescriptions are implemented for example through cuts on\nkinematic quantities such as the reconstructed top quark invariant masses. As\nlong as these cuts do not reject final states that can arise from the decay of\na top and an anti-top quark with a small off-shellness compatible with the\nnonrelativistic power-counting, they can be implemented through imaginary phase\nspace matching conditions in NRQCD. The prescription-dependent cross section\ncan then be determined from the optical theorem using the $e^+e^-$ forward\nscattering amplitude. We compute the phase space matching conditions associated\nto cuts on the top and anti-top invariant masses at next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic (NNLL) order and partially at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic (N${}^3$LL) order in the nonrelativistic expansion and, together\nwith finite lifetime and electroweak effects known from previous work, analyze\ntheir numerical impact on the $t\\bar t$ cross section.

We address the problem of\nopportunistic multiuser scheduling under imperfect channel state information,\nby exploiting the memory inherent in the channel. In our setting, the channel\nbetween the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chain\nand the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at the\nscheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. The\nscheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback\nand uses this information to make scheduling decisions. We formulate a\nthroughput maximization problem as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP). For the case of two users in the system, we show that a greedy\npolicy is sum throughput optimal for any distribution on the ARQ feedback\ndelay. For the case of more than two users, we prove that the greedy policy is\nsuboptimal and demonstrate, via numerical studies, that it has near optimal\nperformance. We show that the greedy policy can be implemented by a simple\nalgorithm that does not require the statistics of the underlying Markov channel\nor the ARQ feedback delay, thus making it robust against errors in system\nparameter estimation. Establishing an equivalence between the two-user system\nand a genie-aided system, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the sum\ncapacity of the Markov-modeled downlink.

Two very\ndifferent results have been found recently for the age distribution chi(t) of\nclusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We found that chi(t) can be\ndescribed approximately by a power law chi(t) propto t^{gamma}, with gamma\n-0.8, by counting clusters in the mass-age plane, i.e., by constructing chi(t)\ndirectly from mass-limited samples.

From the colors and luminosities of the young star clusters, we find\nthat the galaxies in HCG 31 follow the same universal scaling relations as\nactively star-forming galaxies in the local Universe despite the unusual\ncompact group environment. Furthermore, the specific frequency of the globular\ncluster system is consistent with the low end of galaxies of comparable masses\nlocally. This, combined with the large mass of neutral hydrogen and tight\nconstraints on the amount of intragroup light, indicate that the group is\nundergoing its first epoch of interaction-induced star formation. In both the\nmain galaxies and the tidal-dwarf candidate, F, stellar complexes, which are\nsensitive to the magnitude of disk turbulence, have both sizes and masses more\ncharacteristic of z=1-2 galaxies.

We find this is no longer true when the medium\nis a magnetized plasma.

Our simulations cover the halo mass\nrange of M_h = 10^9 - 10^12 M_sun. We postprocess several hundred simulated\ngalaxies with the Authentic Radiative Transfer (ART) code to study the halo\nmass dependence of f_esc. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the transfer\nof stellar radiation from local stellar population in each dark matter halo. We\nfind that the average f_esc steeply decreases as the halo mass increases, with\na large scatter for the lower mass haloes. The low mass haloes with M_h ~ 10^9\nM_sun have large values of f_esc (with an average of ~ 0.4), whereas the\nmassive haloes with M_h ~ 10^11 M_sun show small values of f_esc (with an\naverage of ~ 0.07). This is because in our simulations, the massive haloes show\nmore clumpy structure in gas distribution, and star-forming regions are\nembedded inside these clumps, making it more difficult for the ionizing photons\nto escape. On the other hand, in low mass haloes, there are often conical\nregions of highly ionized gas due to the shifted location of young star\nclusters from the center of dark matter halo, which allows the ionizing photons\nto escape more easily than in the high-mass haloes. By counting the number of\nescaped ionizing photons, we show that the star-forming galaxies can ionize the\nintergalactic medium at z=3-6. The main contributor to the ionizing photons is\nthe haloes with M_h < 10^10 M_sun owing to their high f_esc. The large\ndispersion in f_esc suggests that there may be various sizes of H{\\sc ii}\nbubbles around the haloes even with the same mass in the early stages of\nreionization.

The X-ray signatures of these two possible paths are\nvery different.

We conclude that no more than ~5 per cent of Type Ia supernovae\nin early type galaxies can be produced by white dwarfs in accreting binary\nsystems, unless their progenitors are much younger than the bulk of the stellar\npopulation in these galaxies, or explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs\nmake a significant contribution to the supernova rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 20:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

They\nare associated with chaotic behavior, since bifurcation diagrams of a map with\na parameter often reveal a complicated intermingling of period-doubling\ncascades and chaos. Period doubling can be studied at three levels of\ncomplexity. The first is an individual period-doubling bifurcation. The second\nis an infinite collection of period doublings that are connected together by\nperiodic orbits in a pattern called a cascade. It was first described by\nMyrberg and later in more detail by Feigenbaum. The third involves infinitely\nmany cascades and a parameter value $\\mu_2$ of the map at which there is chaos.\nWe show that often virtually all (i.e., all but finitely many) ``regular''\nperiodic orbits at $\\mu_2$ are each connected to exactly one cascade by a path\nof regular periodic orbits; and virtually all cascades are either paired --\nconnected to exactly one other cascade, or solitary -- connected to exactly one\nregular periodic orbit at $\\mu_2$. The solitary cascades are robust to large\nperturbations. Hence the investigation of infinitely many cascades is\nessentially reduced to studying the regular periodic orbits of $F(\\mu_2,\n\\cdot)$. Examples discussed include the forced-damped pendulum and the\ndouble-well Duffing equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 20:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-18"}

During the process\nof merging, the orbital angular momentum is redistributed into the internal\nangular momentum of the final system; the internal angular momentum of the\nprimary galaxy can increase or decrease depending on the relative orientation\nof the orbital spin vectors (direct or retrograde), while the initially\nnon-rotating dark matter halo always gains angular momentum.

Our models assume cosmologically-motivated\ninitial conditions where dSphs are DM-dominated systems on eccentric orbits\nabout a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. We find that\nthe resilience of dSphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the halo\ncuspiness; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by the\nhost disc, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant. For a given halo\nprofile the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides is\ncontrolled solely by the total amount of mass lost. This information is used to\nconstruct a semi-analytic code that simulates the hierarchical build-up of\nspiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. We find that\ntidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellites at\nall galactocentric radii. Interestingly, satellites accreted before\nre-ionization (z>6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicity\npatterns, survive only if haloes are cuspy.

GRB 090510, a short burst, is\nparticularly interesting because the good timing allows to derive a severe\nlimit to theories of quantum gravity. With the dozen bursts detected in the\n0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the\nduration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by\nthe Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent\nwith F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest\nbursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical\nslope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest\nframe). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV\nflux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following\nthe start of the prompt phase. The steep decay slope suggests that the fireball\nemits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. The\nlarge peak energy of the GBM flux suggests that electron-positron pairs might\nplay a crucial role. The rapid onset, but with some delay, of the GeV flux with\nrespect to the GBM one suggests that the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of these\nbursts is of the order of 1000. Therefore the relatively small fraction of\nbursts detected at high energies might correspond to the fraction of bursts\nhaving the largest Gamma.

This in turn is reflected in the predicted size-mass\nrelation, much flatter than the observed one, due to too large (~3 kpc)\nlow-mass galaxies (<10^11 \\msun), and to a non-negligible fraction of compact\n(< 0.5-1 kpc) and massive galaxies (> 10^11 \\msun).

It reduces to the later one in the\nstatic case if the rotation goes to zero. The original Curzon solution shows\nthat there are two singularities at the two masses, while in the modified\nversion the singularities become on the world-line of the two masses.

The temporal evolution of the well-separated multi-soliton structures is\ndescribed by a weakly coupled lattice dynamical system (LDS) for the\ncoordinates and phases of the solitons.

We have studied the changes of the\nRadial Distribution Function (RDF) as a function of density in the coexistence\nregion. We started our simulations from crystalline states with densities above\nthe melting point, and moved down to densities in the liquid state below the\nfreezing point. For all the examined dimensions (including D = 3) it was\nobserved that the height of the first minimum of the RDF changes in an almost\ncontinuous way around the freezing density and resembles a second order phase\ntransition. With these results we propose a numerical method to estimate the\nfreezing point as a function of the dimension D using numerical fits and\nsemiempirical approaches. We find that the estimated values of the freezing\npoint are very close to previously reported values from simulations and\ntheoretical approaches up to D = 6 reinforcing the validity of the proposed\nmethod. This was also applied to numerical simulations for D = 7 giving new\nestimations of the freezing point for this dimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 23:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 17:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 15:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Unlike previous studies, the averaging is exact,\nnon-perturbative, and includes all possible non-linear effects. The\ninhomogeneous universes are represented by Sweese-cheese models containing\nrandom and simple cubic lattices of mass-compensated voids. The Earth observer\nis in the homogeneous cheese which has an Einstein - de Sitter metric. For the\nfirst time, the averaging is widened to include the supernovas inside the voids\nby assuming the probability for supernova emission from any comoving volume is\nproportional to the rest mass in it. Despite the well known argument for photon\nflux conservation, the average distance modulus correction at low redshifts is\nnot zero due to the peculiar velocities. A formula for the maximum possible\naverage correction as a function of redshift is derived and shown to be in\nexcellent agreement with the numerical results. The actual average correction\ncalculated in random and simple cubic void lattices is severely damped below\nthe predicted maximal average. That is traced to cancelations between the\ncorrections coming from the fronts and backs of different voids at the same\nredshift from the observer. The calculated correction at low redshifts allows\none to readily predict the redshift at which the averaged fluctuation in the\nHubble diagram is below a required precision and suggests a method to extract\nthe background Hubble constant from low redshift data without the need to\ncorrect for peculiar velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 00:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-19"}

Our new observations, along with\nprevious literature results, span a wide range of orbital period and CV type.\nIn general, dwarf novae in which the secondary star is seen show weak to no CO\nabsorption while polar and pre-CV donor stars appear to have normal CO\nabsorption for their spectral type. However, this is not universal. The\npresence of normal looking CO absorption in the dwarf nova SS Aur and the\nhibernating CV QS Vir and a complete lack of CO absorption in the long period\npolar V1309 Ori cloud the issue. A summary of the literature pointing to\nnon-solar abundances including enhanced NV/CIV ratios is presented. It appears\nthat some CVs have non-solar abundance material accreting onto the white dwarf\nsuggesting an evolved secondary star while for others CO emission in the\naccretion disk may play a role.

One recurring apparent difficulty with this\nprogram has been that some of the primary observational quantities to be fit as\n\"data\" - the isotropic-equivalent prompt energy $E_{iso}$ and the\ncollimation-corrected \"total\" prompt energy energy $E_{\\gamma}$ - depend for\ntheir construction on the very cosmological models that they are supposed to\nhelp constrain. This is the so-called \"circularity problem\" of standard candle\nGRBs. This paper is intended to point out that the circularity problem is not\nin fact a problem at all, except to the extent that it amounts to a\nself-inflicted wound. It arises essentially because of an unfortunate choice of\ndata variables, such as $E_{iso}$, which are unnecessarily model-dependent. If,\ninstead, the empirical correlations of GRB phenomenology which are formulated\nin source-variables are {\\it mapped to the primitive observational variables}\n(such as fluence) and compared to the observations in that space, then all\ncircularity disappears. I also indicate here a set of procedures for encoding\nhigh-dimensional empirical correlations in a \"Gaussian Tube\" smeared model that\nincludes both the correlation and its intrinsic scatter, and how that\nsource-variable model may easily be mapped to the space of primitive\nobservables and fashioned into a likelihood. I discuss the projections of such\nGaussian tubes into sub-spaces, which may be used to incorporate data from GRB\nevents that may lack some element of the data (for example, GRBs without\nascertained jet-break times). In this way, a large set of inhomogeneously\nobserved GRBs may be assimilated into a single analysis, so long as each\npossesses at least two correlated data attributes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 07:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 18:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-16"}

The stellar parameters\nwere significantly constrained, but the behavior of one of the seismic indexes\n(the small spacing d01) could not be fitted with the observed one, even with\nthe best considered models. We study the possibility of improving the agreement\nbetween models and observations by changing the physical properties of the\ninner parts of the star (to which d01 is sensitive). We show that, in spite of\nits low mass, it is possible to produce models of HD 203608 with a convective\ncore. No such model was considered in the preliminary modeling. In practice, we\nobtain these models here by assuming some extra mixing at the edge of the early\nconvective core. We optimize the model parameters using the Levenberg-Marquardt\nalgorithm. The agreement between the new best model with a convective core and\nthe observations is much better than for the models without. All the\nobservational parameters are fitted within 1-sigma observational error bars.\nThis is the first observational evidence of a convective core in an old and\nlow-mass star such as HD 203608. In standard models of low-mass stars, the core\nwithdraws shortly after the ZAMS. The survival of the core until the present\nage of HD 203608 provides very strong constraints on the size of the mixed zone\nassociated to the convective core. Using overshooting as a proxy to model the\nprocesses of transport at the edge of the core, we find that to reproduce both\nglobal and seismic observations, we must have alpha_ov = 0.17 +/- 0.03 Hp for\nHD 203608.

Using a\npopulation model, we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced with\na self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between\n15-120AU. Disks must have this 15AU minimum radius to show a peak in disk\nfraction, rather than a monotonic decline. Populations of extended disks with\nfixed inner and/or outer radii fail to fit the statistics, due mainly to the\nslow 70um evolution as stirring moves further out in the disk. This conclusion,\nthat debris disks are narrow belts, is independent of the significance of 24um\ntrends for young A-stars. We show that the statistics can also be reproduced\nwith a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearby\neccentric planet. Detailed imaging is therefore the best way to characterise\nthe stirring mechanism. From a more detailed look at beta Pictoris Moving Group\nand TW Hydrae Association A-stars we find that the disk around beta Pictoris is\nlikely the result of secular stirring by the proposed planet at ~10AU; the\nstructure of the HR 4796A disk also points to sculpting by a planet. The two\nother stars with disks, HR 7012 and eta Tel, possess transient hot dust, though\nthe outer eta Tel disk is consistent with a self-stirred origin. Planet\nformation provides a natural explanation for the belt-like nature of debris\ndisks, with inner regions cleared by planets that may also stir the disk, and\nthe outer edges set by where planetesimals can form.

For all these games, we also give almost tight upper and\nlower bounds on the mixing time of logit dynamics.

Using this selection criterion, subsamples of\nstar-forming galaxies have been extracted from catalogs of the MPA/JHU group.\nWe found that the galaxies of highest masses, those with masses > 10^11.2\nM_sun, have not been enriched in both oxygen and nitrogen over the last 3 Gyr:\nthey have formed their stars in the so distant past that these have returned\ntheir nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium before z=0.25.

This\nsuggests that stars with lifetimes of 2-3 Gyr contribute to the nitrogen\nproduction. Finally, galaxies with masses < 10^11 M_sun show enrichment in both\noxygen and nitrogen during the last 3 Gyr: they have undergone appreciable star\nformation and have converted up to 20% of their mass into stars over this\nperiod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 10:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Finally, a\ndeep observation of the field of SGR 0418+5729 with the new Gran Telescopio\nCanarias 10.4-m telescope allowed us to set an upper limit on the source\noptical flux of i'>25.1 mag, corresponding to an X-ray-to-optical flux ratio\nexceeding 10000, consistent with the characteristics of other magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 12:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

We present evidence that parsec-scale jets in BL Lac objects may be\nsignificantly distinct in kinematics from their counterparts in quasars.

Aims. A\ndetailed study of the jet components' motion reveals that the standard AGN\nparadigm of apparent superluminal motion does not always describe the\nkinematics in BL Lac objects. We study 0735+178 here to augment and improve the\nunderstanding of the peculiar motions in the jets of BL Lac objects as a class.\nMethods. We analyzed 15 GHz VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) observations\n(2cm/MOJAVE survey) performed at 23 epochs between 1995.27 and 2008.91.\nResults. We found a drastic structural mode change in the VLBI jet of 0735+178,\nbetween 2000.4 and 2001.8 when its twice sharply bent trajectory turned into a\nlinear shape.We further found that this jet had undergone a similar transition\nsometime between December 1981 and June 1983. A mode change, occurring in the\nreverse direction (between mid-1992 and mid-1995) has already been reported in\nthe literature. These structural mode changes are found to be reflected in\nchanged kinematical behavior of the nuclear jet, manifested as an apparent\nsuperluminal motion and stationarity of the radio knots. In addition, we found\nthe individual mode changes to correlate in time with the maxima in the optical\nlight curve. The last two transitions occurred before a (modest) radio flare.\nThe behavior of this pc-scale jet appears to favor a scenario involving\nnon-ballistic motions of the radio knots, produced by the precession of a\ncontinuous jet within the ambient medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 14:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We have tested it directly through\nsemi-analytical modelling, by studying how the massive early-type galaxies with\nlog(M_*/Msun)>11 at z~0 (mETGs) would have evolved backwards-in-time, under the\nhypothesis that each major merger gives place to an early-type galaxy. The\nstudy was carried out just considering the major mergers strictly reported by\nobservations at each redshift, and assuming that gas-rich major mergers\nexperience transitory phases of dust-reddened, star-forming galaxies (DSFs).\nThe model is able to reproduce the observed evolution of the galaxy LFs at\nz<~1, simultaneously for different rest-frame bands (B, I, and K) and for\ndifferent selection criteria on color and morphology. It also provides a\nframework in which apparently-contradictory results on the recent evolution of\nthe luminosity function (LF) of massive, red galaxies can be reconciled, just\nconsidering that observational samples of red galaxies can be significantly\ncontaminated by DSFs. The model proves that it is feasible to build up ~50-60%\nof the present-day mETG population at z<~1 and to reproduce the observational\nexcess by a factor of ~4-5 of late-type galaxies at 0.8<z<1 through the\ncoordinated action of wet, mixed, and dry major mergers, fulfilling global\ntrends that are in general agreement with mass-downsizing. The bulk of this\nassembly takes place during ~1 Gyr elapsed at 0.8<z<1.

The suspension is made\nof insulating particles (PMMA) dispersed in a slightly conducting oil (Ugilec +\nDielec) and is subjected to a DC electric field. In such a case, the particles\nare polarized in the direction opposite to that of the electric field and begin\nto rotate in order to flip their dipoles in the field direction. Such a\nrotation of the particles is known as Quincke rotation and is responsible for\nan important decrease of the effective viscosity of the suspension. Indeed, due\nto the electric torque exerted on the particles, the stress tensor in the\nsuspension is not symmetric anymore and a driving effect arises from the\nanti-symmetric part. When such a suspension flows through a rectangular\nchannel, the velocity profile is expected to deviate from the usual Poiseuille\nflow. In this paper, the velocity profiles are measured using Pulsed Ultrasound\nDoppler Velocimetry technique. They compare well with those that are computed\nfrom the otherwise measured rheological law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 15:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 11:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-19"}
