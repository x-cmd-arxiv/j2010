It is\nwell established that they are not \"in situ\" formation objects, around the\nplanet, as are believed to be the regular ones. Then, the most plausible\nhypothesis to explain their origins is that they formed elsewhere and were\ncaptured by the planet. However, captures under restricted three-body problem\ndynamics have temporary feature, which makes necessary the action of an\nauxiliary capture mechanism. Nevertheless, there not exist one well established\ncapture mechanism. In this work, we tried to understand which aspects of a\nbinary-asteroid capture mechanism could favor the permanent capture of one\nmember of a binary asteroid. We performed more than eight thousand numerical\nsimulations of capture trajectories considering the four-body dynamical system\nSun, Jupiter, Binary-asteroid. We restricted the problem to the circular planar\nprograde case, and time of integration to 10^4 years. With respect to the\nbinary features, we noted that 1) tighter binaries are much more susceptible to\nproduce permanent captures than the large separation-ones. We also found that\n2) the permanent capture probability of the minor member of the binary is much\nmore expressive than the major body permanent capture probability. On the other\nhand, among the aspects of capture-disruption process, 4) a pseudo\neastern-quadrature was noted to be a very likely capture angular configuration\nat the instant of binary disruptions. In addition, we also found that the 5)\ncapture probability is higher for binary asteroids which disrupt in an\ninferior-conjunction with Jupiter. These results show that the Sun plays a very\nimportant role on the capture dynamic of binary asteroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 19:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This notion doesnt\nhold in wireless parts of the network. Wireless links are highly unreliable and\nthey lose segments all the time due to a number of factors. Very few papers are\navailable which uses TCP for MANET. In this paper, an attempt have been made to\njustify the use of TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) for loss of packet due to\nrandom noise introduces in the MANET. For the present analysis the simulation\nhas been carried out for TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) by introduces 0, 10, 20\nand 30 percent noise. The comparison of TCP variants is made by running\nsimulation for 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent of data packet loss due to noise in the\ntransmission link and the effect of throughput and congestion window has been\nexamined. During the simulation we have observed that throughput has been\ndecreased when a drop of multiple segments happens, further we have observed in\nthe case of TCP variant (Reno) throughput is better at 1 percent (Figure 5)\nwhich implies a network with short burst of error and low BER, causing only one\nsegment to be lost. When multiple segments are lost due to error prone nature\nof link, Tahoe perform better than Reno (Figure 13), that gives a significant\nsaving of time (64.28 percent) in comparison with Reno (Table 4). Several\nsimulations have been run with ns 2 simulator in order to acquire a better\nunderstanding of these TCP variants and the way they perform their function.

In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key\ncan be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum\nparticles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used\nby Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum\nmechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum\ncryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very\neavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both\npractical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on\noperational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -\nthat information gain about one bservables must cause disturbance to another,\nincompatible one?\n  Here we resolve this problem by using in place of non-locality another\nstriking feature of quantum world - contextuality.

The components\nA2alpha and A2beta recently detected in this system are still present, and have\nmoved roughly symmetrically away from source A2 at a projected velocity of\n30-80 km s-1.

Powerful bipolar\nejections have long been known to occur in low-mass young stars, but this is\n-to our knowledge-- the first time that such a dramatic one is observed from\nits very beginning. Under the reasonable assumption that the flux detected at\nradio wavelengths is optically thin free-free emission, one can estimate the\nmass of each ejecta to be of the order of 10^-8 Msun.

We find that the\nmaximally symmetric, d=2, Type II MSDS-vacuum, is in correspondence with the\nmaximal, N=8, d=4, gauged supergravity, where the supergravity gauging is\ninduced by the fluxes. This correspondence is extended to less symmetric cases\nwhere the initial MSDS symmetry is reduced by orbifolds. We also exhibit and\nanalyse thermal interpretations of some Euclidean versions of the models and\nidentify classes of MSDS vacua that remain tachyon-free under arbitrary\nmarginal deformations about the extended symmetry point. The connection between\nthe two-dimensional MSDS vacua and the resulting four-dimensional effective\nsupergravity theories arises naturally within the context of an adiabatic\ncosmological evolution, where the very early Universe is conjectured to be\ndescribed by an MSDS-vacuum, while at late cosmological times it is described\nby an effective N=1 supergravity theory with spontaneously broken\nsupersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 20:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 20:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 13:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-07"}

The 340 GHz continuum emission observed with the SMA and the\nphotometric data at lambda <= 70 micron are explained by a power-law disk model\nwhose outer radius and mass are 41 AU and (0.24 - 5.9) x 10^{-3} M_{sun},\nrespectively, if the exponent of dust mass opacity (beta) is assumed to be 0-2.\nThe disk model cannot fully reproduce the flux density at 230 GHz obtained with\nthe IRAM 30-meter telescope, suggesting that there is another extended \"halo\"\ncomponent that is missed in the SMA observations. By requiring the halo not to\nbe detected with the SMA, the lower limit to the size of the halo is evaluated\nto be between 174 AU and 574 AU, depending on the assumed beta value. The\nphysical nature of the halo is unclear, but it may be the periphery of a flared\ncircumstellar disk that is not described well in terms of a power-law disk\nmodel, or a remnant of a protostellar envelope having flattened structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 02:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 04:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this model, the\nvelocity field is a two-dimensional perturbation of a linear straining flow\nwith axial symmetry. The only free parameter is the Reynolds number $Re =\n\\Gamma/\\nu$, where $\\Gamma$ is the total circulation of the vortex and $\\nu$ is\nthe kinematic viscosity. The purpose of this paper is to show that Burgers\nvortex is asymptotically stable with respect to general three-dimensional\nperturbations, for all values of the Reynolds number. This definitive result\nsubsumes earlier studies by various authors, which were either restricted to\nsmall Reynolds numbers or to two-dimensional perturbations. Our proof relies on\nthe crucial observation that the linearized operator at Burgers vortex has a\nsimple and very specific dependence upon the axial variable. This allows to\nreduce the full linearized equations to a vectorial two-dimensional problem,\nwhich can be treated using an extension of the techniques developped in earlier\nworks. Although Burgers vortices are found to be stable for all Reynolds\nnumbers, the proof indicates that perturbations may undergo an important\ntransient amplification if $Re$ is large, a phenomenon that was indeed observed\nin numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 07:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We extend our previous\nanalysis to the three-year sample of 56 SNe Ia over the range 0.2<z<1.8, using\na Markov chain Monte Carlo to determine the best-fit unimodal delay-time\ndistribution function. The test, which ultimately compares the star formation\nrate density history to the unbinned volumetric SN Ia rate history from the\nGOODS/HST-SN survey, reveals a SN Ia delay-time distribution that is tightly\nconfined to 3-4 Gyrs (to >95% confidence). This result is difficult to resolve\nwith any intrinsic delay-time distribution function (bimodal or otherwise), in\nwhich a substantial fraction (e.g., >10%) of events are ``prompt'', requiring\nless than approximately 1 Gyr to develop from formation to explosion. The\nresult is, however, strongly motivated by the decline in the number of SNe Ia\nat z>1.2. Sub-samples of the HST-SN data confined to lower redshifts (z<1) show\nplausible delay-time distributions that are dominated by prompt events, which\nis more consistent with results from low-redshift supernova samples and\nsupernova host galaxy properties. Scenarios in which a substantial fraction of\nz>1.2 supernovae are extraordinarily obscured by dust may partly explain the\ndifferences in low-z and high-z results.

If the Poisson equation is used instead of the\nquasi-neutrality, however, the IA wave is damped and the damping is dispersive.\nIn a partially ionized plasma, the collisions with the neutrals modify the IA\nwave beyond recognition. For a low density of neutrals the mode is damped. Upon\nincreasing the neutral density, the mode becomes first evanescent and then\nreappears for a still larger number of neutrals. A similar behavior is obtained\nby varying the mode wave-length. The explanation for this behavior is given. In\nan inhomogeneous plasma placed in an external magnetic field, and for\nmagnetized electrons and un-magnetized ions, the IA mode propagates in any\ndirection and in this case the collisions make it growing on the account of the\nenergy stored in the density gradient. The growth rate is angle dependent. A\ncomparison with the collision-less kinetic density gradient driven IA\ninstability is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 09:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Many states of experimental and theoretical interests\nhave this property, e.g. Bell diagonal states, maximally correlated generalized\nBell diagonal states, generalized Dicke states, the Smolin state, and the\ngeneralization of D\\\"{u}r's multipartite bound entangled states.

However even here,\nplanetesimal formation may be limited by the loss of solid material through\nradial drift, and by collisional fragmentation of the particles. Our aim is to\ninvestigate the possibility that solid particles are trapped at local pressure\nmaxima in the dynamically evolving disk. We perform the first 3-D global\nnon-ideal MHD calculations of the disk treating the turbulence driven by the\nmagneto-rotational instability. The domain contains an inner MRI-active region\nnear the young star and an outer midplane dead zone, with the transition\nbetween the two modeled by a sharp increase in the magnetic diffusivity. The\nazimuthal magnetic fields generated in the active zone oscillate over time,\nchanging sign about every 150 years. We thus observe the radial structure of\nthe `butterfly pattern' seen previously in local shearing-box simulations. The\nmean magnetic field diffuses from the active zone into the dead zone, where the\nReynolds stress nevertheless dominates. The greater total accretion stress in\nthe active zone leads to a net reduction in the surface density, so that after\n800 years an approximate steady state is reached in which a local radial\nmaximum in the midplane pressure lies near the transition radius. We also\nobserve the formation of density ridges within the active zone. The dead zone\nin our models possesses a mean magnetic field, significant Reynolds stresses\nand a steady local pressure maximum at the inner edge, where the outward\nmigration of planetary embryos and the efficient trapping of solid material are\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 13:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the\nfeature level to construct the multibiometric template. Finally, a 256bit\nsecure cryptographic key is generated from the multibiometric template.

In this paper we expose\nthe algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well\nas a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these\nstates. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for\nexpressing general multipartite states.\n  We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an\nalgebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra\n(CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally\nequivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the\nGHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are\nSLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative\nFrobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states\nfollows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs.\n  Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical\ncalculus. This calculus is expressive enough to generate and reason about\narbitrary multipartite states, which are obtained by \"composing\" the GHZ- and\nW-states, giving rise to a rich graphical paradigm for general multipartite\nentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 13:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 17:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-18"}

RCW 34 consists of three different\nregions. A large bubble has been detected on the IRAC images in which a cluster\nof intermediate- and low-mass class II objects is found. At the northern edge\nof this bubble, an HII region is located, ionized by 3 OB stars. Intermediate\nmass stars (2 - 3 Msun) are detected of G- and K- spectral type. These stars\nare still in the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase. North of the HII region, a\nphoton-dominated region is present, marking the edge of a dense molecular cloud\ntraced by H2 emission. Several class 0/I objects are associated with this\ncloud, indicating that star formation is still taking place. The distance to\nRCW 34 is revised to 2.5 +- 0.2 kpc and an age estimate of 2 - 1 Myrs is\nderived from the properties of the PMS stars inside the HII region. The most\nlikely scenario for the formation of the three regions is that star formation\npropagates from South to North. First the bubble is formed, produced by\nintermediate- and low-mass stars only, after that, the HII region is formed\nfrom a dense core at the edge of the molecular cloud, resulting in the\nexpansion as a champagne flow. More recently, star formation occurred in the\nrest of the molecular cloud. Two different formation scenarios are possible:\n(a) The bubble with the cluster of low- and intermediate mass stars triggered\nthe formation of the O star at the edge of the molecular cloud which in turn\ninduces the current star-formation in the molecular cloud. (b) An external\ntriggering is responsible for the star-formation propagating from South to\nNorth.

To\nthis end we present a modified version of the FRD model proposed by Carrasco\nand Parry \\cite{Carrasco1994} to quantify the the number of scattering defects\nwithin an optical fibre using a single parameter. The model predicts many\ntrends which are seen experimentally, for example, a decrease in FRD as core\ndiameter increases, and also as wavelength increases. However the model also\npredicts a strong dependence on FRD with length that is not seen\nexperimentally. By adapting the single fibre model to include a second fibre,\nwe can quantify the amount of FRD due to stress caused by the method of\ntermination. By fitting the model to experimental data we find that polishing\nthe fibre causes more stress to be induced in the end of the fibre compared to\na simple cleave technique. We estimate that the number of scattering defects\ncaused by polishing is approximately double that produced by cleaving. By\nplacing limits on the end-effect, the model can be used to estimate the\nresidual-length dependence in very long fibres, such as those required for\nExtremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), without having to carry out costly\nexperiments.

We start\nwith an exploration of the structure of fixed point combinators (fpc's), vastly\ngeneralizing the well-known fact that if Y is an fpc, Y(SI) is again an fpc,\ngenerating the Boehm sequence of fpc's. Using the infinitary lambda-calculus we\ndevise infinitely many other generation schemes for fpc's. In this way we find\nschemes and building blocks to construct new fpc's in a modular way.\n  Having created a plethora of new fixed point combinators, the task is to\nprove that they are indeed new. That is, we have to prove their\nbeta-inconvertibility. Known techniques via Boehm Trees do not apply, because\nall fpc's have the same Boehm Tree (BT). Therefore, we employ `clocked BT's',\nwith annotations that convey information of the tempo in which the data in the\nBT are produced. BT's are thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour,\nleading to a refined discrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding\nequality is strictly intermediate between beta-convertibility and BT-equality,\nthe equality in the classical models of lambda-calculus.

Finally, we increase the\ndiscrimination power by a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic\nclock'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 15:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-15"}

The method is a dielectric scaling\napproximation that is based on a scissor approximation. It adds an energy shift\nto the bandgap provided by the local density approximation (LDA) of the density\nfunctional theory (DFT). The energy shift consists of a material-independent\nconstant weighted by the inverse of the high-frequency dielectric constant. The\nsalient feature of the approach is the fast calculation of the dielectric\nconstant of alloys via the Green function (GF) of the TB-LMTO (tight-binding\nlinear muffin-tin orbitals) in the atomic sphere approximation (ASA). When it\nis applied to highly mismatched semiconductor alloys (HMAs) like Zn Te$_x$\nSe$_{1-x}$, this method provides a band bowing parameter that is different from\nthe band bowing parameter calculated with the LDA due to the bowing exhibited\nalso by the high-frequency dielectric constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 15:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-08"}

In particular, we study the\nproblem of removing as many local extrema (minima and maxima) as possible from\nthe terrain. We show that removing only minima or only maxima can be done\noptimally in O(n log n) time, for a terrain with n vertices. Interestingly,\nhowever, removing both the minima and maxima simultaneously is NP-hard, and is\neven hard to approximate within a factor of O(log log n) unless P=NP. Moreover,\nwe show that even a simplified version of the problem where vertices can have\nonly two different heights is already NP-hard, a result we obtain by proving\nhardness of a special case of 2-Disjoint Connected Subgraphs, a problem that\nhas lately received considerable attention from the graph-algorithms community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 15:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2011 10:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-15"}
