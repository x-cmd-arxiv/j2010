As these studies have been limited to\ndoped Mott insulators, the important question arises how this compares with\ndoped band insulators where similar el-ph couplings should be at work. The\narchetypical case is the perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO), well known for its giant\ndielectric constant of 10000 at low temperature, exceeding that of\nLa$_2$CuO$_4$ by a factor of 500. Based on this fact, it has been suggested\nthat doped STO should be the archetypical bipolaron superconductor. Here we\nreport an ARPES study from high-quality surfaces of lightly doped SrTiO$_3$.\nComparing to lightly doped Mott insulators, we find the signatures of only\nmoderate electron-phonon coupling: a dispersion anomaly associated with the low\nfrequency optical phonon with a $\\lambda'\\sim0.3$ and an overall bandwidth\nrenormalization suggesting an overall $\\lambda'\\sim0.7$ coming from the higher\nfrequency phonons. Further, we find no clear signatures of the large pseudogap\nor small polaron phenomena.

To\nresolve these conflicts, we present a coarse-grained model to calculate the B\ncell population development in affinity maturation, which allows a\ncomprehensive analysis of its parameter space to look for optimal values of\nmutation rate, selection strength, and initial antibody-antigen binding level\nthat maximize the affinity improvement. With these optimized parameters, the\nmodel is compatible with the experimental observations such as the ~100-fold\naffinity improvements, the number of mutations, the hypermutation rate, and the\n\"all or none\" phenomenon. Moreover, we study the reasons behind the optimal\nparameters. The optimal mutation rate, in agreement with the hypermutation rate\nin vivo, results from a tradeoff between accumulating enough beneficial\nmutations and avoiding too many deleterious or lethal mutations. The optimal\nselection strength evolves as a balance between the need for affinity\nimprovement and the requirement to pass the population bottleneck. These\nfindings point to the conclusion that germinal centers have been optimized by\nevolution to generate strong affinity antibodies effectively and rapidly. In\naddition, we study the enhancement of affinity improvement due to B cell\nmigration between germinal centers.

Apart from their intrinsic\ninterest, such questions have applications in several probabilistic and\ngeometric contexts (Barthe et al. 2005). In this paper, our aim is to revisit\nsome known results of this flavour with a new point of view. Roughly speaking,\nwe will endow the ball with some kind of Dirichlet distribution that\ngeneralizes the uniform one and will follow the method developed in Skibinsky\n(1967), Chang et al. (1993) in the context of the randomized moment space. The\nmain idea is to build a suitable coordinate change involving independent random\nvariables. Moreover, we will shed light on a nice connection between the\nrandomized balls and the randomized moment space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 08:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 08:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-22"}

The temperature dependence of lattice parameters, tilt angle,\ncalculated polarization $(P_{s})$, volume, and integrated intensity of\nsuperlattice and magnetic reflections show an anomaly around 170 K. Impedance\nspectroscopy, dielectric and ac conductivity measurements were performed in\ntemperature range $473K \\leq T \\leq 573K$ to probe the origin of large remnant\npolarization and frequency dependent broad transitions with large dielectric\nconstant near $T_c^{FE}$. Results of impedance spectroscopy measurements\nclearly show contributions of both grain and grain boundaries throughout the\nfrequency range ($10^{3}$ Hz$\\leq f\\leq 10^{7} $ Hz). It could be concluded\nthat the grain boundaries are more resistive and capacitive as compared to the\ngrains, resulting in inhomogeneities in the sample causing broad frequency\ndependent dielectric anomalies. Enhancement in dielectric constant and remnant\npolarization values are possibly due to space charge polarization caused by\npiling of charges at the interface of grains and grain boundaries.

During\nthe Sumatra OBS (ocean bottom seismometer) survey, a wide angle seismic profile\nwas acquired across the epicentral region. A seismic velocity model was\nobtained from combined travel time tomography and forward modeling. Together\nwith reflection seismic data from the SeaCause II cruise, the deep structure of\nthe source region of the great earthquake is revealed. Four to five kilometers\nof sediments overlie the oceanic crust at the trench, and the subducting slab\ncan be imaged down to a depth of 35 km. We find a crystalline backstop 120 km\nfrom the trench axis, below the fore arc basin. A high velocity zone at the\nlower landward limit of the raycovered domain, at 22 km depth, marks a shallow\ncontinental Moho, 170 km from the trench.

The downdip limit of the 2004 rupture as inferred\nfrom aftershocks is within the 350C 450C temperature range, but this limit is\n210-250 km from the trench axis and is much deeper than the fore arc Moho.

The\nquestion appears whether Cyg X-3 can be also detected in the TeV gamma-rays by\nthe Cherenkov telescopes.\n  Here we discuss this problem in detail based on the anisotropic inverse\nCompton (IC) e-p pair cascade model successfully applied to TeV gamma-ray\nbinaries. We calculate the gamma-ray light curves and gamma-ray spectra\nexpected from the cascade process occurring inside the Cyg X-3 binary system.\nIt is found that the gamma-ray light curves at GeV energies can be consistent\nwith the gamma-ray light curve observed by the Fermi for reasonable parameters\nof the orbit of the injection source of relativistic electrons. Moreover, we\nshow that in such a model the sub-TeV gamma-ray emission (above 100 GeV) is\nexpected to be below sensitivities of the present Cherenkov telescopes assuming\nthat electrons are accelerated in Cyg X-3 to TeV energies. The next stage\nCherenkov telescopes (MAGIC II, HESS II) should have the energy threshold in\nthe range 20-30 GeV, in order to have a chance to detect the signal from Cyg\nX-3.

The evidence in these research fields is here\nanalyzed and found to agree well with the properties of Rydberg Matter (RM).\nThis material has been studied with numerous methods in the laboratory. Alkali\natoms, mainly Na, reach the mesosphere in the form of interplanetary\n(meteoritic, cometary) dust. The planar RM clusters NaN usually contain N = 19,\n37 or 61 atoms, and have the density of air at 90 km altitude where they float.\nThe diameters of the clusters are 10-100 nm from laboratory high precision\nradio frequency spectroscopic studies. Such experiments show that RM clusters\ninteract strongly with radar frequencies: this explains the radio frequency\nheating and reflection studies of PMSE layers. The clusters give the low\ntemperature in the mesosphere by efficient selective radiation at long\nwavelengths, which is observed in RF emission experiments. The lowest possible\nstable temperature of the mesopause is calculated for the first time to be 121\nK in agreement with measurements, based on the strong optical activity at long\nwavelengths in RM. Sporadic sodium layers are explained in a unique way as due\nto shockwaves in the RM layers. Due to the high electronic excitation energy in\nRM clusters, they induce efficient reactions forming ions of all atoms and\nmolecules in the atmosphere thus providing condensation nuclei for water\nvapour. This finally gives the visible part of the PMC structure. The present\ncontribution fills the gap between and partially replaces the separate theories\nused to describe the various aspects of these intriguing phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 10:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-09"}

Over this range,\ncoupled motion to shear is well described by known geometrical rules and a\ntransition from coupling to sliding motion is also reproduced. Amplitude\nequations for alloys are derived phenomenologically in a Ginzburg-Landau\nspirit. Vegard's law is shown to be naturally described by seeking a gauge\ninvariant form of those equations under a transformation that corresponds to a\nlattice expansion and deviations from Vegard's law can be easily incorporated.\nThose equations realistically describe the dilute alloy limit and have the same\nflexibility as conventional phase-field models for incorporating arbitrary\nfree-energy/composition curves...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 11:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The verifier is only allowed to read a very small\nportion of the proof, and in return is allowed to err with some bounded\nprobability. The probability that the verifier accepts a false proof is called\nthe soundness error, and is an important parameter of a PCP system that one\nseeks to minimize. Constructing PCPs with sub-constant soundness error and, at\nthe same time, a minimal number of queries into the proof (namely two) is\nespecially important due to applications for inapproximability.\n  In this work we construct such PCP verifiers, i.e., PCPs that make only two\nqueries and have sub-constant soundness error. Our construction can be viewed\nas a combinatorial alternative to the \"manifold vs. point\" construction, which\nis the only construction in the literature for this parameter range. The\n\"manifold vs. point\" PCP is based on a low degree test, while our construction\nis based on a direct product test. We also extend our construction to yield a\ndecodable PCP (dPCP) with the same parameters. By plugging in this dPCP into\nthe scheme of Dinur and Harsha (FOCS 2009) one gets an alternative construction\nof the result of Moshkovitz and Raz (FOCS 2008), namely: a construction of\ntwo-query PCPs with small soundness error and small alphabet size.\n  Our construction of a PCP is based on extending the derandomized direct\nproduct test of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (STOC 09) to a derandomized\nparallel repetition theorem. More accurately, our PCP construction is obtained\nin two steps. We first prove a derandomized parallel repetition theorem for\nspecially structured PCPs.

These hot\nbubbles are followed by a nonlinear differential equation system with finite\namplitude non-homologous perturbations which is solved in a solar model. Our\nresults show the possibility of a direct connection between the dynamic\nphenomena of the solar core and the atmospheric activity. Namely, an initial\nheating about DQ_0 ~ 10^{31}-10^{37} ergs can be enough for a bubble to reach\nthe outer convective zone. Our calculations show that a hot bubble can arrive\ninto subphotospheric regions with DQ_final ~ 10^{28} - 10^{34} ergs with a high\nspeed, up to 10 km s-1, approaching the local sound speed. We point out that\nthe developing sonic boom transforms the shock front into accelerated particle\nbeam injected upwards into the top of loop carried out by the hot bubble above\nits forefront traveling from the solar interior. As a result, a new perspective\narises to explain flare energetics. We show that the particle beams generated\nby energetic deep-origin hot bubbles in the subphotospheric layers have masses,\nenergies, and chemical compositions in the observed range of solar\nchromospheric and coronal flares. It is shown how the emergence of a hot bubble\ninto subphotospheric regions offers a natural mechanism that can generate both\nthe eruption leading to the flare and the observed coronal magnetic topology\nfor reconnection.

We concentrate on the\nso-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission requires a\nSignal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) larger than a given threshold.\nWith Rayleigh fading and the SINR averaged over the duration of the packet\ntransmission, both models lead to closed form expressions for the probability\nof successful transmission. We show an excellent matching of these results with\nsimulations. Using our models we compare the performances of non-slotted Aloha\nto previously studied slotted Aloha. We observe that when the path loss is not\nvery strong both models, when appropriately optimized, exhibit similar\nperformance. For stronger path loss non-slotted Aloha performs worse than\nslotted Aloha, however when the path loss exponent is equal to 4 its density of\nsuccessfully received packets is still 75% of that in the slotted scheme. This\nis still much more than the 50% predicted by the well-known analysis where\nsimultaneous transmissions are never successful.
