It has been shown in the speech\nrecognition literature that parameter estimation using the current MMI\nparadigm, lattice-based MMI, consistently outperforms maximum likelihood\nestimation, but this is at the expense of undesirable convergence properties.\nIn particular, recognition performance is sensitive to the number of times that\nthe iterative MMI estimation algorithm, extended Baum-Welch, is performed. In\nfact, too many iterations of extended Baum-Welch will lead to degraded\nperformance, despite the fact that the MMI criterion improves at each\niteration. This phenomenon is at variance with the analogous behavior of\nmaximum likelihood estimation -- at least for the HMMs used in speech\nrecognition -- and it has previously been attributed to `over fitting'. In this\npaper, we present an analysis of lattice-based MMI that demonstrates, first of\nall, that the asymptotic behavior of lattice-based MMI is much worse than was\npreviously understood, i.e. it does not appear to converge at all, and, second\nof all, that this is not due to `over fitting'. Instead, we demonstrate that\nthe `over fitting' phenomenon is the result of standard methodology that\nexacerbates the poor behavior of two key approximations in the lattice-based\nMMI machinery. We also demonstrate that if we modify the standard methodology\nto improve the validity of these approximations, then the convergence\nproperties of lattice-based MMI become benign without sacrificing improvements\nto recognition accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 16:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-04"}

The radio emission appears much more\ncompact, although clearly aligned with the narrow line region. The collisional\nphase of the soft X-ray emission may be due to starburst, requiring a star\nformation rate of $\\simeq5-9$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, but there is no clear\nevidence of this kind of activity from other wavelengths. On the other hand, it\nmay be related to the radio ejecta, responsible for the heating of the plasma\ninteracting with the outflow, but the estimated pressure of the hot gas is much\nlarger than the pressure of the radio jets, assuming equipartition and under\nreasonable physical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 17:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We test each\nof these scenarios for bar stability, ruling out dust extinction. We also find\nthat the gas likely does not trace the gravitational potential, since the\npredicted stellar rotation curve is then inconsistent with the observed stellar\nrotation curve. The disc is well fit by an inner-truncated profile, but the\npossibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the Type II profile is also\na realistic model. We further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with\ngamma > 1; the bulge has a lower M/L than the disc, suggesting a star forming\ncomponent in the centre of the galaxy; and the bulge, as expected for this late\ntype galaxy, has a low Sersic index with n_b~1-2, suggesting a formation\nhistory dominated by secular evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 19:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2010 16:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 17:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this scenario, the dynamical masses and energy densities of\nactive and sterile neutrinos can be consistently embedded into the generalized\nChaplygin gas (GCG), the unified dark sector model.

In most cases, each node has finite-mean geometric random delay\nand thus a positive next hop throughput.

Whereas superconductivity\ncan be induced in the RFeAsO (R = rare earth) and AEFe2As2 (AE = Ba, Sr, Ca))\nfamilies by a number of means, transition metal doping of BaFe2As2, e.g.\nBa(Fe1-xTMx)2As2, offers the easiest experimental access to a wide set of\nmaterials. In this review we present an overview and summary of the effect of\nTM doping (TM = Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, and Rh) on BaFe2As2. The resulting phase\ndiagrams reveal the nature of the interaction between the structural, magnetic\nand superconducting phase transitions in these compounds and delineate a region\nof phase space that allows for the stabilization of superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 21:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The 'critical' superconducting phase is\ncharacterized by the enhancement of the transition temperature with respect to\nBCS result, by the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of superconductive order\nparameter and local density of states.

The present work focuses on the\nevolutionary characteristics of hydrogen mixing into the He-flash convective\nzones during the core and shell He flashes which occurs for the models with\n[Fe/H] <~ -2.5. Evolution is followed from the zero age MS to the TPAGB phase\nincluding the hydrogen engulfment by the He-flash convection during the RGB or\nAGB phase. There exist various types of mixing episodes of how the H mixing\nsets in and how it affects the final abundances at the surface. In particular,\nwe find H ingestion events without dredge-ups that enables repeated\nneutron-capture nucleosynthesis in the He flash convective zones with 13\nC(a,n)16 O as neutron source. For Z = 0, the mixing and dredge-up processes\nvary with the initial mass, which results in different final abundances in the\nsurface. We investigate the occurrence of these events for various initial mass\nand metallicity to find the metallicity dependence for the He-flash driven deep\nmixing (He-FDDM) and also for the third dredge-up (TDU) events. In our models,\nwe find He-FDDM for M <= 3Msun for Z = 0 and for M <~ 2Msun for -5 <~ [Fe/H] <~\n-3. On the other hand, the occurrence of the TDU is limited to the mass range\nof ~1.5Msun to ~5Msun for [Fe/H] = -3, which narrows with decreasing\nmetallicity. The paper also discusses the implications of the results of model\ncomputations for observations. We compared the abundance pattern of CNO\nabundances with observed metal-poor stars. The origins of most iron-deficient\nstars are discussed by assuming that these stars are affected by binary mass\ntransfer.

Results show that if additional intervention strategies were not\nused to delay the time of pandemic peak, vaccination may not be able to\nconsiderably reduce the cumulative number of cases, even when the mass\nvaccination campaign is started as early as mid-October. Prioritized\nvaccination would be crucial in slowing down the pandemic evolution and\nreducing its burden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 01:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-10"}

However, while these recognize the level of\nroughness they tell us little about the independent effect of its scale.

We\nhave used known properties of multiple star systems and Hot Jupiter systems to\npredict, a priori, the number of such false detections and the number of\ngenuine planet detections recovered in two hypothetical but realistic\nground-based transit surveys targeting fields close to the galactic plane (b~10\ndegrees): a shallow survey covering a magnitude range 10<V<13, and a deep\nsurvey covering a magnitude range 15<V<19. Our results are consistent with the\ncommonly-reported experience of false detections outnumbering planet detections\nby a factor of ~10 in shallow surveys, while in our synthetic deep survey we\nfind ~1-2 false detections for every planet detection. We characterize the\neclipsing binary configurations that are most likely to cause false detections\nand find that they can be divided into three main types: (i) two dwarfs\nundergoing grazing transits, (ii) two dwarfs undergoing low-latitude transits\nin which one component has a substantially smaller radius than the other, and\n(iii) two eclipsing dwarfs blended with one or more physically unassociated\nforeground stars. We also predict that a significant fraction of Hot Jupiter\ndetections are blended with the light from other stars, showing that care must\nbe taken to identify the presence of any unresolved neighbors in order to\nobtain accurate estimates of planetary radii.

When one of two\nmaximally entangled particles is measured, without measurement the state of\nanother one is determined simultaneously no matter how far the two particles is\nfrom each other. How can these phenomena take place since no object can move\nfaster than light speed in a vacuum? The key problem is due to the ignorance of\nthe interaction between a particle and a quantum vacuum. Just like the case\nwhere a gun suffers recoil from its firing of a bullet, when a particle is\ncreated from the quantum vacuum, the vacuum will be somewhat \"broken\"\ncorrespondingly, which can be described by a shadow state in the vacuum.\nThrough their shadows in the vacuum two quantum entangled particles can have a\ndistance-independent instantaneous interaction with each other. Quantum\nteleportation, quantum swap, and wave function collapse are explained in a\nsimilar way. Quantum object can be interpreted as a composite made up of a\nparticle and the shadowed quantum vacuum which is responsible for the wave\ncharacteristic of the particle wave duality. The quantum vacuum is not only the\norigin of all possible kinds of particles, but also the origin and the core of\nEastern mystics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 10:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-05"}

This paper\nconsiders the querying of such databases for convoys, a convoy being a group of\nobjects that have traveled together for some time. More specifically, this\npaper formalizes the concept of a convoy query using density-based notions, in\norder to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoy discovery is\nrelevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and\ncarpooling of vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on\ntrajectories in the literature, none of this can be applied to retrieve\ncorrectly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this, we develop three\nefficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known\nfilter-refinement framework. In the filter step, we apply line-simplification\ntechniques on the trajectories and establish distance bounds between the\nsimplified trajectories. This permits efficient convoy discovery over the\nsimplified trajectories without missing any actual convoys. In the refinement\nstep, the candidate convoys are further processed to obtain the actual convoys.\nOur comprehensive empirical study offers insight into the properties of the\npaper's proposals and demonstrates that the proposals are effective and\nefficient on real-world trajectory data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 11:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-05"}

We show the results of\nthe AGILE campaigns which took place on May-June 2008, July-August 2008, and\nOctober 2008-January 2009. During the May 2008-January 2009 period, the source\naverage flux was highly variable, from an average gamma-ray flux F(E>100MeV) >\n200E-8 ph/cm2/s in May-June 2008, to F(E>100MeV)~80E-8 ph/cm2/s in October\n2008-January 2009. The average gamma-ray spectrum between 100 MeV and 1 GeV can\nbe fit by a simple power law (Gamma_GRID ~ 2.0 to 2.2). Only 3-sigma upper\nlimits can be derived in the 20-60 keV energy band with Super-AGILE. During\nJuly-August 2007 and May-June 2008, RXTE measured a flux of F(3-20 keV)=\n8.4E-11 erg/cm2/s, and F(3-20 keV)=4.5E-11 erg/cm2/s, respectively and a\nconstant photon index Gamma_PCA=1.65. Swift/XRT observations were carried out\nduring all AGILE campaigns, obtaining a F(2-10 keV)=(0.9-7.5)E-11 erg/cm2/s and\na photon index Gamma_XRT=1.33-2.04. BAT measured an average flux of ~5 mCrab.\nGASP-WEBT monitored 3C 454.3 during the whole 2007-2008 period from the radio\nto the optical. A correlation analysis between the optical and the gamma-ray\nfluxes shows a time lag of tau=-0.4 days. An analysis of 15 GHz and 43 GHz VLBI\ncore radio flux observations shows an increasing trend of the core radio flux,\nanti- correlated with the higher frequency data. The modeling SEDs, and the\nbehavior of the long-term light curves in different energy bands, allow us to\ncompare the jet properties during different emission states, and to study the\ngeometrical properties of the jet on a time-span longer than one year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 15:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Oxidative\nphosphorylation by a series of membrane protein complexes I to IV, that is, the\nelectron transport chain, is the source of the electrochemical potential\ndifference or proton motive force (PMF) of protons across the inner\nmitochondrial membrane. The PMF is required for ATP production by complex V of\nthe electron transport chain, i.e. by FoF1-ATP synthase. Destroying cytochrome\nC oxidase (COX; complex IV) in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is achieved by the\ncationic photosensitizer Pt(II)-TMPyP. Electron microscopy revealed the\ndisruption of the mitochondrial christae as a primary step of PDT. Time\nresolved phosphorescence measurements identified COX as the binding site for\nPt(II)-TMPyP in living HeLa cells. As this photosensitizer competed with\ncytochrome C in binding to COX, destruction of COX might not only disturb ATP\nsynthesis but could expedite the release of cytochrome C to the cytosol\ninducing apoptosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 15:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It is shown that the average formation lengths of\npseudoscalar mesons, produced in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS)\nof leptons on different targets, depend from their electrical charges. In\nparticular the average formation lengths of positively charged hadrons are\nlarger than of negatively charged ones. This statement is fulfiled for all\nusing scaling functions, for $z$ (the fraction of the virtual photon energy\ntransferred to the detected hadron) larger than 0.15, for all nuclear targets\nand any value of the Bjorken scaling variable $x_{Bj}$. In all cases, the main\nmechanism is direct production of pseudoscalar mesons. Including in\nconsideration additional mechanism of production in result of decay of\nresonances, leads to decrease of average formation lengths. It is shown that\nthe average formation lengths of positively (negatively) charged mesons are\nslowly rising (decreasing) functions of $x_{Bj}$.
