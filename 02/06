That is, the goal is to place\nthe model in a single shot close to the right pose (position, orientation, and\nscale) in a given image so that the model boundaries fall in the close vicinity\nof object boundaries in the image. This is achieved via the following set of\nkey ideas: (a) A semi-automatic way of constructing a multi-object shape model\nassembly. (b) A novel strategy of encoding, via b-scale, the pose relationship\nbetween objects in the training images and their intensity patterns captured in\nb-scale images. (c) A hierarchical mechanism of positioning the model, in a\none-shot way, in a given image from a knowledge of the learnt pose relationship\nand the b-scale image of the given image to be segmented. The evaluation\nresults on a set of 20 routine clinical abdominal female and male CT data sets\nindicate the following: (1) Incorporating a large number of objects improves\nthe recognition accuracy dramatically. (2) The recognition algorithm can be\nthought as a hierarchical framework such that quick replacement of the model\nassembly is defined as coarse recognition and delineation itself is known as\nfinest recognition. (3) Scale yields useful information about the relationship\nbetween the model assembly and any given image such that the recognition\nresults in a placement of the model close to the actual pose without doing any\nelaborate searches or optimization.

The challenge lies in separating the cosmological signal\nfrom other stochastic processes such as instrument noise and astrophysical\nforegrounds. One approach is to build two or more detectors and cross correlate\ntheir output, thereby enhancing the common gravitational wave signal relative\nto the uncorrelated instrument noise. When only one detector is available, as\nwill likely be the case with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),\nalternative analysis techniques must be developed.

Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and\nrelatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate\na sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies\naccording to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we\nre-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a\nlog-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to\nthe gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential\nequation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of creep compliance\nduring cell stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery\nthat we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population\nvariation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep\nand recovery regimes.

In order to probe the physical conditions of the\nISM in which CH+ forms, we propose the use of CH3+ observations. The pathway to\nforming CH3+ begins with CH+, and a steady state analysis of CH3+ and the\nreaction intermediary CH2+ results in a relationship between the CH+ and CH3+\nabundances. This relationship depends on the molecular hydrogen fraction, f_H2,\nand gas temperature, T, so observations of CH+ and CH3+ can be used to infer\nthe properties of the gas in which both species reside. We present observations\nof both molecules along the diffuse cloud sight line toward Cyg OB2 No. 12.\nUsing our computed column densities and upper limits, we put constraints on the\nf_H2 vs. T parameter space in which CH+ and CH3+ form. We find that average,\nstatic, diffuse molecular cloud conditions (i.e. f_H2>0.2, T~60 K) are excluded\nby our analysis. However, current theory suggests that non-equilibrium effects\ndrive the reaction C+ + H_2 --> CH+ + H, endothermic by 4640 K. If we consider\na higher effective temperature due to collisions between neutrals and\naccelerated ions, the CH3+ partition function predicts that the overall\npopulation will be spread out into several excited rotational levels.

Globular cluster\nsystems in most large galaxies display bimodal color and metallicity\ndistributions, which are often interpreted as indicating two distinct modes of\ncluster formation. The metal-rich and metal-poor clusters have systematically\ndifferent locations and kinematics in their host galaxies. However, the red and\nblue clusters have similar internal properties, such as the masses, sizes, and\nages. It is therefore interesting to explore whether both metal-rich and\nmetal-poor clusters could form by a common mechanism and still be consistent\nwith the bimodal distribution.

We assume that\nmassive star clusters form only during mergers of massive gas-rich galaxies and\ntune the model parameters to reproduce the observed distribution in the Galaxy.\nA wide, but not entire, range of model realizations produces metallicity\ndistributions consistent with the data.

In this paper, we carefully discuss this\npoint considering that fourth order gravity models are dynamically equivalent\nto the O'Hanlon Lagrangian. This is a special case of scalar-tensor gravity\ncharacterized only by self-interaction potential and that, in the Newtonian\nlimit, this implies a non-standard behavior that cannot be compared with the\nusual PPN limit of General Relativity.\n  The result turns out to be completely different from the one of Brans-Dicke\ntheory and in particular suggests that it is misleading to consider the PPN\nparameters of this theory with $\\omega_{BD} = 0$ in order to characterize the\nhomologous quantities of $f(R)$-gravity.

The magnification of individual SNe Ia can be\ncomputed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halo\nmodels. We model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singular\nisothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeying\nluminosity dependent scaling laws. A homogeneously selected sample of 175 SNe\nIa from the first 3-years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) in the redshift\nrange 0.2 < z < 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloes\nassociated with foreground galaxies. The best-fitting velocity dispersion\nscaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We further\nfind that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and star\nforming galaxies are consistent with empirical Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher\nrelations, respectively. If we make no assumption on the normalisation of these\nrelations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 per\ncent confidence level. Using recent models of dust extinction we deduce that\nthe impact of this effect on our results is very small. We also investigate the\nbrightness scatter of SNe Ia due to gravitational lensing. The gravitational\nlensing scatter is approximately proportional to the SN Ia redshift. We find\nthe constant of proportionality to be B = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (B < 0.12 mag\nat the 95 per cent confidence level). If this model is correct, the\ncontribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of SNe Ia is\nsmall for the SNLS sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2010 12:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
