As we\nneglect gas pressure the slow mode is absent and therefore only coupled MHD\nfast and Alfven modes remain. Two types of numerical experiments are performed.\nFirst, the resonant wave energy transfer between a fast normal mode of the\nsystem and local Alfven waves is analyzed. It is seen how, because of resonant\ncoupling, the fast wave with global character transfers its energy to Alfvenic\noscillations localized around a particular magnetic surface within the arcade,\nthus producing the damping of the initial fast MHD mode. Second, the time\nevolution of a localized impulsive excitation, trying to mimic a nearby coronal\ndisturbance, is considered. In this case, the generated fast wavefront leaves\nits energy on several magnetic surfaces within the arcade. The system is\ntherefore able to trap energy in the form of Alfvenic oscillations, even in the\nabsence of a density enhancement such as that of a coronal loop. These local\noscillations are subsequently phase-mixed to smaller spatial scales. The amount\nof wave energy trapped by the system via wave energy conversion strongly\ndepends on the wavelength of perturbations in the perpendicular direction, but\nis almost independent from the ratio of the magnetic to density scale heights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 16:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 12:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Neither the hypothesis that galaxies which formed earlier\nhave much higher densities nor their luminosity evolution, mergers ratio, or\nmassive outflows due to a quasar feedback mechanism are enough to justify such\na strong size evolution. Also, at high redshift, the intrinsic ultraviolet\nsurface brightness would be prohibitively high with this evolution, and the\nvelocity dispersion much higher than observed. We explore here another\npossibility to overcome this problem by considering different cosmological\nscenarios that might make the observed angular sizes compatible with a weaker\nevolution.\n  One of the models explored, a very simple phenomenological extrapolation of\nthe linear Hubble law in a Euclidean static universe, fits the angular size vs.\nredshift dependence quite well, which is also approximately proportional to 1/z\nwith this cosmological model. There are no free parameters derived ad hoc,\nalthough the error bars allow a slight size/luminosity evolution. The type Ia\nsupernovae Hubble diagram can also be explained in terms of this model with no\nad hoc fitted parameter.\n  WARNING: I do not argue here that the true Universe is static.

The goal is to locate\na tree-shaped facility such that the sum of setup and penalty cost is\nminimized. The setup cost equals the sum of edge lengths taken by the facility\nand the penalty cost is the sum of penalties of all customers whose distance to\nthe facility exceeds their radius. The indirect covering subtree problem\ngeneralizes the single maximum coverage location problem on trees where the\nfacility is a node rather than a subtree. Indirect covering subtree can be\nsolved in $O(n\\log^2 n)$ time (Kim et al., 1996).

Compared to other Swift GRBs, GRB 081008 has a\ntypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during the\nprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. The\nearly X-ray emission seen by the Swift/XRT was dominated by the softening tail\nof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after the\nSwift/BAT detections. Optical observations that started shortly after the first\nactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. We interpret\nthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the early\nburst activities. A second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-ray\npulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve and\nthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. We\nsuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injection\ninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch of\nburst activities. These early observations thus provide a potential probe for\nthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. The later lightcurve of GRB\n081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and X-ray. The\ntemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.\nOur broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral break\nwithin optical.

Prototype systems can\nbe characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Here, we use pulsed-continuous\nwave microwave spectroscopy to study the behavior of electrons trapped at\ndefects within the gate dielectric of a sol-gel-based high-k silicon MOSFET.\nDisorder leads to a wide distribution in trap properties, allowing more than\n1000 traps to be individually addressed in a single transistor within the\naccessible frequency domain. Their dynamical behavior is explored by pulsing\nthe microwave excitation over a range of times comparable to the phase\ncoherence time and the lifetime of the electron in the trap. Trap occupancy is\nlimited to a single electron, which can be manipulated by resonant microwave\nexcitation and the resulting change in trap occupancy is detected by the change\nin the channel current of the transistor. The trap behavior is described by a\nclassical damped driven simple harmonic oscillator model, with the phase\ncoherence, lifetime and coupling strength parameters derived from a continuous\nwave (CW) measurement only. For pulse times shorter than the phase coherence\ntime, the energy exchange between traps, due to the coupling, strongly\nmodulates the observed drain current change.

Optical\nspectroscopy shows that at peak SN 2009ip had a 10,000 K photosphere and its\nspectrum was dominated by narrow H Balmer emission, similar to classical LBV\ngiant outbursts, also known as \"supernova impostors.\" The spectra of UGC 2773\nOT2009-1, which also have narrow H alpha emission, are dominated by a forest of\nabsorption lines, similar to an F-type supergiant. Blueshifted absorption lines\ncorresponding to ejecta at a velocity of 2000 - 7000 km/s are present in later\nspectra of SN 2009ip -- an unprecedented observation for LBV outbursts,\nindicating that the event was the result of a supersonic explosion, rather than\na subsonic outburst. The velocity of the absorption lines increases between two\nepochs, suggesting that there were two explosions in rapid succession. A rapid\nfading and rebrightening event concurrent with the onset of the high-velocity\nabsorption lines is consistent with the double-explosion model. A near-infrared\nexcess is present in the spectra and photometry of UGC 2773 OT2009-1 that is\nconsistent with ~2100 K dust emission. We compare the properties of these two\nevents and place them in the context of other known massive star outbursts such\nas eta Car, NGC 300 OT2008-1, and SN 2008S. This qualitative analysis suggests\nthat massive star outbursts have many physical differences which can manifest\nas the different observables seen in these two interesting objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 03:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This is an order-unit\nspace with some specific properties. It becomes a Jordan operator algebra under\na certain set of additional conditions, but does not own a multiplication\noperation in the most general case. A major objective of the present paper is\nthe search for such examples of the structure mentioned above that do not stem\nfrom Jordan operator algebras; first natural candidates are matrix algebras\nover the octonions and other nonassociative rings. Therefore, the case when a\nnonassociative commutative multiplication exists is studied without assuming\nthat it satisfies the Jordan condition. The characteristics of the resulting\nalgebra are analyzed. This includes the uniqueness of the spectral resolution\nas well as a criterion for its existence, subalgebras that are Jordan algebras,\nassociative subalgebras, and more different levels of compatibility than\noccurring in standard quantum mechanics. However, the paper cannot provide the\ndesired example, but contribute to the search by the identification of some\ntypical differences between the potential examples and the Jordan operator\nalgebras and by negative results concerning some first natural candidates. The\npossibility that no such example exists cannot be ruled out. However, this\nwould result in an unexpected new characterization of Jordan operator algebras,\nwhich would have a significant impact on quantum axiomatics since some\ncustomary axioms (e.g., powerassociativity or the sum postulate for\nobservables) might turn out to be redundant then.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 08:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-04"}

Methods: We categorise different classification\nmethods according to their capabilities. Based on this categorisation, we\npresent a probabilistic classification algorithm that automatically detects the\noptimal classes preferred by the data. We explore the reliability of this\nalgorithm in systematic tests. Using a small sample of bright galaxies from the\nSDSS, we demonstrate the performance of this algorithm in practice. We are able\nto disentangle the problems of classification and parametrisation of galaxy\nmorphologies in this case. Results: We give physical arguments that a\nprobabilistic classification scheme is necessary. The algorithm we present\nproduces reasonable morphological classes and object-to-class assignments\nwithout any prior assumptions. Conclusions: There are sophisticated automated\nclassification algorithms that meet all necessary requirements, but a lot of\nwork is still needed on the interpretation of the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 09:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We\nhave started a programme with GMRT to exploit this correlation at flux density\nlevels about 10 to 100 times deeper than the known high-redshift radio galaxies\nwhich were identified primarily using the already available radio catalogues.\nIn our programme, we have obtained deep, high resolution radio observations at\n150 MHz with GMRT for several 'deep' fields which are well studied at higher\nradio frequencies and in other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, with an\naim to detect candidate high redshift radio galaxies.

However, both statistics suffer from\nintrinsic-shear alignment, which is one of their limiting systematics. The\nnulling technique is a model-independent method developed to eliminate\nintrinsic-shear alignment at the two-point level. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nulling technique can also be naturally generalized to the three-point\nlevel, controlling the corresponding GGI systematics. We show that under the\nassumption of exact redshift information the intrinsic-shear alignment\ncontamination can be completely eliminated. To show how well the nulling\ntechnique performs on data with limited redshift information, we apply the\nnulling technique to three-point weak lensing statistics from a fictitious\nsurvey analogous to a typical future deep imaging survey, in which the\nthree-point intrinsic-shear alignment systematics is generated from a power-law\ntoy model. Using 10 redshift bins, the nulling technique leads to a factor of\n10 suppression of the GGI/GGG ratio, and reduces the bias on cosmological\nparameters to less than the original statistical error. More detailed redshift\ninformation allowing for finer redshift bins leads to better reduction of bias.\nThe information loss during the nulling procedure doubles the statistical error\non cosmological parameters. A comparison of the nulling technique with an\nunconditioned compression of the data suggests that part of the information\nloss can be retained by considering higher-order nulling weights during the\nnulling procedure. A combined analysis of two- and three-point statistics\nconfirms that the information contained in them is of comparable size and is\ncomplementary to each other, both before and after nulling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 12:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 11:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}

Various techniques have been implemented to counteract the misuse of\ncomputer systems in the form of firewalls, anti-virus software and intrusion\ndetection systems. The complexity of networks and dynamic nature of computer\nsystems leaves current methods with significant room for improvement. Computer\nscientists have recently drawn inspiration from mechanisms found in biological\nsystems and, in the context of computer security, have focused on the human\nimmune system (HIS). The human immune system provides a high level of\nprotection from constant attacks. By examining the precise mechanisms of the\nhuman immune system, it is hoped the paradigm will improve the performance of\nreal intrusion detection systems. This paper presents an introduction to recent\ndevelopments in the field of immunology. It discusses the incorporation of a\nnovel immunological paradigm, Danger Theory, and how this concept is inspiring\nartificial immune systems (AIS). Applications within the context of computer\nsecurity are outlined drawing direct reference to the underlying principles of\nDanger Theory and finally, the current state of intrusion detection systems is\ndiscussed and improvements suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 10:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

Due to the complexity of the PSF of LBC, we decided to use two\ndifferent approaches, KSB and Shapelets, to measure the shape of background\ngalaxies and to derive the shear signal produced by the cluster. Then we\nestimated the cluster mass with both aperture densitometry and parametric model\nfits.\n  Results. The combination of the large aperture of the telescope and the wide\nfield of view allowed us to map a region well beyond the expected virial radius\nof the cluster and to get a high surface density of background galaxies (23\ngalaxies/arcmin^2).

If the extension used is a heat\nbath in thermal equilibrium, the concomitant change in the state of the bath\nnecessarily implies a heat exchange with it. The dependence of the average heat\ntransferred to the bath on the initial state of the system can then be found\nfrom the expectation value of a hermitian operator, which is named as the heat\ntransfer operator (HTO). The purpose of this article is the investigation of\nthe relation between the HTOs and the associated quantum operations. Since, any\ngiven quantum operation on a system can be realized by different baths and\nunitaries, many different HTOs are possible for each quantum operation. On the\nother hand, there are also strong restrictions on the HTOs which arise from the\nunitarity of the transformations. The most important of these is the Landauer\nerasure principle. This article is concerned with the question of finding a\ncomplete set of restrictions on the HTOs that are associated with a given\nquantum operation. An answer to this question has been found only for a subset\nof quantum operations. For erasure operations, these characterizations are\nequivalent to the generalized Landauer erasure principle.

This can be achieved by employing magnetic coordinates\nof which one is aligned along the magnetic field. This work presents an\napproach in which the position along the field lines is identified by the\ntoroidal angle, rather than the most commonly used poloidal angle. It will be\nshown that this approach has several advantages. Among these, periodicity in\nboth angles is retained. This property allows moving to an equivalent\nrepresentation in Fourier space with a reduced number of toroidal components.\nIt will be shown how this duality can be exploited to transform conventional\ncodes that use a spectral representation on the magnetic surface into codes\nwith a field-aligned coordinate. It is also shown that the new approach can be\ngeneralised to get rid of magnetic coordinates in the poloidal plane\naltogether, for a large class of models. Tests are carried out by comparing the\nnew approach with the conventional approach employing a uniform grid, for a\nbasic ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence model implemented by the two\ncorresponding versions of the ETAI3D code. These tests uncover an unexpected\nproperty of the model, that localized large parallel gradients can\nintermittently appear in the turbulent regime. This leaves open the question\nwhether this is a general property of plasma turbulence, which may lead one to\nreconsider some of the usual assumptions on micro-turbulence dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 14:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this context plasmonics, i.e., optics based on\nsurface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) offers new exciting prospects. SPPs are\nhybrid light/electron surface waves at the interface between a dielectric and a\nmetal and as such hold the potential for 2D optical functionality. Indeed, SPP\nelements as mirrors, splitters and interferometers have been recently\ndemonstrated. However, for plasmonics to qualify at the information technology\nlevel requires necessarily the realization of wavelength division\n(demultiplexing) which constitutes a fundamental ingredient of optical\ncommunication. In the following we experimentally demonstrate 2D SPP\ndemultiplexing in the visible spectral range by using photonic crystals for\nSPPs (plasmonic crystals). In addition, we demonstrate that plasmonic crystal\nare capable of realizing integrated linear multiports which could constitute\nbuilding blocks of analog or quantum optical computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2010 15:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

As an example we\nconsider a string of N+1 oscillators moving in the line. Each one `observes'\nthe relative velocity and position of only its nearest neighbors. This\ninformation is then used to determine its own acceleration. Now we fix all\nparameters except the number of oscillators.
