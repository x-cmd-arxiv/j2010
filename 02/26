Under other weather circumstances significant\nelectric field effects are expected to occur rarely, but nimbostratus clouds\ncan harbor fields that are large enough. In general, the contribution of the\nelectric field to the radio pulse has polarization properties that are\ndifferent from the geomagnetic pulse.

We use a one-dimensional energy\nbalance climate model (EBM) to examine how obliquity, spin rate, orbital\neccentricity, and ocean coverage might influence the onset of such a snowball\nstate. For an exoplanet, these parameters may be strikingly different from the\nvalues observed for Earth. Since, for constant semimajor axis, the annual mean\nstellar irradiation scales with (1-e^2)^(-1/2), one might expect the greatest\nhabitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as\n(1-e^2)^(-1/4). We find that this standard ansatz provides a reasonable lower\nbound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone, but the influence of\nobliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets on\neccentric orbits. For planets with eccentricity 0.5, our EBM suggests that the\ngreatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0.8 AU (78%!) depending\non obliquity, with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable against\nsnowball transitions. One might also expect that the long winter at an\neccentric planet's apoastron would render it more susceptible to global\nfreezing. Our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for Earth-like\nplanets around Sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermal\ninertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. Since\nplanets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from the\nstar, such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for direct\nobservations with missions such as TPF-Darwin.

We demonstrate\nthat almost 90 per cent of star-forming galaxies emit insufficient Lya to be\ndetected by standard selection criteria. Both samples show an anti-correlation\nof fesc with dust content, and we show that Lya- and Ha-selection recovers\npopulations that differ substantially in dust content and fesc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 21:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

There is evidence that Earth has\ngone through at least one globally frozen, \"snowball\" state in the last billion\nyears, which it is thought to have exited after several million years because\nglobal ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle, thereby allowing\ngreenhouse gases to build up to sufficient concentration to melt the ice. Due\nto the positive feedback caused by the high albedo of snow and ice,\nsusceptibility to falling into snowball states might be a generic feature of\nwater-rich planets with the capacity to host life. This paper has two main\nthrusts. First, we revisit one-dimensional energy balance climate models as\ntools for probing possible climates of exoplanets, investigate the dimensional\nscaling of such models, and introduce a simple algorithm to treat the melting\nof the ice layer on a globally-frozen planet. We show that if a terrestrial\nplanet undergoes Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity that are of\ngreat enough magnitude, it could melt out of a snowball state. Second, we\nexamine the kinds of variations of eccentricity that a terrestrial planet might\nexperience due to the gravitational influence of a giant companion. We show\nthat a giant planet on a sufficiently eccentric orbit can excite extreme\neccentricity oscillations in the orbit of a habitable terrestrial planet. More\ngenerally, these two results demonstrate that the longterm habitability (and\nastronomical observables) of a terrestrial planet can depend on the detailed\narchitecture of the planetary system in which it resides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 21:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 17:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Anisotropic outflows follow the path\nof least resistance and thus travel preferentially into low-density regions,\naway from cosmological structures where galaxies form. These anisotropic\noutflows are less likely to overlap with one another, or to hit pre-galactic\ncollapsing halos and strip them of their gas, preventing a galaxy from forming.\nGoing from 180 deg to 60 deg, the number of galaxies that actually form\ndoubles, producing twice as many outflows, and these outflows overlap to a\nlesser extent. As a result, the metal volume filling factor of the IGM goes\nfrom 8% for isotropic outflows up to 28% for anisotropic ones. High density\nregions are more efficiently enriched than low density ones (~80% compared to\n~20% by volume), even though most enriched regions are low densities.\nIncreasing the anisotropy of outflows increases the extent of enrichment at all\ndensities, low and high. This is in part because anisotropic outflows are more\nnumerous. When this effect is factored-out, we find that the probability a\ngalaxy will enrich systems at densities up to 10 rho_mean is higher for\nincreasingly anisotropic outflows. This is an effect of the dynamical evolution\nof the IGM.

The central quantity is the transverse spin\nsusceptibility, from which the complete excitation spectrum, including\nsingle-particle spin-flip Stoner excitations and collective spin-wave modes,\ncan be obtained. The susceptibility is derived from many-body perturbation\ntheory and includes dynamic correlation through a summation over ladder\ndiagrams that describe the coupling of electrons and holes with opposite spins.\nIn contrast to earlier studies, we do not use a model potential with adjustable\nparameters for the electron-hole interaction but employ the random-phase\napproximation. To reduce the numerical cost for the calculation of the\nfour-point scattering matrix we perform a projection onto maximally localized\nWannier functions, which allows us to truncate the matrix efficiently by\nexploiting the short spatial range of electronic correlation in the partially\nfilled d or f orbitals. Our implementation is based on the FLAPW method.\nStarting from a ground-state calculation within the LSDA, we first analyze the\nmatrix elements of the screened Coulomb potential in the Wannier basis for the\n3d transition-metal series. In particular, we discuss the differences between a\nconstrained nonmagnetic and a proper spin-polarized treatment for the\nferromagnets Fe, Co, and Ni. The spectrum of single-particle and collective\nspin excitations in fcc Ni is then studied in detail. The calculated spin-wave\ndispersion is in good overall agreement with experimental data and contains\nboth an acoustic and an optical branch for intermediate wave vectors along the\n[100] direction. In addition, we find evidence for a similar double-peak\nstructure in the spectral function along the [111] direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 22:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}

The olfactory code\ncarried by the mitral cells is sparser than the inputs that they receive. In\nthis study we analyze the mechanisms and functional significance of sparse\nolfactory codes. We consider a model of olfactory bulb containing populations\nof excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells. We argue that sparse codes\nmay emerge as a result of self organization in the network leading to the\nprecise balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided\nby the granule cells. We propose a novel role for the olfactory granule cells.\nWe show that these cells can build representations of odorant stimuli that are\nnot fully accurate.

We simulate\nthe effect of extra mixing on the FGB by setting the composition of the\nenvelope to that observed in low-mass FGB stars, and then evolve the models to\nthe tip of the AGB. The inclusion of FGB extra mixing compositional changes has\na strong effect on the C and N abundance in our AGB models, leading to\ncompositions consistent with those measured in Galactic C-rich stars. The\ncomposition of the models is also consistent with C abundances measured in\nmainstream silicon carbide grains. While our models cover the range of C\nabundances measured in C stars in NGC 1846, we cannot simultaneously match the\ncomposition of the O and C-rich stars.

It provides a model-independent\nformalism for connecting lattice simulation results at finite volume and a\nvariety of quark masses to the physical world. The asymptotic nature of the\nchiral expansion places the focus on the first few terms of the expansion.\nThus, knowledge of the power-counting regime (PCR) of chiral effective field\ntheory, where higher-order terms of the expansion may be regarded as\nnegligible, is as important as knowledge of the expansion itself. Through the\nconsideration of a variety of renormalization schemes and associated\nparameters, techniques to identify the PCR where results are independent of the\nrenormalization scheme are established. The nucleon mass is considered as a\nbenchmark for illustrating this general approach. Because the PCR is small, the\nnumerical simulation results are also examined to search for the possible\npresence of an intrinsic scale which may be used in a nonperturbative manner to\ndescribe lattice simulation results outside of the PCR.

There remains an issue of quantizing time, however,\nthe idea is simple and it provides an interesting interplay of various ideas in\nmathematics and physics. Shedding some light on such an interplay is the main\ntheme of this dissertation. The dissertation roughly separates into two parts.\nIn the first part, we consider a mathematical aspect of fuzzy spaces, namely,\ntheir construction. We begin with a review of the construction of fuzzy complex\nprojective spaces CP^k (k=1,2,...) in relation to geometric quantization. We\nthen present the construction of fuzzy S^4, utilizing the fact that CP^3 is an\nS^2 bundle over S^4. This method is also applicable to the case of fuzzy S^8.\nIn the second part, we consider applications of fuzzy spaces to physics. We\nfirst consider gravitational theories on fuzzy spaces, anticipating that they\nmay offer a novel way of regularizing spacetime dynamics. Particularly we\nobtain actions for gravity on fuzzy S^2 and fuzzy CP^2. We also discuss\napplication to M(atrix) theory. Introducing extra potentials, we show that the\ntheory has new brane solutions whose transverse directions are described by\nfuzzy S^4 and fuzzy CP^3. The extra potentials can be interpreted as fuzzy\nversions of differential forms or fluxes, which enable us to discuss\ncompactification models of M(atrix) theory. Compactification down to fuzzy S^4\nis discussed and a physically interesting matrix model in four-dimensions is\nproposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 08:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 19:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-03"}

In this paper, we examine in\ndetail the post-impulsive-phase acceleration of a CME in the outer corona,\nwhich is the phase of evolution immediately following the main impulsive\nacceleration of the CME; this phase is believed to correspond to the decay\nphase of the associated flare. This observational study is based on a\nstatistical sample of 247 CMEs that are associated with M- and X-class GOES\nsoft X-ray flares from 1996 to 2006. We find that, from many examples of\nevents, the CMEs associated with flares with long-decay time (or so-called\nlong-duration flares) tend to have positive post-impulsive-phase acceleration,\neven though some of them have already obtained a high speed at the end of the\nimpulsive acceleration but do not show a deceleration expected from the\naerodynamic dragging of the background solar wind. On the other hand, the CMEs\nassociated with flares of short-decay time tend to have significant\ndeceleration. In the scattering plot of all events, there is a weak correlation\nbetween CME post-impulsive-phase acceleration and flare decay time. The CMEs\ndeviated from the general trend are mostly slow or weak ones associated with\nflares of short-decay time; the deviation is caused by the relatively stronger\nsolar wind dragging force for these events. The implications of our results on\nCME dynamics and CME-flare relations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 10:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

There existed frequent filament\nactivities and EUV jets prior to the CME eruption for a few days. These\nactivities were probably caused by the magnetic reconnection in the lower\natmosphere driven by photospheric convergence motions, which were evident in\nthe sequence of magnetogram images from MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) onboard\nSOHO. The slow low-layer magnetic reconnection may be responsible for the\nstorage of magnetic free energy in the corona and the formation of a sigmoidal\ncore field or a flux rope leading to the eventual eruption. The occurrence of\nEUV brightenings in the sigmoidal core field prior to the rise of the flux rope\nimplies that the eruption was triggered by the inner tether-cutting\nreconnection, but not the external breakout reconnection. During the period of\nimpulsive acceleration, the time profile of the CME acceleration in the inner\ncorona is found to be consistent with the time profile of the reconnection\nelectric field inferred from the footpoint separation and the RHESSI 15-25 keV\nHXR flux curve of the associated flare. The full evolution of this CME can be\ndescribed in four distinct phases: the build-up phase, initiation phase, main\nacceleration phase, and propagation phase. The physical properties and the\ntransition between these phases are discussed, in an attempt to provide a\nglobal picture of CME dynamic evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 10:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Protein folding is a stochastic\nprocess by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional 3D\nstructure from random coil. The process involves an intricate interplay between\nglobal geometry and local structure, and each protein seems to present special\nproblems. We introduce CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk), a model of\nprotein folding that combines the features of self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the\nMonte Carlo method. In this model, the unfolded protein chain is treated as a\nrandom coil described by SAW. Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and\nother interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account\nby imposing conditions on SAW. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a\ngeneralized Langevin equation. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities\nof the model, we consider several examples, including helix formation, elastic\nproperties, and the transition in the folding of myoglobin. From the CSAW\nsimulation and physical arguments, we find a universal elastic energy for\nproteins, which depends only on the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ and the residue\nnumber $N$. The elastic energy gives rise to scaling laws $R_{g}\\sim N^{\\nu}$\nin different regions with exponents $\\nu =3/5,3/7,2/5$, consistent with the\nobserved unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively.

We find in general\ngood agreement with other surveys and the isochrones, supporting the high\nquality of our catalogue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 15:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The optically brightest stars in the universe, blue\nsupergiants of spectral A and B, are unique tools for these purposes. With\nabsolute visual magnitudes up to M_V = -9.5 they are the ideal to obtain\naccurate quantitative information about galaxies through the powerful modern\nmethods of quantitative stellar spectroscopy. The spectral analyis of\nindividual blue supergiant targets provides invaluable information about\nchemical abundances and abundance gradients, which is more comprehensive than\nthe one obtained from HII regions, as it includes additional atomic species,\nand which is also more accurate, since it avoids the systematic uncertainties\ninherent in the strong line studies usually applied to the HII regions of\nspiral galaxies beyond the Local Group. Simultaneously, the spectral analysis\nyields stellar parameters and interstellar extinction for each individual\nsupergiant target, which provides an alternative very accurate way to determine\nextragalactic distances through a newly developed method, called the\nFlux-weighted Gravity - Luminosity Relationship (FGLR). With the present\ngeneration of 10m-class telescopes these spectroscopic studies can reach out to\ndistances of 10 Mpc. The new generation of 30m-class will allow to extend this\nwork out to 30 Mpc, a substantial volume of the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2010 22:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
