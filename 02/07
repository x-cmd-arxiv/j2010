We present a basic physical picture which shows why\nall five uncommon properties are causally connected. Most novae do not have\nadequate accretion for continuous hydrogen burning, but some can achieve this\nif the companion star is nearby (with short orbital period) and a magnetic\nfield channels the matter onto a small area on the white dwarf so as to produce\na locally high accretion rate. The resultant supersoft flux irradiates the\ncompanion star and drives a higher accretion rate (with a brighter\npost-eruption phase), which serves to keep the hydrogen burning and the\nsupersoft flux going. The feedback loop cannot be perfectly self-sustaining, so\nthe supersoft flux will decline over time, forcing a decline in the accretion\nrate and the system brightness.

This last one is taken to suggest that the problems that arise for\ncertain interpretations of quantum mechanics are not limited to realist\ninterpretations only, but also affect certain instrumentalist interpretations.\n  It is argued that one may arrive at a more satisfying interpretation of\nquantum mechanics if one adopts a logic that seems more compatible with the\ninstrumentalist viewpoint namely, intuitionistic logic. The motivations for\nadopting this form of logic rather than classical logic or quantum logic are\nlinked to some of the philosophical ideas of Bohr.

Because quantum interference between\nindependent pathways to the same target state occurs only when the independent\npathways are indistinguishable, it is first shown that creating useful\ncoherence (as defined in the paper) between nondegenerate states of a molecule\nfor subsequent quantum interference manipulation cannot be achieved by\ncollisions between atoms or molecules that are prepared in momentum and energy\neigenstates.

Using a particular coherent control scenario, it is shown that\nthis coherence transfer and the subsequent coherent phase control can be\nreadily realized by the most classical states of light, i.e., coherent states\nof light. It is further demonstrated that quantum states of light may suppress\nthe extent of phase-sensitive coherent control by leaking out some which-way\ninformation while \"incoherent interference control\" scenarios proposed in the\nliterature have automatically ensured the indistinguishability of multiple\nexcitation pathways. The possibility of quantum coherence in photodissociation\nproduct states is also understood in terms of the disentanglement between\nphotodissociation fragments.

Halpern and\nR. Pass in classical strategic games. For many games of interest, this new\nsolution concept provides solutions that are judged more reasonable than\nsolutions offered by traditional game concepts -- such as Nash equilibrium --.\nAlthough computing iterated regret on explicit matrix game is conceptually and\ncomputationally easy, nothing is known about computing the iterated regret on\ngames whose matrices are defined implicitly using game tree, game DAG or, more\ngenerally game graphs. In this paper, we investigate iterated regret\nminimization for infinite duration two-player quantitative non-zero sum games\nplayed on graphs.\n  We consider reachability objectives that are not necessarily antagonist.\nEdges are weighted by integers -- one for each player --, and the payoffs are\ndefined by the sum of the weights along the paths. Depending on the class of\ngraphs, we give either polynomial or pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to\ncompute a strategy that minimizes the regret for a fixed player. We finally\ngive algorithms to compute the strategies of the two players that minimize the\niterated regret for trees, and for graphs with strictly positive weights only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2010 14:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 16:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 16:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
