Factorization for the\nformer type of process gives rise to a soft function that depends on timelike\nmomenta, whereas the soft function for the latter type depends on null momenta.\nWe derive in soft-collinear effective theory a factorization theorem that\nallows for an arbitrary number of jets, where the jets are defined with respect\nto a jet algorithm, together with any number of non-strongly interacting\nparticles. We find the soft function in general depends on the null components\nof the soft momenta inside the jets and on a timelike component of the soft\nmomentum outside of the jets. This generalizes and interpolates between the\nsoft functions for the cases of no jets and one inclusive jet. We verify\nconsistency of our factorization theorem to order alpha_s for any number of\njets. While in this paper we demonstrate consistency only near the hadronic\nendpoint, we keep the kinematics general enough (in particular allowing for\nnonzero boost) to allow for an extension to partonic threshold resummation away\nfrom the hadronic endpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 20:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 01:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 19:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Using the numerical\nrenormalization group for the particle-hole symmetric case, we study the\nquantum conductance g as a function of the inter-site hopping td. The\ninteracting region, which is perfectly reflecting when td -> 0 or td ->\ninfinity, becomes perfectly transmitting if td takes an intermediate value\n\\tau(U,tc) which defines the characteristic energy of this interacting model.\nWhen td < tc sqrt(U), g is given by a universal function of the dimensionless\nratio X=td/\\tau.

A total\nof 108 associated pairs of associated HI and WMAP features have now been\ncataloged using HI data mapped in 2 km/s intervals and these pairs show a\ntypical offset of 0.8 degrees. A large-scale statistical test for a direct\nassociation is carried out that casts little additional light on whether the\nthese small offsets are merely coincidental or carry information. To pursue the\nissue further, the nature of several of the features within the foreground HI\nmost closely associated with WMAP structure are examined in detail and it is\nshown that the cross-correlation coefficient for well-matched pairs of\nstructures is of order unity. It is shown that free-free emission from\nelectrons in unresolved density enhancements in interstellar space could\ntheoretically produce high-frequency radio continuum radiation at the levels\nobserved by WMAP and that such emission will appear nearly flat across the WMAP\nfrequency range. Evidence for such structure in the interstellar medium already\nexists in the literature. Until higher angular resolution observations of the\nhigh-frequency continuum emission structure as well as the apparently\nassociated HI structure become available, it may be difficult to rule out the\npossibility that some if not all the small-scale structure usually attributed\nto the cosmic microwave background may have a galactic origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 17:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\ndata have already been used by us in several studies. With this paper, we make\nall these data accessible to the scientific community for future studies on\ndifferent topics. Methods: We performed spectroscopic observations with echelle\nspectrographs to cover the entirety of the optical spectral range\nsimultaneously. Standard data reduction was performed with the IRAF ECHELLE\npackage. We applied the spectral subtraction technique to reveal chromospheric\nemission in the stars of the sample. The equivalent width of chromospheric\nemission lines was measured in the subtracted spectra and then converted to\nfluxes using equivalent width-flux relationships. Radial and rotational\nvelocities were determined by the cross-correlation technique. Kinematics,\nequivalent widths of the lithium line 6707.8 angstroms and spectral types were\nalso determined. Results: A catalog of spectroscopic data is compiled: radial\nand rotational velocities, space motion, equivalent widths of optical\nchromospheric activity indicators from Ca II H & K to the calcium infrared\ntriplet and the lithium line in 6708 angstroms. Fluxes in the chromospheric\nemission lines and R'HK are also determined for each observation of star in the\nsample. We used these data to investigate the emission levels of our stars.

Many of the problems result from medium\ncontention at the MAC layer. In this paper, I first illustrate that severe\nmedium contention and congestion are intimately coupled, and TCP s congestion\ncontrol algorithm becomes too coarse in its granularity, causing throughput\ninstability and excessively long delay. Further, we illustrate TCP s severe\nunfairness problem due to the medium contention and the tradeoff between\naggregate throughput and fairness.

In this protocol, each forwarding node along a traffic flow\nexercises the internode and intranode fair resource allocation and determines\nthe MAC layer feedback accordingly. The endtoend feedback, which is ultimately\ndetermined by the bottleneck node along the flow, is carried back to the source\nto control its sending rate. Extensive simulations show that WCCP significantly\noutperforms traditional TCP in terms of channel utilization, delay, and\nfairness, and eliminates the starvation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 19:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-09"}

IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination\nFunction (DCF) suffers from a common problem in erroneous channel. They cannot\ndistinguish noise lost packets from collision lost packets. In both situations\na station does not receive its ACK and doubles the CW to reduce further packet\ncollisions.

This paper is divided into two parts, which are\nclosely related to each other. In the first part, we discuss the statistical\nmechanical model of crystal melting counting BPS states. Each of the BPS state\ncontributing to the BPS index is in one-to-one correspondence with a\nconfiguration of a molten crystal, and the statistical partition function of\nthe melting crystal gives the BPS partition function. We also show that smooth\ngeometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold emerges in the thermodynamic limit of the\ncrystal. This suggests a remarkable interpretation that an atom in the crystal\nis a discretization of the classical geometry, giving an important clue as to\nthe geometry at the Planck scale.In the second part we discuss the wall\ncrossing phenomena. Wall crossing phenomena states that the BPS index depends\non the value of the moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold, and jumps along real\ncodimension one subspaces in the moduli space. We show that by using type\nIIA/M-theory duality, we can provide a simple and an intuitive derivation of\nthe wall crossing phenomena, furthermore clarifying the connection with the\ntopological string theory. This derivation is consistent with another\nderivation from the wall crossing formula, motivated by multi-centered BPS\nextremal black holes.

The front-side emission is affected\nby only mild dispersion (10's of rad/m2) from the thermal plasma in the galaxy\nhalo, while the back-side emission is affected by additional strong dispersion\n(100's of rad/m2) from an axisymmetric spiral field in the galaxy mid-plane.\nThe field topology in the upper halo of galaxies is a mix of two distinct\ntypes: a simple extension of the axisymmetric spiral quadrupole field of the\nthick disk and a radially directed dipole field. The dipole component might be\na manifestation of (1) a circumnuclear, bipolar outflow, (2) an in situ\ngenerated dipole field, or (3) evidence of a non-stationary global halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 05:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 00:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The originality\nof our approach is that instead of using traditional bases of functions, it\nrelies on the basis of eigenmodes of the dissipation operator, which represents\nviscous and Joule dissipation. We apply this idea to the simple case of a\nperiodic domain in the three directions of space, with an homogeneous magnetic\nfield in the $\\mathbf e_z$ direction. The basis is then still as subset of the\nFourier space, but ordered by growing linear decay rate $|\\lambda|$ (\\emph{i.e}\naccording to the \\emph{least dissipative modes}). We show that because the\nlines of constant energy tend to follow those of constant $|\\lambda|$ in the\nFourier space, the scaling for the the smallest scales $|\\lambda^{\\rm max}|$ in\na forced flow can be expressed using this single parameter, as a function of\nthe Reynolds number as $\\sqrt{|\\lambda^{\\rm max}|}/(2\\pi k_f)\\simeq\n0.5\\Rey^{1/2}$, where $k_f$ is the forcing wavelength, or as a function of the\nGrashof number $\\Gr_f$, which gives a non-dimensional measure of the forcing,\nas $|\\lambda^{\\rm max}|^{1/2}/(2\\pi k_f)\\simeq 0.47\\Gr_f^{0.20}$. This scaling\nis also found consistent with heuristic scalings, and which we are able to\nnumerically quantify as $k_\\perp^{\\rm max}/k_f\\simeq 0.5 \\Rey^{1/2}$ and\n$k_z^{\\rm max}/k_f\\simeq 0.8k_f \\Rey/Ha$. Finally, we show that the set of\nleast dissipative modes gives a relevant prediction for the scale of the first\nthree-dimensional structure to appear in a forced, initially two-dimensional\nturbulent flow. This completes our numerical demonstration that the least\ndissipative modes can be used to simulate both two- and three-dimensional\nlow-Rm MHD flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 11:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-15"}

We show that, with respect to\nnatural notions of \\emph{observation}, any semantics based on\n\\emph{extensional} functions is necessarily unsound; in contrast, we show that\nthe higher order version of \\emph{CRWL}, a well-known existing semantic\nframework for functional logic programming, based on an \\emph{intensional} view\nof functions, turns out to be fully abstract and compositional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 12:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

Due to the\nwide WLAN deployment, WLAN localization provides ubiquitous coverage and adds\nto the value of the wireless network by providing the location of its users\nwithout using any additional hardware. However, WLAN localization systems\nusually require constructing a radio map, which is a major barrier of WLAN\nlocalization systems' deployment. The radio map stores information about the\nsignal strength from different signal strength streams at selected locations in\nthe site of interest. Typical construction of a radio map involves measurements\nand calibrations making it a tedious and time-consuming operation. In this\npaper, we present the AROMA system that automatically constructs accurate\nactive and passive radio maps for both device-based and device-free WLAN\nlocalization systems. AROMA has three main goals: high accuracy, low\ncomputational requirements, and minimum user overhead. To achieve high\naccuracy, AROMA uses 3D ray tracing enhanced with the uniform theory of\ndiffraction (UTD) to model the electric field behavior and the human shadowing\neffect. AROMA also automates a number of routine tasks, such as importing\nbuilding models and automatic sampling of the area of interest, to reduce the\nuser's overhead. Finally, AROMA uses a number of optimization techniques to\nreduce the computational requirements. We present our system architecture and\ndescribe the details of its different components that allow AROMA to achieve\nits goals. We evaluate AROMA in two different testbeds. Our experiments show\nthat the predicted signal strength differs from the measurements by a maximum\naverage absolute error of 3.18 dBm achieving a maximum localization error of\n2.44m for both the device-based and device-free cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 13:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-10"}

This fact combined with the periodicity with which\nthe eclipses occur can be used to detect the companion. Given a sufficient\nprecision of the times of eclipses, the eclipse timing can be employed to\ndetect substellar or even planetary mass companions.\n  The main goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of the photometry\nbased eclipse timing of binary stars as a method of detecting circumbinary\nplanets. In the models we assume that the companion orbits a binary star in a\ncircular Keplerian orbit. We analyze both the space and ground based photometry\ncases.

Detection of\ngravitational waves will open a new window on the Universe enabling direct\ndetection of systems such as binary black holes for the first time. In the\nfirst Chapter we show how gravitational waves are derived from Einstein's\nGeneral theory of Relativity and discuss the emission of gravitational waves\nfrom inspiraling binaries and how this radiation may be detected using laser\ninterferometers. Around two thirds of stars inhabit binary systems. As they\norbit each other they will emit both energy and angular momentum in the form of\ngravitational waves which will inevitably lead to their inspiral and eventual\nmerger. To date, searches for gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral\nof binary systems have concentrated on systems with non-spinning components. In\nChapter 2 we detail the first dedicated search for binaries consisting of\nspinning stellar mass compact objects.

At each step, an individual can decide if it\nchanges groups or interact on its opinion with one of its internal or external\nneighbour. If it decides to look at the group level, it changes groups if its\nopinion is far from the average of its group from more than a threshold. If it\nis the case, it joins the group which has proportionally the closest average\nopinion from its. If it decides to interact with one of its neighbour, it\nbecomes closer in opinion to it when its opinion and the one of the\nselected-to-interact neighbour are less distant from the threshold. From the\nstudy of this coupled model, we discover some surprising behaviours compared to\nthe known behaviour of the Deffuant bounded confidence model(BC): The coupled\nmodel exhibits a total consensus for an threshold value lower than the BC\nmodel; the distribution of sizes of the groups changes: some groups become\nlarger while other decrease in size, sometimes until containing only one\nindividual; from the point of view of the groups, the consensus remains for a\nlarge set of threshold values while, looking at the population level, there are\na lot of opinion clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2010 15:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 14:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}
