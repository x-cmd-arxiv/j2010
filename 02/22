The phase diagram is\nthen used as a point of departure for a pedagogical review of various quantum\nphases and phase transitions of insulators, superconductors, and metals. The\nbond operator method is used to describe the transition of dimerized\nantiferromagnetic insulators between magnetically ordered states and spin-gap\nstates. The Schwinger boson method is applied to frustrated square lattice\nantiferromagnets: phase diagrams containing collinear and spirally ordered\nmagnetic states, Z_2 spin liquids, and valence bond solids are presented, and\ndescribed by an effective gauge theory of spinons. Insights from these theories\nof insulators are then applied to a variety of symmetry breaking transitions in\nd-wave superconductors. The latter systems also contain fermionic\nquasiparticles with a massless Dirac spectrum, and their influence on the order\nparameter fluctuations and quantum criticality is carefully discussed. I\nconclude with an introduction to strong coupling problems associated with\nsymmetry breaking transitions in two-dimensional metals, where the order\nparameter fluctuations couple to a gapless line of fermionic excitations along\nthe Fermi surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 12:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 09:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 09:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2011 19:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-25"}

In the case of the cubic\nmatrix model, we give explicit expressions for the ring of non-holomorphic\nmodular objects that are needed to express all closed matrix model amplitudes.\nThis allows us to integrate the holomorphic anomaly equation up to holomorphic\nmodular terms that we fix by the gap condition up to genus four. There is an\none-dimensional submanifold of the moduli space in which the spectral curve\nbecomes the Seiberg--Witten curve and the ring reduces to the non-holomorphic\nmodular ring of the group $\\Gamma(2)$. On that submanifold, the gap conditions\ncompletely fix the holomorphic ambiguity and the model can be solved explicitly\nto very high genus. We use these results to make precision tests of the\nconnection between the large order behavior of the 1/N expansion and\nnon-perturbative effects due to instantons.

The presence of\nthe spin in the junction provides different transmission amplitudes for spin-up\nand spin-down quasiparticles as well as a time-dependent spin-flip transmission\nterm. For a phase biased junction, we show that a steady-state superconducting\ncharge current flows through the junction and that an out-of-equilibrium\ncircularly polarized spin current, of frequency $\\Omega$, is emitted in the\nleads. Detailed understanding of the charge and spin currents is obtained in\nthe entire parameter range. In the adiabatic regime, $\\hbar \\Omega \\ll 2\\Delta$\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the superconducting gap, and for high transparencies of the\njunction, a strong suppression of the current takes place around $\\vp \\approx\n0$ due to an abrupt change in the occupation of the Andreev bound-states. At\nhigher values of the phase and/or precession frequency, extended\n(quasi-particle like) states compete with the bound-states in order to carry\nthe current. Well below the superconducting transition, these results are shown\nto be weakly affected by the back-action of the spin current on the dynamics of\nthe precessing spin. Indeed, we show that the Gilbert damping due to the\nquasi-particle spin current is strongly suppressed at low-temperatures, which\ngoes along with a shift of the precession frequency due to the condensate.

Boundary data for the gravitational field and a\nscalar field are posed on an initial space-like hypersurface $\\Sigma_I$ and a\nfinal surface $\\Sigma_F$. These asymptotically-flat 3-surfaces are separated by\na Lorentzian proper-time interval $T$, measured at spatial infinity.

Their nonlinear evolution drives\npressure anisotropies towards marginal stability, controlled by the plasma beta\n\\beta_i. Here this nonlinear evolution is worked out for the simplest\nanalytically tractable example - the parallel firehose instability. In the\nnonlinear regime, both analytical theory and the numerical solution predict\nsecular growth of magnetic fluctuations.

During the two Chandra observations, 17P was producing at least 100 times\nmore water than 8P but was 2.2 times further away from the Sun. Also, 17P is\nthe first comet observed at high latitude (+19.1 degrees) during solar minimum,\nwhile 8P was observed at a lower solar latitude (3.4 degrees). The X-ray\nspectrum of 17P is unusually soft with little significant emission at energies\nabove 500 eV. Depending on our choice of background, we derive a 300 to 1000 eV\nflux of 0.5 to 4.5 x 10^-13 ergs/cm2/sec, with over 90% of the emission in the\n300 to 400 eV range.

In\nthis case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, as\ncompared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a GIRF. In\naddition, other physical processes related to a non-linear evolution of the\ngravitational field could lead to a similar scenario.

We give a\ncomprising overview of the behavior of several membrane characteristics, such\nas the area per lipid, the monolayer overlap, the nematic order, and pressure\nprofiles. Both the low-temperature regime, where the membranes are in a gel\nphase, and the high-temperature regime, where they are in the fluid phase, are\nconsidered. In the gel state, the membrane is hardly influenced by tension. In\nthe fluid state, high tensions lead to structural changes in the membrane,\nwhich result in different compressibility regimes. The ripple state, which is\nfound at tension zero in the transition regime between the fluid and the gel\nphase, disappears under tension and gives way to an interdigitated phase.

It has been posited that dust in the early Universe\nmust be different from dust at lower z. To date two reports directly support\nthis contention, one of which is based on the spectral shape of GRB 050904 at z\n= 6.295. Aims: We reinvestigate the afterglow to understand dust at high z. We\naddress the claimed evidence for unusual (SN-origin) dust in its host galaxy by\nsimultaneously examining the X-ray and optical/NIR spectrophotometric data.\nMethods: We derive the intrinsic SED of the afterglow at 0.47, 1.25 and 3.4\ndays, by re-reducing the Swift X-ray data, the 1.25 days FORS2 z-Gunn\nphotometric data, the spectroscopic and z'-band photometric data at ~3 days\nfrom the Subaru telescope, as well as the critical UKIRT Z-band photometry at\n0.47 days, upon which the claim of dust detection largely relies. Results: We\nfind no evidence of dust extinction in the SED. We compute flux densities at\nlambda_rest = 1250 AA directly from the observed counts at all epochs. In the\nearliest epoch, 0.47 days, the Z-band suppression is found to be smaller (0.3\n+- 0.2 mag) than previously reported and statistically insignificant (<1.5\nsigma). Furthermore we find that the photometry of this band is unstable and\ndifficult to calibrate. Conclusions: From the afterglow SED we demonstrate that\nthere is no evidence for dust extinction -- the SED at all times can be\nreproduced without dust, and at 1.25 days in particular, significant extinction\ncan be excluded, with A(3000 AA) < 0.27 mag at 95% confidence using the SN-type\nextinction curve. We conclude that there is no evidence of any extinction in\nthe afterglow of GRB 050904 and that the presence of SN-origin dust in the host\nof GRB 050904 must be viewed skeptically.

We consider agents' behavior at short\ntime scales, in which the contact network is formed by disconnected cliques of\ndifferent sizes. At each time a random agent can make a transition from being\nisolated to being part of a group, or vice-versa. Different distributions of\ncontact times and inter-contact times between individuals are obtained by\nconsidering transition probabilities with memory effects, i.e. the transition\nprobabilities for each agent depend both on its state (isolated or interacting)\nand on the time elapsed since the last change of state. The model lends itself\nto analytical and numerical investigations.

Cooling of the hot tenuous gas phase\nfeeds the cold gas phase. Stars are formed out of molecular gas with a given\nefficiency, which scales with the dynamical time of the cold phase. Our\nprescription for star formation is not based on imposing the Schmidt-Kennicutt\nrelation, which is instead naturally produced by MUPPI. Energy from supernova\nexplosions is deposited partly into the hot phase of the gas particles, and\npartly to that of neighboring particles. Mass and energy flows among the\ndifferent phases of each particle are described by a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations which we explicitly integrate for each gas particle,\ninstead of relying on equilibrium solutions.
