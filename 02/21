Due to the presence of\nphonons the molecule level position ($\\epsilon_d$) and the electron-electron\ninteraction ($U$) undergo a \\emph{polaronic shift} which affects dramatically\nthe electronic transport through the molecular junction. When the\nelectron-phonon interaction is weak the linear conductance presents Fano-line\nshapes as long as the direct channel between the electrodes is opened. The\nobserved Fano resonances in the linear conductance are originated from the\ninterference between the spin Kondo state and the direct path. For strong\nenough electron-phonon interaction, the electron-electron interaction is\nrenormalized towards negative values, {\\it i.e.} becomes effectively\nattractive. This scenario favors fluctuations between the empty and doubly\noccupied charge states and therefore promotes a charge Kondo effect. However,\nthe direct path between the contacts breaks the electron-hole symmetry which\ncan efficiently suppress this charge Kondo effect. Nevertheless, we show that a\nproper tuning of the gate voltage is able to revive the Kondo resonance. Our\nresults are obtained by using the Numerical Renormalization approximation to\ncompute the electronic spectral function and the linear conductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2010 18:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The ultrametric $d_{u}$ is defined using the\nconcept of {\\em relative infinitesimals} and an {\\em inversion} rule. The\nassociated (infinitesimal) valuation which turns out to be both scale and\nreparametrisation invariant, is identified with the Cantor function associated\nwith a Cantor set $\\tilde C$ where the relative infinitesimals are supposed to\nlive in. These ultrametrics are both metrically as well as topologically\ninequivalent compared to the topology induced by the usual metric. Every point\nof the original Cantor set $C$ is identified with the closure of the set of\ngaps of $\\tilde C$. The increments on such an ultrametric space is accomplished\nby following the inversion rule. As a consequence, Cantor functions are\nreinterpretd as (every where) locally constant on these extended ultrametric\nspaces. An interesting phenomenon, called {\\em growth of measure}, is studied\non such an ultrametric space. Using the reparametrisation invariance of the\nvaluation it is shown how the scale factors of a Lebesgue measure zero Cantor\nset might get {\\em deformed} leading to a {\\em deformed} Cantor set with a\npositive measure. The definition of a new {\\em valuated exponent} is introduced\nwhich is shown to yield the fatness exponent in the case of a positive measure\n(fat) Cantor set. However, the valuated exponent can also be used to\ndistinguish Cantor sets with identical Hausdorff dimension and thickness.

In order to solve the puzzle, we\nfirst investigate the observed properties of 31 limb CMEs that display clearly\nloop-shaped frontal loops. The observational results show a strong tendency\nthat slower CMEs are weaker in the white-light intensity. Then, we perform a\nMonte Carlo simulation of 20 000 artificial limb CMEs that have average\nvelocity of $\\sim$523 km s$^{-1}$. The Thomson scattering of these events is\ncalculated when they are assumed to be observed as limb and halo events,\nrespectively. It is found that the white-light intensity of many slow CMEs\nbecomes remarkably reduced as they turn from being viewed as a limb event to as\na halo event. When the intensity is below the background solar wind\nfluctuation, it is assumed that they would be missed by coronagraphs. The\naverage velocity of \"detectable\" halo CMEs is $\\sim$922 km s$^{-1}$, very close\nto the observed value. It also indicates that wider events are more likely to\nbe recorded. The results soundly suggest that the higher average velocity of\nhalo CMEs is due to that a majority of slow events and a part of narrow fast\nevents carrying less material are so faint that they are blended with the solar\nwind fluctuations, and therefore are not observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2010 08:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
