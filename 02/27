In this setting, TCP flows do not fully exploit the network coding\nopportunities due to their bursty behavior and due to the fact that TCP is\nagnostic to the underlying network coding. In order to improve the performance\nof TCP flows over coded wireless networks, we take the following steps. First,\nwe formulate the problem as network utility maximization and we present a\ndistributed solution. Second, mimicking the structure of the optimal solution,\nwe propose a \"network-coding aware\" queue management scheme (NCAQM) at\nintermediate nodes; we make no changes to TCP or to the MAC protocol (802.11).\nWe demonstrate, via simulation, that NCAQM significantly improves TCP\nperformance compared to TCP over baseline schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 17:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2010 18:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

This mechanism is\nnamed rotochemical heating and has previously been studied for neutron stars of\nnon-superfluid matter, finding that they reach a quasi-steady state in which\nthe rate that the spin-down modifies the equilibrium concentrations is the same\nto that of the neutrino reactions restoring the equilibrium.

Wald on geodesic motion in general relativity\ncan be generalized to classical field theories of a metric and other tensor\nfields on four-dimensional spacetime that 1) are second-order and 2) follow\nfrom a diffeomorphism-covariant Lagrangian. The approach is to consider a\none-parameter-family of solutions to the field equations satisfying certain\nassumptions designed to reflect the existence of a body whose size, mass, and\nvarious charges are simultaneously scaled to zero. (That such solutions exist\nplaces a further restriction on the class of theories to which our results\napply.) Assumptions are made only on the spacetime region outside of the body,\nso that the results apply to ordinary bodies as well as black holes. The\nworldline \"left behind\" by the shrinking, disappearing body is interpreted as\nits lowest-order motion. An equation for this worldline follows from the\n\"Bianchi identity\" for the theory, without use of any properties of the field\nequations beyond their being second-order. The form of the force law for a\ntheory therefore depends only on the ranks of its various tensor fields, with\nthe field equations relevant only for determining the charges of a particular\nbody from its exterior fields.

The morphology of supernova remnants is also expected to be\nmodified when efficient particle acceleration occurs at their shocks. Aims: The\nimpact of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities from the ejecta-dominated to the\nSedov-Taylor phase is investigated over one octant of the supernova remnant. We\nalso study the effect of efficient particle acceleration at the forward shock\non the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Methods: We modified the\nAdaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES to study with hydrodynamic numerical\nsimulations the evolution of supernova remnants in the framework of an\nexpanding reference frame. The adiabatic index of a relativistic gas between\nthe forward shock and the contact discontinuity mimics the presence of\naccelerated particles.

The frequency of multiple deflections above a given threshold\nshear value is quantified for discrete source redshifts, as well as for a set\nof sources that are broadly distributed in redshift space. In general, the\nclosest lens in projection on the sky is not the only lens for a given source.\nIn addition, ~50% of the time the closest lens is not the most important lens\nfor a given source. Compared to a naive single-deflection calculation in which\nonly the lensing due to the closest weak lens is considered, a full\nmultiple-deflection calculation yields a higher net shear for individual\nsources, as well as a higher mean tangential shear around the lens centers. The\nfull multiple-deflection calculation also shows that galaxy-galaxy lensing may\ncontribute a substantial amount to cosmic shear on small angular scales. The\ndegree to which galaxy-galaxy lensing contributes to the small-scale cosmic\nshear is, however, quite sensitive to the mass adopted for the halos of L_B*\ngalaxies.

The contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear\ndecreases rapidly with angular scale and extrapolates to zero at scales of\norder 5 arcmin.

The calculations are based on new two-dimensional\npotential energy surfaces obtained from highly correlated \\textit{ab initio}\ncalculations. Calculations of pure rotational (de)excitation cross sections of\nHCN and HNC by He were performed using the essentially exact close-coupling\nmethod.

An inverse\nscaling often arises in which measures naturally grade from logarithmic to\nlinear as one moves from small to large magnitudes, leading to observations\nthat often follow a gamma probability distribution. A gamma distribution has a\npower law shape for small magnitudes and an exponential shape for large\nmagnitudes. The two measurement scales are natural inverses connected by the\nLaplace integral transform. This inversion connects the two major scaling\npatterns commonly found in nature.

Structural & kinematic deprojection\nequations are not known for an expanding Universe, where the Hubble flow (HF)\nstretches the line-of-sight (LOS) distribution of velocities. We analyze 93\nmock relaxed clusters, built from a cosmological simulation. The stacked mock\ncluster is well fit by an m=5 Einasto DM density profile (but only out to 1.5\nvirial radii [r_v]), with velocity anisotropy (VA) close to the Mamon-Lokas\nmodel with VA radius equal to that of density slope -2. The surface density of\nFBIs is nearly flat out to r_v, while their LOS velocity distribution shows a\ndominant gaussian cluster-outskirts component and a flat field component. This\ndistribution of FBIs in projected phase space is nearly universal in mass. A\nlocal k=2.7 sigma velocity cut returns the LOS velocity dispersion profile\n(LOSVDP) expected from the NFW density and VA profiles measured in 3D. The HF\ncauses a shallower outer LOSVDP that cannot be well matched by the Einasto\nmodel for any k. After this velocity cut, FBIs still account for 23% of DM\nparticles within the VC (close to the observed fraction of cluster galaxies\nlying off the Red Sequence). The best-fit projected NFW/Einasto models\nunderestimate the 3D concentration by 6+/-6% (16+/-7%) after (before) the\nvelocity cut, unless a constant background is included in the fit. Assuming the\ncorrect mass profile, the VA profile is well recovered from the measured\nLOSVDP, with a slight bias towards more radial orbits in the outer regions.\nThese small biases are overshadowed by large cluster-cluster variations caused\nby cosmic variance.

In this paper we\npropose a transmission controller that utilizes different \"grades\" of channel\nside information to schedule packet transmissions in an optimal way, while\nmeeting a deadline constraint for all packets waiting in the transmission\nqueue. The wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markov channel.

The\ntransmission consists of two hops. The source transmits in the first hop, and\nthe relay transmits in the second hop. Each hop occupies one time slot. The\nrelay is half-duplex, and capable of decoding the message on a particular\nsubcarrier in one time slot, and re-encoding and forwarding it on a different\nsubcarrier in the next time slot. Thus each message is transmitted on a pair of\nsubcarriers in two hops. It is assumed that the destination is capable of\ncombining the signals from the source and the relay pertaining to the same\nmessage. The goal is to maximize the weighted sum rate of the system by jointly\noptimizing subcarrier pairing and power allocation on each subcarrier in each\nhop. The weighting of the rates is to take into account the fact that different\nsubcarriers may carry signals for different services. Both total and individual\npower constraints for the source and the relay are investigated. For the\nsituations where the relay does not transmit on some subcarriers because doing\nso does not improve the weighted sum rate, we further allow the source to\ntransmit new messages on these idle subcarriers. To the best of our knowledge,\nsuch a joint optimization inclusive of the destination combining has not been\ndiscussed in the literature. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer\nprogramming problem. It is then transformed to a convex optimization problem by\ncontinuous relaxation, and solved in the dual domain. Based on the optimization\nresults, algorithms to achieve feasible solutions are also proposed. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed algorithms almost achieve the optimal weighted\nsum rate, and outperform the existing methods in various channel conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2010 12:06:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 16:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This notion and its\nstudy are based on a preliminary investigation of cross-effects of functors in\na general categorical context. These also allow us to define higher categorical\ncommutators. We show that any proper subobject of an object $E$ (i.e., a kernel\nof some map on $E$ in $\\mathbb C$) admits a \"conjugation\" action of $E$,\ngeneralizing the conjugation action of $E$ on itself defined by Bourn and\nJanelidze.

It has been known, since Riemann's memoir in 1860, that\nthe distribution of prime numbers can be described by the zero-free region of\nthe Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$. This function has infinitely many zeros\nand a unique pole at $s = 1$. Those zeros at $s = -2, -4, -6, ...$ are known as\ntrivial zeros. The nontrivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ are all located in the\nso-called critical strip $0<\\Re(s) <1$. Define $\\Lambda(n) =\\log p$ whenever $n\n=p\\sp{m}$ for a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $m$, and zero\notherwise. Let $x\\ge 2$.

Knockout resilience in the dynamics of the\nremaining nodes is a sign of robustness. Here we study the effect of knockouts\nfor binary state sequences and their implementations in terms of Boolean\nthreshold networks. Beside random sequences with biologically plausible\nconstraints, we analyze the cell cycle sequence of the species Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae and the Boolean networks implementing it. Comparing with an\nappropriate null model we do not find evidence that the yeast wildtype network\nis optimized for high knockout resilience. Our notion of knockout resilience\nweakly correlates with the size of the basin of attraction, which has also been\nconsidered a measure of robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2010 15:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
