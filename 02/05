During the most recent outburst in 2008, the source showed a\ncomplete series of spectral states/transitions. The neutron star system was\nprolific in type-I X-ray bursts, and we investigate them in the context of\ncomplete outbursts evolution. A total exposure of ~ 309 ks was collected by\nRXTE during the two outbursts of IGR J17473-2721. We carried out a systematic\nsearch for type-I bursts in this data set. For each burst found, we\ninvestigated the burst profile, the peak flux, and their dependence on the\naccretion rate along the evolution of the outbursts. Eighteen type-I X-ray\nbursts were found from IGR J17473-2721: two from the outburst in 2005 and the\nother 16 from the recent outburst in 2008. Among them, 3 bursts show\nphotospheric radius expansion (PRE). The distance to the source is estimated as\n6.4 kpc with a 15% uncertainty based on the three bursts that show PRE. In the\nrecent outburst, there are 6 bursts showing up in the low/hard state prior to\nthe state transition to a high/soft state, 3 bursts at the end phase of the\nhigh/soft state, and 7 in the following low/hard state. The blackbody radius of\nthese bursts presents a variety of interesting features. We find that at the\nend of the recent outburst, the profile of the blackbody radius is\nanti-correlated with the blackbody temperature and the burst flux. The\ndurations of the type-I burst are found to correlate with the Eddington ratio\nand to have two parallel evolution groups. Along the decreasing Eddington\nratio, the burst duration decreases and ends in each group the PRE bursts\noccurred. This provides new clues to the type-I bursts in the context of\noutbursts for atoll XRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 17:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Given an n-dimensional manifold W, a topological\narbiter associates a value 0 or 1 to codimension zero submanifolds of W,\nsubject to natural topological and duality axioms. For example, there is a\nunique arbiter on $RP^2$, which reports the location of the essential 1-cycle.\nIn contrast, we show that there exists an uncountable collection of topological\narbiters in dimension 4. Families of arbiters, not induced by homology, are\nalso shown to exist in higher dimensions. The technical ingredients underlying\nthe four dimensional results are secondary obstructions to generalized\nlink-slicing problems. For classical links in the 3-sphere the construction\nrelies on the existence of nilpotent embedding obstructions in dimension 4,\nreflected in particular by the Milnor group. In higher dimensions novel\narbiters are produced using nontrivial squares in stable homotopy theory.\n  The concept of \"topological arbiter\" derives from percolation and from\n4-dimensional surgery. It is not the purpose of this paper to advance either of\nthese subjects, but rather to study the concept for its own sake. However in\nappendices we give both an application to percolation, and the current\nunderstanding of the relationship between arbiters and surgery.

This companion is ~7 magnitudes fainter than its host star in the\nH-band, and infrared imaging spanning 4.75 years over five epochs indicates\nthis companion has common proper motion with its host star. Using evolutionary\nmodels, we estimate its mass to be 0.168+/-.016 solar masses, giving a mass\nratio for this system q = 0.082. Assuming the two objects are coeval, this mass\nsuggests a M4V-M7V spectral type for the companion, which is confirmed through\nintegral field spectroscopic measurements. We see clear evidence for orbital\nmotion from this companion and are able to constrain the semi-major axis to be\ngreater than 24.9 AU, the period > 124$ yrs, and eccentricity > 0.16.\nMultiplicity studies of higher mass stars are relatively rare, and binary\ncompanions such as this one at the extreme low end of the mass ratio\ndistribution are useful additions to surveys incomplete at such a low mass\nratio. Moreover, the frequency of binary companions can help to discriminate\nbetween binary formation scenarios that predict an abundance of low-mass\ncompanions forming from the early fragmentation of a massive circumstellar\ndisk. A system such as this may provide insight into the anomalous X-ray\nemission from A stars, hypothesized to be from unseen late-type stellar\ncompanions. Indeed, we calculate that the presence of this M-dwarf companion\neasily accounts for the X-ray emission from this star detected by ROSAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background. The stellar relic of this disk is long\nlived and retains the eccentric pattern.

Alternative ways to corroborate\nnon-electromagnetic signals from coalescing neutron stars are therefore all the\nmore desirable.

The analysis is based on two-dimensional kinematic\nmaps extending out to 1.7 effective radii obtained from Keck spectroscopy, on\nlensing geometry and on stellar mass estimates obtained from multiband Hubble\nSpace Telescope imaging. The data are modelled under the assumptions of axial\nsymmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function (DF), by applying\nthe combined gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics code CAULDRON, and\nyielding high-quality constraints for an early-type galaxy at cosmological\nredshifts. Modelling the total density profile as a power-law of the form\nrho_tot ~ 1/r^{gamma}, we find that it is nearly isothermal (logarithmic slope\ngamma = 2.08^{+0.04}_{-0.02}), and quite flattened (axial ratio q =\n0.60^{+0.08}_{-0.03}). The galaxy is mildly anisotropic (delta = 0.08 +/- 0.02)\nand shows a fair amount of rotational support, in particular towards the outer\nregions. We determine a dark matter fraction lower limit of 28 per cent within\nthe effective radius. The stellar contribution to the total mass distribution\nis close to maximal for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), whereas for a\nSalpeter IMF the stellar mass exceeds the total mass within the galaxy inner\nregions. We find that the combination of a NFW dark matter halo with the\nmaximally rescaled luminous profile provides a remarkably good fit to the total\nmass distribution over a broad radial range. Our results confirm and expand the\nfindings of the SLACS survey for early-type galaxies of comparable velocity\ndispersion (sigma_SDSS = 214 +/- 11 km/s).

As a\nconsequence a divergence arises between the true evolutionary distances and the\ndifferences between pairs of taxa as inferred from available data, making the\nphylogenetic reconstruction a challenging problem. Mathematically this\ndivergence translates in a loss of additivity of the actual distances between\ntaxa. In distance-based reconstruction methods, two properties of additive\ndistances were extensively exploited as antagonist criteria to drive phylogeny\nreconstruction: on the one hand a local property of quartets, i.e., sets of\nfour taxa in a tree, the four-points condition; on the other hand a recently\nproposed formula that allows to write the tree length as a function of the\ndistances between taxa, the Pauplin's formula. Here we introduce a new\nreconstruction scheme, that exploits in a unified framework both the\nfour-points condition and the Pauplin's formula. We propose, in particular, a\nnew general class of distance-based Stochastic Local Search algorithms, which\nreduces in a limit case to the minimization of the Pauplin's length. When\ntested on artificially generated phylogenies our Stochastic Big-Quartet\nSwapping algorithmic scheme significantly outperforms state-of-art\ndistance-based algorithms in cases of deviation from additivity due to high\nrate of back mutations.

We find that the superconductivity appears near a\nquantum critical point under pressures in the range 4.7 kbar < P < 10.8 kbar.\nBoth electron correlation and superconductivity disappear in the collapsed\ntetragonal phase. A systematic study under pressure indicates that electron\ncorrelations play a vital role in forming Cooper pairs in this compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2010 02:15:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 04:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Experimental data on single hadron\nsuppression in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC energy are analyzed\nwithin the higher-twist (HT) approach to the medium modified fragmentation\nfunctions and the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) parton\nmodel.

One can then study\nthe dependence of extracted initial value of jet quenching parameter $\\hat\nq_{0}$ at initial time $\\tau_{0}$ on the bulk medium evolution. Effects of\ntransverse expansion, radial flow, phase transition and non-equilibrium\nevolution are examined.

The overall\ncontribution to jet quenching from the hadronic phase, about 22-44%, is found\nto be significant.

Such\nspace-times are usually required to be asymptotically flat (AF), and thus to\nhave a prescribed type of asymptotic. Despite all the \"reasonable\" that the\nrequirement is, it seems to be against the spirit of General Relativity where\nthe global structure of the space-time should be also considered as a variable.\nIt is shown here that, even eliminating from the definition any a priori\nreference or assumption about the asymptotic, the space-times of isolated\nbodies are unavoidably and a posteriori AF.

The color-Coulomb potential rises linearly at large\ndistances, but its determination suffers from rather large statistical\nfluctuations, due to configurations with very low values of $\\mu_0$, the lowest\neigenvalue of the Coulomb-gauge Faddeev-Popov operator. However, if one imposes\ncuts on the data, effectively leaving out configurations with very low $\\mu_0$,\nthe agreement of the potential in both sets of configurations is again\nsatisfactory, although the errorbars grow systematically as the cutoff is\neliminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2010 12:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2010 19:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2010 21:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

High-resolution and high-accuracy spectra are required\nfor verifying hydrodynamic stellar atmospheres and for resolving intergalactic\nabsorption-line structures in quasars. Even with great photon fluxes from large\ntelescopes with matching spectrometers, precise measurements of line profiles\nand wavelength positions encounter various physical, observational, and\ninstrumental limits. The analysis may be limited by astrophysical and telluric\nblends, lack of suitable lines, imprecise laboratory wavelengths, or\ninstrumental imperfections. To some extent, such limits can be pushed by\nforming averages over many similar spectral lines, thus averaging away small\nrandom blends and wavelength errors. In situations where theoretical\npredictions of lineshapes and shifts can be accurately made (e.g., hydrodynamic\nmodels of solar-type stars), the consistency between noisy observations and\ntheoretical predictions may be verified; however this is not feasible for,\ne.g., the complex of intergalactic metal lines in spectra of distant quasars,\nwhere the primary data must come from observations. To more fully resolve\nlineshapes and interpret wavelength shifts in stars and quasars alike, spectral\nresolutions on order R=300,000 or more are required; a level that is becoming\n(but is not yet) available. A grand challenge remains to design efficient\nspectrometers with resolutions approaching R=1,000,000 for the forthcoming\ngeneration of extremely large telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2010 10:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\ntheory of cosmological perturbations is modified and the relevant deformation\nparameter has the dimension of length. Gravitational perturbations of the\nscalar type can be described by a certain relativistic potential related to the\nmatter perturbations just as in general relativity. A system of differential\nequations describing the evolution of this potential and of the stress-energy\ndensity perturbations is obtained. We find that the evolution of scalar\nperturbations proceeds with a modified effective time-dependent speed of sound,\nwhich, contrary to the case of general relativity, does not vanish even at the\nmatter-dominated stage. In a broad range of values of the length parameter\ncontrolling the deformation, a specific transition from the regime of modified\ngravity to the regime of general relativity in the evolution of scalar\nperturbations takes place during the radiation domination. In this case, the\nresulting power spectrum of perturbations in radiation and dark matter is\nsuppressed on the comoving spatial scales that enter the Hubble radius before\nthis transition.

The stronger\nthe turbulence - the higher the Mach number - the more extreme the density\nfluctuations are expected to be. Numerical models predict an increase in\ndensity variance with rms Mach number of the form: sigma^{2}_{rho/rho_{0}} =\nb^{2}M^{2}, where b is a numerically-estimated parameter, and this prediction\nforms the basis of a large number of analytic models of star formation. We\nprovide an estimate of the parameter b from 13CO J=1-0 spectral line imaging\nobservations and extinction mapping of the Taurus molecular cloud, using a\nrecently developed technique that needs information contained solely in the\nprojected column density field to calculate sigma^{2}_{rho/rho_{0}}. We find b\n~ 0.48, which is consistent with typical numerical estimates, and is\ncharacteristic of turbulent driving that includes a mixture of solenoidal and\ncompressive modes. More conservatively, we constrain b to lie in the range\n0.3-0.8, depending on the influence of sub-resolution structure and the role of\ndiffuse atomic material in the column density budget.

We look for\nevidence of lensing in the SuperNova Legacy Survey 3-year data set. We\ninvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the Hubble diagram and\nthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution of\nforeground galaxies. A deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, and\nwell established mass luminosity relations are used. We find evidence of a\nlensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. The current result is limited by\nthe number of SNe, their redshift distribution, and the other sources of\nscatter in the Hubble diagram. Separating the galaxy population into a red and\na blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signal\ndetection. On the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, the\nprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the mass\nluminosity relations have little effect. We show that for the full SuperNova\nLegacy Survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia SNe and ~200\nphotometrically identified Type Ia SNe), there is an 80% probability of\ndetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2010 15:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This is one manifestation of the necessity of\nincluding a three-nucleon force in the nuclear Hamiltonian. Several models of\nthe three-nucleon force exist and are applied in the description of light\nnuclei. However, as it is discussed here, a simultaneous description of the\nthree- and four-body binding energies and the $n-d$ doublet scattering length\nseems to be problematic. Accordingly, a comparative study of some of these\nmodels is performed. In a different analysis, we study applications of the Kohn\nVariational Principle, formulated in terms of integral relations, to describe\n$N-d$ scattering processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2010 15:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
