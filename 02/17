In this note we answer these\nquestions. Firstly, for a single scalar phi, we show that the quantum field\ntheory is well behaved in the pure gravity and kinetic sectors, since the\nquantum generated corrections are small. However, the theory likely breaks down\nat ~ m_pl / xi due to scattering provided by the self-interacting potential\nlambda phi^4.

Since the Higgs doublet of the Standard Model includes\nthe Higgs boson and 3 Goldstone bosons, it falls into the latter category and\ntherefore its validity is manifestly spoiled.

A convenient expression for the density of\nparticles on cycles of length $q$ is obtained, in terms of $q$ unsymmetrised\nparticles coupled with a boson field. Using this formulation we reproduce known\nresults on the Ideal Bose Gas, Mean-Field and Perturbed Mean-Field Models,\nwhere the condensate density exactly equals the long cycle density.\n  Then we consider the Infinite-Range-Hopping Bose-Hubbard model, with and\nwithout hard-cores. For the hard-core case, we find we can disregard the\nhopping contribution of the q unsymmetrised particles to obtain an exact\nexpression for the density of particles on long cycles. It is shown that only\nthe cycle of length one contributes to the cycle density. We conclude that\nwhile the existence of a non-zero long cycle density coincides with the\noccurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation, the respective densities are not\nnecessarily equal.\n  For the case of a finite on-site repulsion, we obtain an expression for the\ncycle density by neglecting the $q$ unsymmetrised hop. Inspired by the\nApproximating Hamiltonian method we conjecture a simplified expression for the\nshort cycle density as a ratio of single-site partition functions. In the\nabsence of condensation we prove that this simplification is exact and find\nthat in this case the long-cycle density vanishes. In the presence of\ncondensation we justify this simplification when a gauge-symmetry breaking term\nis introduced in the Hamiltonian.

This model explains the origin of the tri-critical point besides\nvarious phenomena such as the quarkyonic matter and the quark-gluon liquid. The\nHagedorn mass spectrum is derived for the color-singlet quark-gluon bag with\nvarious internal structures such as the unimodular unitary, orthogonal and\ncolor-flavor locked symplectic symmetry groups. The continuous high-lying\nhadronic mass spectrum is populated at first by the unitary Hagedorn states.\nThen the spectrum turns to be dominated by the colorless orthogonal states as\nthe dilute system is heated up. Subsequently, the liquid/gas of orthogonal\nHagedorn states undergoes higher order deconfinement phase transition to\nquark-gluon plasma. Under the deconfinement phase transition process, the\ncolor-singlet states is broken badly to form the colored $SU(N_c)$ symmetry\ngroup. On the other hand, when the hadronic matter is compressed to larger\n$\\mu_{B}$ and heated up, the colorless unitary states undergoes first order\nphase transition to explosive quark-gluon plasma.

We\nhave obtained spectroscopy from LDSS-2/Magellan, VIMOS/VLT, and Hydra/CTIO from\nwhich we have measured the radial velocities of 218 known, and identified 155\nnew, GCs. The current sample of confirmed GCs in NGC 5128 is now 605 with 564\nof these having radial velocity measurements. We have performed a new kinematic\nanalysis of the GC system that extends out to 45 arcmin in galactocentric\nradius. We have examined the systemic velocity, projected rotation amplitude\nand axis, and the projected velocity dispersion of the GCs as functions of\ngalactocentric distance and metallicity. Our results indicate that the\nmetal-poor GCs have a very mild rotation signature of (26 pm 15) km/s. The\nmetal-rich GCs are rotating with a higher, though still small signature of (43\npm 15) km/s around the isophotal major axis of NGC 5128 within 15 arcmin. Their\nvelocity dispersions are consistent within the uncertainties and the profiles\nappear flat or declining within 20 arcmin.

The\nmass and mass-to-light ratios have also been estimated using the GCs as tracer\nparticles for NGC 5128. Out to a distance of 20 arcmin, we have obtained a mass\nof (5.9 pm 2.0) x 10^(11) M_(sun) and a mass-to-light ratio in the B-band of 16\nM_(sun)/L_(B,sun).

This observed\ncorrelation implies a mechanism of joint growth, but the precise physical\nprocesses responsible are a matter of some debate. Here we report on the growth\nof black holes in 400 local galactic bulges which have experienced a strong\nburst of star formation in the past 600Myr. The black holes in our sample have\ntypical masses of 10^6.5-10^7.5 solar masses, and the active nuclei have\nbolometric luminosities of order 10^42-10^44erg/s. We combine stellar continuum\nindices with H-alpha luminosities to measure a decay timescale of ~300Myr for\nthe decline in star formation after a starburst. During the first 600Myr after\na starburst, the black holes in our sample increase their mass by on-average 5%\nand the total mass of stars formed is about 1000 times the total mass accreted\nonto the black hole. This ratio is similar to the ratio of stellar to black\nhole mass observed in present-day bulges. We find that the average rate of\naccretion of matter onto the black hole rises steeply roughly 250Myr after the\nonset of the starburst. We show that our results are consistent with a simple\nmodel in which 0.5% of the mass lost by intermediate mass stars in the bulge is\naccreted by the black hole, but with a suppression in the efficiency of black\nhole growth at early times plausibly caused by supernova feedback, which is\nstronger at earlier times. We suggest this picture may be more generally\napplicable to black hole growth, and could help explain the strong correlation\nbetween bulge and black hole mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2010 21:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We\nexamined two nearby galaxies, M 83 and NGC 1313, for which a comprehensive\nstudy of the WR population exists.

Results: We find that the WC star distribution favours brighter\npixels than the WN star population. WC stars are more likely drawn from the\nsame distribution as SNe Ic than from other SN distributions, while WN stars\nshow a higher degree of association with SNe Ib. It can also not be excluded\nthat WR (especially WC) stars are related to LGRBs. Some differences between\nthe two galaxies do exist, especially in the subtype distributions, and may\nstem from differences in metallicity. Conclusions: Although a conclusive answer\nis not possible, the expectation that WR stars are the progenitors of SNe Ib/c\nand LGRBs survives this test. The trend observed between the distributions of\nWN and WC stars, as compared to those of SNe Ib and Ic, is consistent with the\ntheoretical picture that SNe Ic result from progenitors that have been stripped\nof a larger part of their envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 11:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2010 19:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

ROLES is a K-selected (22.5 < K_AB < 24.0) survey for dwarf galaxies\n[8.5<log(M*/Msun)< 9.5] at 0.89 < z < 1.15 drawn from two extremely deep fields\n(GOODS-S and MS1054-FIRES).

We present the [OII] luminosity function measured in\nROLES and find a faint end slope of alpha_faint ~ -1.5, similar to that\nmeasured at z~0.1 in the SDSS. By combining ROLES with higher mass surveys, we\nmeasure the SFRD as a function of stellar mass using [OII] (with and without\nvarious empirical corrections), and using SED-fitting to obtain the SFR from\nthe rest-frame UV luminosity for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. Our\nbest estimate of the corrected [OII]-SFRD and UV SFRD both independently show\nthat the SFRD evolves equally for galaxies of all masses between z~1 and z~0.1.\nThe exact evolution in normalisation depends on the indicator used, with the\n[OII]-based estimate showing a change of a factor of ~2.6 and the UV-based a\nfactor of ~6. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalisation\nbetween the indicators, but note that the magnitude of this uncertainty is\ncomparable to the discrepancy between indicators seen in other z~1 works. Our\nresult that the shape of the SFRD as a function of stellar mass (and hence the\nmass range of galaxies dominating the SFRD) does not evolve between z~1 and\nz~0.1 is robust to the choice of indicator.

For multi-source multicast networks, the scheme\nnaturally extends both network coding over noiseless networks by Ahlswede, Cai,\nLi, and Yeung, and compress-forward coding for the relay channel by Cover and\nEl Gamal to general discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. The scheme also\nrecovers as special cases the results on coding for wireless relay networks and\ndeterministic networks by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, and coding for wireless\nerasure networks by Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros. The scheme\ninvolves message repetition coding, relay signal compression, and simultaneous\ndecoding. Unlike previous compress--forward schemes, where independent messages\nare sent over multiple blocks, the same message is sent multiple times using\nindependent codebooks as in the network coding scheme for cyclic networks.\nFurthermore, the relays do not use Wyner--Ziv binning as in previous\ncompress-forward schemes, and each decoder performs simultaneous joint\ntypicality decoding on the received signals from all the blocks without\nexplicitly decoding the compression indices. A consequence of this new scheme\nis that achievability is proved simply and more generally without resorting to\ntime expansion to extend results for acyclic networks to networks with cycles.\nThe noisy network coding scheme is then extended to general multi-source\nnetworks by combining it with decoding techniques for interference channels.\nFor the Gaussian multicast network, noisy network coding improves the\npreviously established gap to the cutset bound.

We first derive the capacity upper bound and the achievable rates\nwith three existing schemes: Decode-and-Forward (DF), Compress-and-Forward\n(CF), and Amplify-and-Forward (AF). We present two capacity results under\nspecific noise correlation coefficients, one being achieved by DF and the other\nbeing achieved by direct link transmission (or a special case of CF). The\nchannel for the former capacity result is equivalent to the traditional\nGaussian degraded relay channel and the latter corresponds to the Gaussian\nreversely-degraded relay channel. For CF and AF schemes, we show that their\nachievable rates are strictly decreasing functions over the negative\ncorrelation coefficient. Through numerical comparisons under different channel\nsettings, we observe that although DF completely disregards the noise\ncorrelation while the other two can potentially exploit such extra information,\nnone of the three relay schemes always outperforms the others over different\ncorrelation coefficients. Moreover, the exploitation of noise correlation by CF\nand AF accrues more benefit when the source-relay link is weak. This paper also\nconsiders the optimal power allocation problem under the correlated-noise\nchannel setting. With individual power constraints at the relay and the source,\nit is shown that the relay should use all its available power to maximize the\nachievable rates under any correlation coefficient. With a total power\nconstraint across the source and the relay, the achievable rates are proved to\nbe concave functions over the power allocation factor for AF and CF under\nfull-duplex mode, where the closed-form power allocation strategy is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 01:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The one-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator in a box is used to introduce the concept of an\noblique-basis shell-model theory. By implementing the Lanczos method for\ndiagonalization of large matrices, and the Cholesky algorithm for solving\ngeneralized eigenvalue problems, the method is applied to nuclei. The\nmixed-symmetry basis combines traditional spherical shell-model states with\nSU(3) collective configurations. We test the validity of this mixed-symmetry\nscheme on 24Mg and 44Ti. Results for 24Mg, obtained using the Wilthental USD\nintersection in a space that spans less than 10% of the full-space, reproduce\nthe binding energy within 2% as well as an accurate reproduction of the\nlow-energy spectrum and the structure of the states - 90% overlap with the\nexact eigenstates. In contrast, for an m-scheme calculation, one needs about\n60% of the full space to obtain compatible results. Calculations for 44Ti\nsupport the mixed-mode scheme although the pure SU(3) calculations with few\nirreps are not as good as the standard m-scheme calculations. The strong\nbreaking of the SU(3) symmetry results in relatively small enhancements within\nthe combined basis. However, an oblique-basis calculation in 50% of the full\npf-shell space is as good as a usual m-scheme calculation in 80% of the space.\nResults for the lower pf-shell nuclei 44-48Ti and 48Cr, using the Kuo-Brown-3\ninteraction, show that SU(3) symmetry breaking in this region is driven by the\nsingle-particle spin-orbit splitting. In our study we observe some interesting\ncoherent structures, such as coherent mixing of basis states,\nquasi-perturbative behavior in the toy model, and enhanced B(E2) strengths\nclose to the SU(3) limit even though SU(3) appears to be rather badly broken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 04:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-18"}

The increase in M_sph is also calculated by\nusing a continuity equation and a star formation model, which uses\nobservational data for the formation rate and stellar mass function. We find\nthat the black hole to spheroid mass ratio is expected to be substantially\nunchanged since z~1.2 for high mass objects (M_BH>10^8.5M_SUN and\nM_sph>10^11.3M_SUN). In the same redshift range, the spheroid mass is found to\nincrease more rapidly than the black hole mass if M_sph>10^11M_SUN.

Our model includes the\nsuppression of gas accretion from gravitational shock heating and AGN jets\nmainly for M_halo > M_shock ~ 10^12 M_Sun and from a too hot IGM onto haloes\nwith v_circ < 40 km/s, as well as stellar feedback that drives gas out of\nhaloes mainly with v_circ < 120 km/s. We run our model on the merger trees of\nthe haloes and subhaloes of a high-resolution dark matter cosmological\nsimulation. The galaxy mass is taken as the maximum between the mass given by\nthe model and the sum of the masses of its progenitors (reduced by tidal\nstripping). Designed to reproduce the present-day stellar mass function of\ngalaxies, our model matches fairly well the evolution of the cosmic stellar\ndensity. It leads to the same z=0 relation between central galaxy stellar and\nhalo mass as the one found by abundance matching and also as that previously\nmeasured at high mass on SDSS centrals. Our model also predicts a bimodal\ndistribution (centrals and satellites) of stellar masses for given halo mass,\nin good agreement with SDSS observations. The relative importance of mergers\ndepends much more on stellar than halo mass. Galaxies with m_stars > 10^11\nM_Sun/h acquire most of their mass through mergers (mostly major and gas-poor),\nas expected from our model's shutdown of gas accretion at high M_halo. However,\nmergers are rare for m_stars < 10^11 M_Sun/h (greater than our mass\nresolution), a consequence of the curvature of the stellar vs. halo mass\nrelation. So gas accretion must be the dominant growth mechanism for\nintermediate and low mass galaxies, e.g. dwarf ellipticals in clusters, except\nthat gas-rich galaxy mergers account for the bulk of the growth of ellipticals\nwith m_stars ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun/h, which we predict must be the typical mass of\nULIRGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 14:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 16:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

Thereby, they rearrange the\nstructural particles until formation of a dense particle packing and introduce\nlocal heterogeneities in the structure. In this paper, microstructures with\nvolume fractions between 0.4 and 0.6 produced by VEM are analyzed with respect\nto their degree of heterogeneity (DOH). In particular, the influence of the\nvoid- to structural particle number ratio, which constitutes a principal\nVEM-parameter, on the DOH is studied. The DOH is quantified using the pore size\ndistribution, the Voronoi volume distribution and the density-fluctuation\nmethod in conjunction with fit functions or integral measures. This analysis\nhas revealed that for volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.55 the void-particle\nnumber allows for a quasi-continuous adjustment of the DOH. Additionally, the\nDOH-range of VEM-generated microstructures with a volume fraction of 0.4 is\ncompared to the range covered by microstructures generated using previous\nBrownian dynamics simulations, which represent the structure of coagulated\ncolloidal suspensions.

Starting from the BBGKY hierarchy, or using projection\noperator technics or a quasilinear theory, a general kinetic equation can be\nderived when collective effects are neglected. This equation (which is not\nwell-known) applies to possibly spatially inhomogeneous systems, which is\nspecific to systems with long-range interactions. Interestingly, the structure\nof this kinetic equation bears a clear physical meaning in terms of generalized\nKubo relations. Furthermore, this equation takes a very similar form for\nstellar systems and two-dimensional point vortices providing therefore a\nunified description of the kinetic theory of these systems. If we assume that\nthe system is spatially homogeneous (or axisymmetric for point vortices), this\nequation can be simplified and reduces to the Landau equation (or its\ncounterpart for point vortices). Our formalism thus offers a simple derivation\nof Landau-type equations. We also use this general formalism to derive a\nkinetic equation, written in angle-action variables, describing spatially\ninhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions. This new derivation solves\nthe shortcomings of our previous derivation [P.H. Chavanis, Physica A 377, 469\n(2007)]. Finally, we consider a test particle approach and derive general\nexpressions for the diffusion and friction (or drift) coefficients of a test\nparticle evolving in a bath of field particles. We make contact with the\nexpressions previously obtained in the literature. As an application of the\nkinetic theory, we argue that the relaxation time is shorter for inhomogeneous\n(or high-dimensional) systems than for homogeneous (or low-dimensional) systems\nbecause there are potentially more resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 13:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

With a view to\nanswering this long-standing question, we define a general class of\ndegree-degree correlated networks and obtain the associated Shannon entropy as\na function of parameters. It turns out that the maximum entropy does not\ntypically correspond to uncorrelated networks, but to either assortative\n(correlated) or disassortative (anticorrelated) ones. More specifically, for\nhighly heterogeneous (scale-free) networks, the maximum entropy principle\nusually leads to disassortativity, providing a parsimonious explanation to the\nquestion above. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations measured in some\nreal-world networks with those yielding maximum entropy for the same degree\nsequence, we find a remarkable agreement in various cases. Our approach\nprovides a neutral model from which, in the absence of further knowledge\nregarding network evolution, one can obtain the expected value of correlations.\nIn cases in which empirical observations deviate from the neutral predictions\n-- as happens in social networks -- one can then infer that there are specific\ncorrelating mechanisms at work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 15:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-16"}
