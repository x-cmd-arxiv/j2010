These signals are detected and processed by biochemical networks, which\nare often highly stochastic. To understand how cells cope with a fluctuating\nenvironment, we therefore have to understand how reliably biochemical networks\ncan transmit time-varying signals. To this end, we must understand both the\nnoise characteristics and the amplification properties of networks. In this\nmanuscript, we use information theory to study how reliably signalling cascades\nemploying autoregulation and feedback can transmit time-varying signals. We\ncalculate the frequency-dependence of the gain-to-noise ratio, which reflects\nhow reliably a network transmits signals at different frequencies. We find that\nthe gain-to-noise ratio may differ qualitatively from the power spectrum of the\noutput, showing that the latter does not directly reflect signaling\nperformance. Moreover, we find that auto-activation and auto-repression\nincrease and decrease the gain-to-noise ratio for all of frequencies,\nrespectively. Positive feedback specifically enhances information transmission\nat low frequencies, while negative feedback increases signal fidelity at high\nfrequencies. Our analysis not only elucidates the role of autoregulation and\nfeedback in naturally-occurring biological networks, but also reveals design\nprinciples that can be used for the reliable transmission of time-varying\nsignals in synthetic gene circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 16:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-01"}

We generically formulate a photospheric emission model of GRBs\nincluding Compton up-scattered photospheric (UP) emission off the electrons\n(and positrons) in the internal shocks, and find that the photospheric emission\nmay correspond to the traditional (Band) component at <~1 MeV and the UP\nemission to the high-energy emission observed by Fermi/LAT for some GRBs at >~\n10 MeV. The two components can be separate in the spectrum in some cases or can\nmimic a smooth broad Band spectrum in other cases. We apply our formulation to\nthe well-studied long and short LAT GRBs, GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, and GRB\n090510, and typically find reasonable parameters for fitting the time-binned\nspectra, although fine tuning of several parameters is required. The observed\ndelays of the high-energy emission with respect to the MeV emission which are\nlarge compared to the variability times are unlikely to be due to simple\nkinematic effects of a non-evolving jet. These delays may be attributed to the\ntemporal evolution of the physical parameters of the jet, and thus the delay\ntimescales could provide a potential tool for investigating the structures of\nGRB jets themselves and their progenitors. The difference of the delay\ntimescales of long and short GRBs inferred from the Fermi data might be due to\nthe differences in the progenitors of long and short GRBs.

We parametrize the\nsingle-band variability by a power-law model for the light-curve structure\nfunction, with amplitude A and power-law index gamma. We show that quasars can\nbe efficiently separated from other non-variable and variable sources by the\nlocation of the individual sources in the A-gamma plane. We use ~60 epochs of\nimaging data, taken over ~5 years, from the SDSS stripe 82 (S82) survey, where\nextensive spectroscopy provides a reference sample of quasars, to demonstrate\nthe power of variability as a quasar classifier in multi-epoch surveys. For\nUV-excess selected objects, variability performs just as well as the standard\nSDSS color selection, identifying quasars with a completeness of 90% and a\npurity of 95%. In the redshift range 2.5<z<3, where color selection is known to\nbe problematic, variability can select quasars with a completeness of 90% and a\npurity of 96%. This is a factor of 5-10 times more pure than existing\ncolor-selection of quasars in this redshift range. Selecting objects from a\nbroad griz color box without u-band information, variability selection in S82\ncan afford completeness and purity of 92%, despite a factor of 30 more\ncontaminants than quasars in the color-selected feeder sample. This confirms\nthat the fraction of quasars hidden in the 'stellar locus' of color-space is\nsmall. To test variability selection in the context of Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) we\ncreated mock PS1 data by down-sampling the S82 data to just 6 epochs over 3\nyears. Even with this much sparser time sampling, variability is an\nencouragingly efficient classifier. For instance, a 92% pure and 44% complete\nquasar candidate sample is attainable from the above $griz$-selected catalog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 22:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 09:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 07:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Specially, these include (i) identical packets must be delivered\nsuccessfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packet\nto be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate is\ndominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and\nretransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a\ntractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key\ntraits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process\n(PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters\nand receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the\nmaximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum\nintensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage\nconstraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is\nmulticasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into $v$ smaller\nregions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of\nseveral key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main\nresult. Assuming $\\tau/v$ transmission attempts are allowed for each\ntessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the MTC is $\\Theta(\\rho\nk^{x}\\log(k)v^{y})$ where $\\rho$, $x$ and $y$ are functions of $\\tau$ and $v$\ndepending on the network size and intensity, and $k$ is the average number of\nthe intended receivers in a cluster. We derive $\\{\\rho, x, y\\}$ for a number of\nregimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number of\nretransmissions can significantly enhance the MTC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 22:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 19:44:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2010 04:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 15:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

With increasing redshift, the ratio Gamma=MBH/Mbulge relative to z=0\nalso seems to be larger for MBH >~ 10^{8.5} Msol. This study looks more closely\nat statistics to better understand the creation and observations of the\nMBH-Mbulge correlation. It is possible to show that if galaxy merging\nstatistics can drive the correlation, minor mergers are responsible for causing\na *convergence to linearity* most evident at high masses, whereas major mergers\nhave a central limit convergence that more strongly *reduces the scatter*. This\nstatistical reasoning is agnostic about galaxy morphology. Therefore, combining\nstatistical prediction (more major mergers ==> tighter correlation) with\nobservations (bulges = tightest correlation), would lead one to conclude that\nmore major mergers (throughout an entire merger tree, not just the primary\nbranch) give rise to more prominent bulges. With regard to controversial\nfindings that Gamma increases with redshift, this study shows why the\nluminosity function (LF) bias argument, taken correctly at face value,\nstrengthens rather than weakens the results. However, correcting for LF bias is\nunwarranted because the BH mass scale for quasars is bootstrapped to the\nMBH-Sigma* correlation in normal galaxies at z=0, and quasar-quasar comparisons\nare internally consistent. In Monte-Carlo simulations, high Gamma objects are\n\"under-merged\" galaxies that take longer to converge to linearity via minor\nmergers. Another evidence that the galaxies are undermassive at z >~ 2 for\ntheir MBH is that the quasar hosts are very compact for their expected mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2010 00:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

What I have done\nin this paper is to generalize these relations to relations among generating\nseries of iterated integrals. Since the main result is formulated in terms of\ngenerating series, it gives infinitely many relations - one for each\ncoefficient of the generating series. The lower order terms give the well known\nclassical relations. The new result is reciprocity for the higher degree terms,\nwhich give non-trivial relations among iterated integrals on a Riemann surface.\nAs an application we refine the definition of Manin's noncommutative modular\nsymbol in order to include Eisenstein series.
