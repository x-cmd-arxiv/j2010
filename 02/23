GN20 is one of\nthe most luminous starburst galaxy known at z > 4, and is a member of a rich\nproto-cluster of galaxies at z = 4.05 in GOODS-North. We have observed the CO\n1-0 and 2-1 emission with the VLA, the CO 6-5 emission with the PdBI\nInterferometer, and the 5-4 emission with CARMA. The H_2 mass derived from the\nCO 1-0 emission is 1.3 \\times 10^{11} (\\alpha/0.8) Mo. High resolution imaging\nof CO 2-1 shows emission distributed over a large area, appearing as partial\nring, or disk, of ~ 10kpc diameter. The integrated CO excitation is higher than\nfound in the inner disk of the Milky Way, but lower than that seen in high\nredshift quasar host galaxies and low redshift starburst nuclei. The VLA CO 2-1\nimage at 0.2\" resolution shows resolved, clumpy structure, with a few brighter\nclumps with intrinsic sizes ~ 2 kpc. The velocity field determined from the CO\n6-5 emission is consistent with a rotating disk with a rotation velocity of ~\n570 km s^{-1} (using an inclination angle of 45^o), from which we derive a\ndynamical mass of 3 \\times 10^{11} \\msun within about 4 kpc radius. The star\nformation distribution, as derived from imaging of the radio synchrotron and\ndust continuum, is on a similar scale as the molecular gas distribution. The\nmolecular gas and star formation are offset by ~ 1\" from the HST I-band\nemission, implying that the regions of most intense star formation are highly\ndust-obscured on a scale of ~ 10 kpc. The large spatial extent and ordered\nrotation of this object suggests that this is not a major merger, but rather a\nclumpy disk accreting gas rapidly in minor mergers or smoothly from the\nproto-intracluster medium.

The intrinsic brightness of Vela at GeV energies\ncombined with the angular resolution and sensitivity of the LAT allow us to\nmake the most detailed study to date of the energy-dependent light curves and\nphase-resolved spectra, using a LAT-derived timing model. The light curve\nconsists of two peaks (P1 and P2) connected by bridge emission containing a\nthird peak (P3). We have confirmed the strong decrease of the P1/P2 ratio with\nincreasing energy seen with EGRET and previous Fermi LAT data, and observe that\nP1 disappears above 20 GeV. The increase with energy of the mean phase of the\nP3 component can be followed with much greater detail, showing that P3 and P2\nare present up to the highest energies of pulsation. We find significant pulsed\nemission at phases outside the main profile, indicating that magnetospheric\nemission exists over 80% of the pulsar period. With increased high-energy\ncounts the phase-averaged spectrum is seen to depart from a power- law with\nsimple exponential cutoff, and is better fit with a more gradual cutoff. The\nspectra in fixed-count phase bins are well fit with power-laws with exponential\ncutoffs, revealing a strong and complex phase dependence of the cutoff energy,\nespecially in the peaks.

We detected 259 candidate\nvariables in this field, of which only 13 (all of them bright Cepheids) were\npreviously known. Out of the confirmed variables, we found 90 RR Lyrae stars,\n49 classical Cepheids (including 36 new discoveries), and 38 eclipsing binary\nstars for which we could determine a period. The RR Lyrae include 61\nfundamental (RRab) and 24 first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, and 5 pulsating in\nboth modes simultaneously (RRd). As for the majority of LG dwarfs, the mean\nperiods of the RRab and RRc (0.611 and 0.334 day, respectively) as well as the\nfraction of overtone pulsators (f_c=0.28) place this galaxy in the intermediate\nregime between the Oosterhoff types. From their position on the\nperiod-luminosity diagram and light-curve morphology, we can unambiguously\nclassify 25 and 14 Cepheids as fundamental and first-overtone mode pulsators,\nrespectively. Another two are clearly second-overtone Cepheids, the first ones\nto be discovered beyond the Magellanic Clouds.

Although the baryons provide a substantial glue to the subhalos, the\nmain halos exhibit the same trend. This assures a more efficient tidal\ndisruption of the BDM subhalos.

An experiment different from which-path\ntest is proposed, which shows that detectors are responsible for strongly\ndecohering the wave-function, but not for making parts of it disappear.\nMoreover, one of the branches supposed to disappear may produce an interference\npattern with a wave-packet of another particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 23:12:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 01:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2010 21:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 07:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 12:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Typically, the\nchannel responses are estimated one-at-a-time: a single source sends out a\nknown probe signal, the receiver measures the probe signal convolved with the\nchannel response, and the responses are recovered using deconvolution. In this\npaper, we show that if the channel responses are sparse and the probe signals\nare random, then we can significantly reduce the total amount of time required\nto probe the channels by activating all of the sources simultaneously. With all\nsources activated simultaneously, the receiver measures a superposition of all\nthe channel responses convolved with the respective probe signals. Separating\nthis cumulative response into individual channel responses can be posed as a\nlinear inverse problem.\n  We show that channel response separation is possible (and stable) even when\nthe probing signals are relatively short in spite of the corresponding linear\nsystem of equations becoming severely underdetermined. We derive a theoretical\nlower bound on the length of the source signals that guarantees that this\nseparation is possible with high probability. The bound is derived by putting\nthe problem in the context of finding a sparse solution to an underdetermined\nsystem of equations, and then using mathematical tools from the theory of\ncompressive sensing. Finally, we discuss some practical applications of these\nresults, which include forward modeling for seismic imaging, channel\nequalization in multiple-input multiple-output communication, and increasing\nthe field-of-view in an imaging system by using coded apertures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 23:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In the classical supergravity\nlimit the answer for a large class of theories has been known for some time.\nHowever, in the full quantum theory the U-duality group is broken to a discrete\nsubgroup and the question of U-duality orbits in this case is a nuanced matter.\nIn the present work we address this issue in the context of N=8 supergravity in\nfour, five and six dimensions. The purpose of this note is to present and\nclarify what is currently known about these discrete orbits while at the same\ntime filling in some of the details not yet appearing in the literature. To\nthis end we exploit the mathematical framework of integral Jordan algebras and\nFreudenthal triple systems. The charge vector of the dyonic black string in D=6\nis SO(5,5;Z) related to a two-charge reduced canonical form uniquely specified\nby a set of two arithmetic U-duality invariants. Similarly, the black hole\n(string) charge vectors in D=5 are E_{6(6)}(Z) equivalent to a three-charge\ncanonical form, again uniquely fixed by a set of three arithmetic U-duality\ninvariants. The situation in four dimensions is less clear: while black holes\npreserving more than 1/8 of the supersymmetries may be fully classified by\nknown arithmetic E_{7(7)}(Z) invariants, 1/8-BPS and non-BPS black holes yield\nincreasingly subtle orbit structures, which remain to be properly understood.\nHowever, for the very special subclass of projective black holes a complete\nclassification is known. All projective black holes are E_{7(7)}(Z) related to\na four or five charge canonical form determined uniquely by the set of known\narithmetic U-duality invariants. Moreover, E_{7(7)}(Z) acts transitively on the\ncharge vectors of black holes with a given leading-order entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 23:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 12:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Methods. We carried out L (3.78 microns) photometry on\nimages of six young embedded star clusters associated with cloud D of the Vela\nMolecular Ridge, taken with ISAAC at the VLT. These data are complemented with\nthe available HKs photometry. The 6 clusters are roughly of the same size and\nappear to be in the same evolutionary stage. The fraction of stars with a\ncircumstellar disk was measured in each cluster by counting the fraction of\nsources displaying a NIR excess in colour-colour (HKsL) diagrams. Results. The\nL photometry allowed us to identify the NIR counterparts of the IRAS sources\nassociated with the clusters.

The fraction of stars with a\ncircumstellar disk in the observed sample is consistent with the relations\nderived from larger samples of star clusters and with other age estimates for\ncloud D.

If we supply a scalar field\npulse, it will asymptotically form a black hole via dynamical interactions of\nthe Brans-Dicke field. Hence, we can observe the responses of the Brans-Dicke\nfield by two different regions. First, we observe the late time behaviors after\nthe gravitational collapse, which include formations of a singularity and an\napparent horizon. Second, we observe the fully dynamical behaviors during the\ngravitational collapse and view the energy-momentum tensor components. For the\nlate time behaviors, if the Brans-Dicke coupling is greater (or smaller) than\n-1.5, the Brans-Dicke field decreases (or increases) during the gravitational\ncollapse. Since the Brans-Dicke field should be relaxed to the asymptotic value\nwith the elapse of time, the final apparent horizon becomes time-like (or\nspace-like).

Furthermore, we find that while one reaction\nmay more reliably transmit information than another when considered in\nisolation, when placed within a signalling cascade the relative performance of\nthe two reactions can be reversed.

An association rule is a form of partial implication\nbetween two sets of binary variables. In the most common approach, association\nrules are parameterized by a lower bound on their confidence, which is the\nempirical conditional probability of their consequent given the antecedent,\nand/or by some other parameter bounds such as \"support\" or deviation from\nindependence. We study here notions of redundancy among association rules from\na fundamental perspective. We see each transaction in a dataset as an\ninterpretation (or model) in the propositional logic sense, and consider\nexisting notions of redundancy, that is, of logical entailment, among\nassociation rules, of the form \"any dataset in which this first rule holds must\nobey also that second rule, therefore the second is redundant\". We discuss\nseveral existing alternative definitions of redundancy between association\nrules and provide new characterizations and relationships among them. We show\nthat the main alternatives we discuss correspond actually to just two variants,\nwhich differ in the treatment of full-confidence implications. For each of\nthese two notions of redundancy, we provide a sound and complete deduction\ncalculus, and we show how to construct complete bases (that is,\naxiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size in terms of the number of rules. We\nexplore finally an approach to redundancy with respect to several association\nrules, and fully characterize its simplest case of two partial premises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 10:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2010 22:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

These (real) gates/lattices are useful for quantum error correction:\nfor instance, the two and four-qubit real Clifford groups are the automorphism\ngroups of the lattices $D_4$ and $BW_{16}$, respectively, and the three-qubit\nreal Clifford group is maximal in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. Technically, the\nautomorphism group $Aut(\\Lambda)$ of the lattice $\\Lambda$ is the set of\northogonal matrices $B$ such that, following the conjugation action by the\ngenerating matrix of the lattice, the output matrix is unimodular (of\ndeterminant $\\pm 1$, with integer entries). When the degree $n$ is equal to the\nnumber of basis elements of $\\Lambda$, then $Aut(\\Lambda)$ also acts on basis\nvectors and is generated with matrices $B$ such that the sum of squared entries\nin a row is one, i.e. $B$ may be seen as a quantum gate. For the dense lattices\nlisted above, maximal multipartite entanglement arises. In particular, one\nfinds a balanced tripartite entanglement in $E_8$ (the two- and three- tangles\nhave equal magnitude 1/4) and a GHZ type entanglement in BW$_{16}$. In this\npaper, we also investigate the entangled gates from $D_{12}^+$ and\n$\\Lambda_{24}$, by seeing them as systems coupling a qutrit to two- and\nthree-qubits, respectively.

This is well\napproximated by a single episode that peaked roughly 12+/-0.5 Gyr ago and\nlasted no longer than about 1.9+/-0.5 Gyr (FWHM). Our solution also suggests\nthat essentially no stars formed in Cetus during the past 8 Gyrs. This makes\nCetus' SFH comparable to that of the oldest Milky Way dSphs. Given the current\nisolation of Cetus in the outer fringes of the Local Group, this implies that\nCetus is a clear outlier in the morphology-Galactocentric distance relation\nthat holds for the majority of Milky Way dwarf satellites.

The liftings are designed to eliminate dominant\ntrapping sets of the base code by removing the short cycles which form the\ntrapping sets. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the cyclic\npermutations assigned to the edges of a cycle $c$ of length $\\ell(c)$ in the\nbase graph such that the inverse image of $c$ in the lifted graph consists of\nonly cycles of length strictly larger than $\\ell(c)$.

The proposed method is applied to\nboth structured and random codes over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The\nerror floor improves consistently by increasing the lifting degree, and the\nresults show significant improvements in the error floor compared to the base\ncode, a random code of the same degree distribution and block length, and a\nrandom lifting of the same degree.

Natural criterion functions are often unavailable for general\nfunctional measurement error models due to the lack of information on the\ndistribution of the unobservable covariates. Typically, the parameter\nestimation is via solving estimating equations. In addition, the construction\nof such estimating equations routinely requires solving integral equations,\nhence the computation is often much more intensive compared with ordinary\nregression models. Because of these difficulties, traditional best subset\nvariable selection procedures are not applicable, and in the measurement error\nmodel context, variable selection remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we\ndevelop a framework for variable selection in measurement error models via\npenalized estimating equations. We first propose a class of selection\nprocedures for general parametric measurement error models and for general\nsemi-parametric measurement error models, and study the asymptotic properties\nof the proposed procedures. Then, under certain regularity conditions and with\na properly chosen regularization parameter, we demonstrate that the proposed\nprocedure performs as well as an oracle procedure. We assess the finite sample\nperformance via Monte Carlo simulation studies and illustrate the proposed\nmethodology through the empirical analysis of a familiar data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 13:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-24"}

We find that\nthe light curves of HR 7355 in various filters are quite similar, with\namplitudes 0.035(4), 0.036(4), and 0.038(3) mag in B, Hp and V, respectively.\nThe light curves are double-peaked, with unevenly deep minima. We substantially\nrefine the rotational period to be P=0.5214410(4) d, indicating that HR 7355 is\nthe most rapidly rotating CP star known. Our period analyses reveal a possible\nlengthening of the rotational period with dP/dt/P = 2.4(8)x 10^-6/yr. We\nconclude that the shape and amplitude of HR 7355 light curves are typical of\nmagnetic He-strong CP stars, for which light variations are the result of\nphotospheric spots on the surface of a rotating star. We hypothesise that the\nlight variations are caused mainly by an uneven distribution of overabundant\nhelium on the star's surface. We briefly describe and discuss the cause of the\nrapid rotational braking of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2010 14:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
