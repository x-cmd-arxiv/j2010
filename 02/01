It comprises of two steps : (1)\nIdentification and Extraction of the data regions based on visual clues\ninformation. (2) Identification and extraction of flat and nested data records\nfrom the data region of a web page automatically. For step1, a novel and more\neffective method is proposed, which finds the data regions formed by all types\nof tags using visual clues. For step2, a more effective and efficient method\nnamely, Visual Clue based Extraction of web Data (VCED), is proposed, which\nextracts each record from the data region and identifies it whether it is a\nflat or nested data record based on visual clue information the area covered by\nand the number of data items present in each record.

Therefore this\ndevice is well suitable for medical imaging or applications such as small angle\nx-ray scattering, where the requirements on the dynamic of the detector are\nexceptional high. Basically the described detector is an ionization chamber\nadapted to fan beam geometry with an active area of 192 cm and a pitch of the\nanode strips of 150 micrometer.

Our approach is based only upon 2D radiative fields at the surface\nand at the top of atmosphere of a general planetary body. Using 2D fields at\nthe top of atmosphere alone, we derive lower bounds to the rate of material\nentropy production and to the intensity of the Lorenz energy cycle. By\nintroducing a measure of the efficiency of the planetary system with respect to\nhorizontal thermodynamical processes, we provide insight on a previous\nintuition on the possibility of defining a baroclinic heat engine extracting\nwork from the meridional heat flux. The approximate formula of the material\nentropy production is verified and used for studying the global thermodynamic\nproperties of climate models (CMs) included in the PCMDI/CMIP3 dataset in\npre-industrial climate conditions. It is found that about 90% of the material\nentropy production is due to vertical processes such as convection, whereas the\nlarge scale meridional heat transport contributes only about 10%. The total\nmaterial entropy production is typically 55 mWK-1m-2, with discrepancies of the\norder of 5% and CMs' baroclinic efficiencies are clustered around 0.055.

Although dipolar relaxation generally increases as a function of\na static magnetic field intensity, we find a range of non-zero magnetic field\nintensities where dipolar relaxation is strongly reduced. We use this resonant\nreduction to accurately determine the S=6 scattering length of chromium atoms:\n$a_6 = 103 \\pm 4 a_0$.

Since the QND\ncoupling arises naturally in interactions between light and a macroscopic\nensemble of atoms, or between light and a micro-mechanical oscillator, the\nproposed interface is capable of transferring a state of light onto these\nmatter systems. The transfer itself is perfect and deterministic for any\nquantum state, for arbitrarily small interaction strengths, and for arbitrarily\nlarge noise of the target system. It requires an all-optical pre-processing,\nrequiring a coupling stronger than that between the light and the matter, and a\ndisplacement feed-forward correction of the matter system. We also suggest a\nprobabilistic version of the interface, which eliminates the need for the\nfeed-forward correction at a cost of reduced success rate.

We proposed\nto realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made\nof several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were\nthe thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height).\nThis paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour\nerror. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the\nneeded material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on\nthe appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups\nduring forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations\ncan cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during\nmanufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming\noperations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two\nforming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is\nto reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed\nmaterial (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in\ndefining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and\nthen simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine\ntransformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming\noperation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links\nbetween the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then\npossible by using mathematical links. This original approach leads the ears'\namplitude to be reduced by a factor of 10, with only 15 numerical experiments.\nMoreover, we have limited the number of forming stages from 4 to 2 with a\nminimal material use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 14:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-02"}

Using cosmologically motivated models,\nwe estimate that the mass of Sgr's dark matter halo prior to tidal disruption\nwas ~10^10 solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 15:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The temperature dependence of the ultrasound attenuation in the A-like\nphase was determined for the entire superfluid region exploiting the field\ninduced meta-stable A-like phase at the highest field. In the lower field, the\nA-B transition in aerogel was identified by a smooth jump in attenuation on\nboth cooling and warming. Based on the transitions observed on warming, a phase\ndiagram as a function of pressure (P), temperature (T) and magnetic field (B)\nis constructed. We find that the A-B phase boundary in aerogel recedes in a\ndrastically different manner than in bulk in response to an increasing magnetic\nfield. The implications of the observed phase diagram are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 15:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 20:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The characteristic is considered for itself and\nnot according to its incidence in the assembly. Inertial tolerancing proposes\nanother alternative of tolerancing in order to guarantee the final assembly\ncharacteristic. The inertia I2 = \\sqrt{\\delta^2 + \\sigma^2} is not toleranced\nby a tolerance interval but by a scalar representing the maximum inertia that\nthe characteristic should not exceed. We detail how to calculate the inertial\ntolerances according to two cases, one aims to guarantee an inertia of the\nassembly characteristic the other a tolerance interval on the assembly\ncharacteristic by a Cpk capability index, in the particular but common case of\nuniform tolerances or more general with non uniform tolerances. An example will\nbe detailed to show the results of the different tolerancing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 15:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-02"}

Particles are inserted at\nthe leftmost site at rate $\\alpha$, hop to the right at unit rate, and are\nremoved at the rightmost site at rate $\\beta$. Our study is motivated by recent\nexperiments on colloidal particles in optical tweezer arrays. The external\npotential is of the form generated by such an array. Particles spend most of\nthe time near potential minima, approximating the situation in the lattice gas;\na short-range repulsive interaction prevents two particles from occupying the\nsame potential well. A constant driving force, representing Stokes drag on\nparticles suspended in a moving fluid, leads to biased motion. Our results for\nthe density profile and current, obtained via numerical integration of the\nLangevin equation and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the\ncontinuous-space model exhibits phase transitions analogous to those observed\nin the lattice model. The correspondence is not exact, however, due to the lack\nof particle-hole symmetry in our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 15:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-02"}

In this paper the DCA is applied to the\ndetection of outgoing port scans using TCP SYN packets.
