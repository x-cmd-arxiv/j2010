We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle\npossible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then\nwe find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible\nonly if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal\ndissipation is very effective. On the other hand we found that a system like HD\n40307 with minimum masses and more realistic tidal dissipation could be\nproduced if the eccentricity of the outermost planet was impulsively increased\nto about 0.15. The form of resonantly coupled tidal evolution we consider here\nis quite general and could be of greater significance for systems with inner\nplanets on significantly shorter orbital periods characteristic of for example\nCoRoT 7 b.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 16:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

As a standard method, the two-point\ncorrelation functions $xi_\\pm(theta)$ of the cosmic shear field are used as\nstatistical measures for the shear field. In order to separate the observed\nshear into E- and B-modes, the latter being most likely produced by remaining\nsystematics in the data set and/or intrinsic alignment effects, several\nstatistics have been defined before. Here we aim at a complete E-/B-mode\ndecomposition of the cosmic shear information contained in the $xi_\\pm$ on a\nfinite angular interval. We construct two sets of such E-/B-mode measures,\nnamely Complete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-mode Integrals (COSEBIs), characterized\nby weight functions between the $xi_\\pm$ and the COSEBIs which are polynomials\nin $theta$ or polynomials in $ln(theta)$, respectively. Considering the\nlikelihood in cosmological parameter space, constructed from the COSEBIs, we\nstudy their information contents. We show that the information grows with the\nnumber of COSEBI modes taken into account, and that an asymptotic limit is\nreached which defines the maximum available information in the E-mode component\nof the $xi_\\pm$. We show that this limit is reached the earlier (i.e., for a\nsmaller number of modes considered) the narrower the angular range is over\nwhich $xi_\\pm$ are measured, and it is reached much earlier for logarithmic\nweight functions. For example, for $xi_\\pm$ on the interval $1'\\le \\theta\\le\n400'$, the asymptotic limit for the parameter pair $(Omega_m, sigma_8)$ is\nreached for $\\sim 25$ modes in the linear case, but already for 5 modes in the\nlogarithmic case.

These observations\nrevealed three important features, i.e.: (1) the jets are generated in the\nlower chromosphere, (2) the length and lifetime of the jets are 0.4-5 Mm and\n40-320 sec, (3) the apparent velocity of the jets with Hinode SOT are 3-24\nkm/s, while Ca II K3 component at the jets show blueshifts (in 5 events) in the\nrange of 2- 6 km/s. The chromospheric anemone jets are associated with mixed\npolarity regions which are either small emerging flux regions or moving\nmagnetic features. It is found that the Ca II K line often show red or blue\nasymmetry in K2/K1 component: the footpoint of the jets associated with\nemerging flux regions often show redshift (2-16 km/s), while the one with\nmoving magnetic features show blueshift (around 5 km/s). Detailed analysis of\nmagnetic evolution of the jet foaming regions revealed that the reconnection\nrate (or canceling rate) of the total magnetic flux at the footpoint of the\njets are of order of 10^{16} Mx/s, and the resulting magnetic energy release\nrate (1.1-10) x 10^{24} erg/s, with the total energy release (1-13) x 10^{26}\nerg for the duration of the magnetic cancellations, 130s. These are comparable\nto the estimated total energy, 10^{26} erg, in a single chromospheric anemone\njet. An observation-based physical model of the jet is presented. The relation\nbetween chromospheric anemone jets and Ellerman bombs is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 17:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Some classical\npolynomial-time optimization problems, such as spanning tree and forest,\nshortest path, (perfect) matching, independent set (basis) in a matroid or in\nthe intersection of two matroids, become NP-hard even with one budget\nconstraint. Still, for most of these problems deterministic and randomized\npolynomial-time approximation schemes are known.

Apart from this initial condition, the deflagration\nstage is treated in a parameter-free approach. The detonation is initiated when\nthe turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. This occurs at\ndensities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ -- relatively low as compared to existing\nnucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. The\nburning in these multidimensional models is different from that in\none-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both into\nunburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarf\nand into the low density region near the surface. Thus, the resulting yield is\na mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning products\nat low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities,\nas well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. In\ncontrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce a\ncharacteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraints\nfrom Galactic chemical evolution.

A similar example of another large EQ (Kythira, Greece, Ms =\n6.9R, 8th January, 2006) by using the very same methodology deviated for 43\nminutes only. The rest of the prognostic parameters: the epicenter location and\nthe magnitude of the Skyros EQ were utilized by manipulating the past seismic\nenergy release history of the regional seismogenic area and the observed\nearth's electric field which was recorded during the last 25 days, before the\noccurrence of the large seismic event, by VOL earth's electric field monitoring\nsite.

In this\nscenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the\nunderlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a\nlower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for\ndynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for\ndetonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses,\nwe investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of\ntriggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We\ncarried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two\ndimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using\nthe level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has\nbeen calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to\ndetermine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based\non approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that\nsecondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models,\nranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M_solar with corresponding shell\nmasses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M_solar.

But,\nthis phase can be easily missed by software developers because of their limited\ntime to complete the project. Since, software developers finish their software\nnearer to the delivery time; they dont get enough time to test their program by\ncreating effective test cases. . One of the major difficulties in software\ntesting is the generation of test cases that satisfy the given adequacy\ncriterion Moreover, creating manual test cases is a tedious work for software\ndevelopers in the final rush hours. A new approach which generates test cases\ncan help the software developers to create test cases from software\nspecifications in early stage of software development (before coding) and as\nwell as from program execution traces from after software development (after\ncoding). Heuristic techniques can be applied for creating quality test cases.\nMutation testing is a technique for testing software units that has great\npotential for improving the quality of testing, and to assure the high\nreliability of software. In this paper, a mutation testing based test cases\ngeneration technique has been proposed to generate test cases from program\nexecution trace, so that the test cases can be generated after coding. The\npaper details about the mutation testing implementation to generate test cases.\nThe proposed algorithm has been demonstrated for an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 20:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-11"}

IC443 is a shell-type supernova remnant with mixed\nmorphology located off the outer Galactic plane where high-energy emission has\nbeen detected in the X-ray, GeV and TeV gamma-ray bands. Past observations\nsuggest IC443 has been interacting with surrounding interstellar matter.\nProximity between dense shocked molecular clouds and GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission\nregions detected by EGRET, MAGIC and VERITAS suggests an interpretation that\ncosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated by the SNR. With the high gamma-ray\nstatistics and broad energy coverage provided by the LAT, we accurately\ncharacterize the gamma-ray emission produced by the CRs accelerated at IC443.\nThe emission region is extended in the energy band with theta_68 = 0.27 deg +/-\n0.01 deg (stat) +/- 0.03 deg (sys) for an assumed 2-dimensional Gaussian\nprofile and overlaps almost completely with the extended source region of\nVERITAS. Its centroid is displaced significantly from the known pulsar wind\nnebula (PWN) which suggests the PWN is not the major contributor in the present\nenergy band. The observed spectrum changes its power-law slope continuously and\ncontinues smoothly to the MAGIC and VERITAS data points. The combined gamma-ray\nspectrum (200MeV <E< 2TeV) is reproduced well by decays of neutral pions\nproduced by a broken power-law proton spectrum with a break around 70GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 20:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The data were\ntaken with the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network. The maser\npolarization is used to determine the full three-dimensional magnetic field\nstructure around Cepheus A HW2. The observations suggest that the masers probe\nthe large scale magnetic field and not isolated pockets of a compressed field.\nWe find that the magnetic field is predominantly aligned along the protostellar\noutflow and perpendicular to the molecular and dust disc. From the\nthree-dimensional magnetic field orientation and measurements of the magnetic\nfield strength along the line of sight, we are able to determine that the high\ndensity material, in which the masers occurs, is threaded by a large scale\nmagnetic field of ~23 mG. This indicates that the protostellar environment at\n~1000 AU from Cepheus A HW2 is slightly supercritical (lambda approximately\n1.7) and the relation between density and magnetic field is consistent with\ncollapse along the magnetic field lines. Thus, the observations indicate that\nthe magnetic field likely regulates accretion onto the disc. The magnetic field\ndominates the turbulent energies by approximately a factor of three and is\nsufficiently strong to be the crucial component stabilizing the massive\naccretion disc and sustaining the high accretion rates needed during massive\nstar-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

During post-main-sequence evolution, radial\nexpansion of the primary star, accompanied by intense winds, can significantly\nalter the binary orbit via tidal dissipation and mass loss. To investigate\nthis, we couple stellar evolution models (from the zero-age main-sequence\nthrough the end of the post-main sequence) to a tidal evolution code. The\nbinary's fate is determined by the initial masses of the primary and the\ncompanion, the initial orbit (taken to be circular), and the Reimers mass-loss\nparameter. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether the orbit\nexpands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a common\nenvelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation based on\nthe energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict period\ngaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. The upper end of\nthe gap is the shortest period at which a CE phase is avoided. The lower end is\nthe longest period at which companions survive their CE phase. For binary\nsystems with 1 $M_\\odot$ progenitors, we predict no Jupiter-mass companions\nwith periods $\\lesssim$270 days. Once engulfed, Jupiter-mass companions do not\nsurvive a CE phase.

Namely, the items can be grouped together in pools, and a single\nmeasurement would reveal whether there are one or more defectives in the pool.\nThe threshold model is a generalization of this idea where a measurement\nreturns positive if the number of defectives in the pool reaches a fixed\nthreshold $u > 0$, negative if this number is no more than a fixed lower\nthreshold $\\ell < u$, and may behave arbitrarily otherwise.

There is increasing evidence that\norganisms may indeed be employing near optimal Bayesian calculations in their\ndecision-making. An intriguing question relates to the properties of optimal\nencoding methods, namely determining the properties of neural populations in\nsensory layers that optimize performance, subject to physiological constraints.\nWithin an ecological theory of neural encoding/decoding, we show that optimal\nBayesian performance requires neural adaptation which reflects environmental\nchanges. Specifically, we predict that neuronal tuning functions possess an\noptimal width, which increases with prior uncertainty and environmental noise,\nand decreases with the decoding time window. Furthermore, even for static\nstimuli, we demonstrate that dynamic sensory tuning functions, acting at\nrelatively short time scales, lead to improved performance. Interestingly, the\nnarrowing of tuning functions as a function of time was recently observed in\nseveral biological systems. Such results set the stage for a functional theory\nwhich may explain the high reliability of sensory systems, and the utility of\nneuronal adaptation occurring at multiple time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 15:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-12"}

There are three ways to alleviate the problem: debris mitigation,\ndebris removal and collision avoidance. This paper addresses collision\navoidance, by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite\nincrease in orbit prediction accuracy. Batch least-squares differential\ncorrection is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog\nof space objects. Using a high-precision numerical propagator, we fit an orbit\nto state vectors derived from successive TLEs. We then propagate the fitted\norbit further forward in time. These predictions are compared to precision\nephemeris data derived from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) for\nseveral satellites, including objects in the congested sun-synchronous orbital\nregion. The method leads to a predicted range error that increases at a typical\nrate of 100 meters per day, approximately a 10-fold improvement over TLE's\npropagated with their associated analytic propagator (SGP4). Corresponding\nimprovements for debris trajectories could potentially provide initial\nconjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable\ncollision avoidance system.\n  We discuss additional optimization and the computational requirements for\napplying all-on-all conjunction analysis to the whole TLE catalog, present and\nnear future.

The DRAO 26-m Telescope has been equipped with a wideband feed, a\npolarization transducer to deliver both hands of circular polarization, and a\nreceiver, all operating from 1277 to 1762 MHz.

We calculate expected event\nrates of neutrino detection at SK and SNO for various theta_{13} values and\nboth normal and inverted hierarchies. The predicted event rates of bar{nu}_e\nand nu_e depend on the mixing angle theta_{13} for the inverted and normal\nhierarchies, respectively, and the influence of the shock appears for about 2 -\n8 s when sin^2 2 theta_{13} is larger than 10^{-3}.

The obtained ratio of the total event for high-energy neutrinos (20 MeV\n< E_{nu} < 60 MeV) to low-energy neutrinos (5 MeV < E_{nu} < 20 MeV) is\nconsistent with the previous studies in schematic semi-analytic or other\nhydrodynamic models of the shock propagation. The time dependence of the\ncalculated ratio of the event rates of high-energy to low-energy neutrinos is a\nvery useful observable which is sensitive to theta_{13} and hierarchies.\nNamely, time-dependent ratio shows clearer signal of the shock propagation that\nexhibits remarkable decrease by at most factor \\sim 2 for bar{nu}_e in inverted\n(SK), whereas it exhibits smaller change by \\sim 10 % for nu_e in normal\nhierarchy (SNO).

In addition, the\nequatorial flow is projected on the core-mantle boundary. It interacts with the\nmagnetic field at the core surface, through the radial component of the\nmagnetic induction equation.

The mini-halo is clearly\ndetected at 153 and 240 MHz while it is not detected at 610 MHz.

Moreover, we measure a systematic increase of\nthe high-frequency spectral index with radius: the azimuthal radial average of\nalpha_1477^240 increases from about 1.3, at the cluster center, up to about 2.0\nin the mini-halo outskirts.

In one set of simulations solenoidal forcing is applied,\nwhile the second set uses purely compressive forcing to excite turbulent\nmotions. From the resulting density field, we compute the mass distribution of\ngravitationally unstable cores by means of a clump-finding algorithm. Using the\ntime-averaged probability density functions of the mass density, semi-analytic\nmass distributions are calculated from analytical theories. We apply stability\ncriteria that are based on the Bonnor-Ebert mass resulting from the thermal\npressure and from the sum of thermal and turbulent pressure. Although there are\nuncertainties in the application of the clump-finding algorithm, we find\nsystematic differences in the mass distributions obtained from solenoidal and\ncompressive forcing. Compressive forcing produces a shallower slope in the\nhigh-mass power-law regime compared to solenoidal forcing. The mass\ndistributions also depend on the Jeans length resulting from the choice of the\nmass in the computational box, which is freely scalable for non-selfgravitating\nisothermal turbulence. Provided that all cores are numerically resolved and\nmost cores are small compared to the length scale of the forcing, the\nnormalised core mass distributions are found to be close to the semi-analytic\nmodels.

If the VHE emission is produced within ~10^{15} cm\n~1000 r_G (r_G=G M/c^2 is the Schwarzschild radius) of the SMBH, a decrease of\nthe VHE photon flux in the energy range 100--300 GeV is expected whenever an\nearly type or giant star approaches the line of sight within ~ milli-arcseconds\n(mas).

Based upon the currently known orbits of stars\nin the inner arcsecond of the Galaxy we find that PPEs lead to a systematic\ndimming in the 100--300 GeV band at the level of a few per cent and lasts for\nseveral weeks.
