We quantify the importance of\nuncalibrated photometric redshift outliers to the dark energy goals of\nforthcoming imaging surveys in a manner that does not assume any particular\nphotometric redshift technique or template. In so doing, we provide an\napproximate blueprint for computing the influence of specific outlier\npopulations on dark energy constraints. We find that outliers whose photo-z\ndistributions are tightly localized about a significantly biased redshift must\nbe controlled to a per-galaxy rate of <~ a few times 10^-3 to insure that\nsystematic errors on dark energy parameters are rendered negligible. In the\ncomplementary limit, a subset of imaged galaxies with uncalibrated photometric\nredshifts distributed over a broad range must be limited to fewer than a\nper-galaxy error rate of <~ a few times 10^-4. Additionally, we explore the\nrelative importance of calibrating the photo-z's of a core set of relatively\nwell-understood galaxies as compared to the need to identify potential\ncatastrophic photo-z outliers. We discuss the degradation of the statistical\nconstraints on dark energy parameters induced by excising source galaxies at\nhigh- and low-photometric redshifts, concluding that removing galaxies with\nz_phot >~ 2.4 and z_phot <~ 0.3 may mitigate damaging catastrophic redshift\noutliers at a relatively small (~ 20%) cost in statistical error. In an\nappendix, we show that forecasts for the degradation in dark energy parameter\nconstraints due to uncertain photometric redshifts depend sensitively on the\ntreatment of the nonlinear matter power spectrum.

First we determine, using a set of\nhydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations, that the CMB temperature floor would\nhave influenced the majority of stars formed at redshifts between z=3 and 6,\nand probably even to higher redshift. Five signatures of CMB-regulated star\nformation are: (1) a higher supernova rate than currently predicted at high\nredshift; (2) a systematic discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements\nof the high redshift star formation rate; (3) a lack of surviving globular\nclusters that formed at high metallicity and high redshift; (4) a more rapid\nrise in the metallicity of cosmic gas than is predicted by current simulations;\nand (5) an enhancement in the abundances of alpha elements such as O and Mg at\nmetallicities -2 < [Fe/H] < -0.5.

Away from linear response, however, this symmetry is not\nfulfilled and the conductance phase of the interferometer when a quantum dot is\ninserted in one of its arms can be a continuous function of the bias voltage.\nSuch magnetoasymmetries have been investigated in related mesoscopic systems\nand arise as a consequence of the asymetric response of the internal potential\nof the conductor out of equilibrium. Here we discuss magnetoasymmetries in\nquantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometers when strong electron-electron\ninteractions are taken into account beyond the mean-field approach. We find\nthat at very low temperatures the asymmetric element of the differential\nconductance shows an abrupt change for voltages around the Fermi level. At\nhigher temperatures we recover a smooth variation of the magnetoasymmetry as a\nfunction of the bias. We illustrate our results with the aid of the electron\noccupation at the dot, demonstrating that its nonequilibrium component is an\nasymmetric function of the flux even to lowest order in voltage. We also\ncalculate the magnetoasymmetry of the current-current correlations (the noise)\nand find that it is given, to a good extent, by the magnetoasymmetry of the\nweakly nonlinear conductance term. Therefore, both magnetoasymmetries (noise\nand conductance) are related to each other via a higher-order\nfluctuation-dissipation relation. This result appears to be true even in the\nlow temperature regime, where Kondo physics and many-body effects dominate the\ntransport properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 18:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

Spectrophotometry for\nthese PNe incorporates an extended optical/near-IR range of 3600-9600 angstroms\nincluding the [S III] lines at 9069 and 9532. We have utilized Emission Line\nSpectrum Analyzer, a five-level atom abundance routine, to determine T_e, N_e,\nionization correction factors, and total element abundances. With a compilation\nof data from >120 Milky Way PNe, we present results from our most recent\nanalysis of abundance patterns in Galactic disk PNe. We have examined the alpha\nelements against H II regions and blue compact galaxies (H2BCG) to discern\nsignatures of depletion or enhancement in PNe progenitor stars, particularly\nthe destruction or production of O and Ne. We present evidence that many PNe\nhave higher Ne/O and lower Ar/Ne ratios compared to H2BCGs within the range of\n8.5-9.0 for 12 + log(O/H). This suggests that Ne is being synthesized in the\nlow- and intermediate-mass progenitors. Sulfur abundances in PNe continue to\nshow great scatter and are systematically lower than those found in H2BCG at a\ngiven metallicity. Although we find that PNe do show some distinction in alpha\nelements when compared to H2BCG, within the Peimbert classification types\nstudied, PNe do not show significant differences in alpha elements amongst\nthemselves, at least to an extent that would distinguish in situ\nnucleosynthesis from the observed dispersion in abundance ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 20:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Existing methods which claim to measure\nthe reduced shears are not necessarily accurate to the second order when a\npoint spread function (PSF) is present. We show that the method of Zhang (2008)\nexactly measures the reduced shears at the second order level in the presence\nof PSF. A simple theorem is provided for further confirming our calculation,\nand for judging the accuracy of any shear measurement method at the second\norder based on its properties at the first order. The method of Zhang (2008) is\nwell defined mathematically. It does not require assumptions on the\nmorphologies of galaxies and the PSF. To reach a sub-percent level accuracy,\nthe CCD pixel size is required to be not larger than 1/3 of the Full Width at\nHalf Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF. Using a large ensemble (> 10^7) of mock\ngalaxies of unrestricted morphologies, we find that contaminations to the shear\nsignals from the noise of background photons can be removed in a well defined\nway because they are not correlated with the source shapes. The residual shear\nmeasurement errors due to background noise are consistent with zero at the\nsub-percent level even when the amplitude of such noise reaches about 1/10 of\nthe source flux within the half-light radius of the source. This limit can in\nprinciple be extended further with a larger galaxy ensemble in our simulations.\nOn the other hand, the source Poisson noise remains to be a cause of systematic\nerrors. For a sub-percent level accuracy, our method requires the amplitude of\nthe source Poisson noise to be less than 1/80 ~ 1/100 of the source flux within\nthe half-light radius of the source, corresponding to collecting roughly 10^4\nsource photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 21:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2011 15:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 01:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2011 19:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It has\nbeen shown that such a \"quantum\" laser can exhibit thresholdless lasing in the\nregime of strong coupling between atom and radiation field.

Using excellent\nstatistics of halos and subhalos (10M at every moment and 50M over the whole\nhistory) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo\nmass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, abundance of\nhalos as function of their circular velocity, the abundance and the spatial\ndistribution of subhalos.

Due to this QSHE, the longitudinal resistance exhibits\nquantum plateaus. The plateau values are at 1/2, 1/6, 3/28, ..., (in the unit\nof $h/e^2$), depending on the filling factors of the spin-up and spin-down\ncarriers. The spin Hall resistance is also investigated and is found to be\nrobust against the disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 03:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In our modelling, the initial orbital\nlocations of Uranus and Neptune (aN) were varied to produce systems in which\nthose planets moved on non-resonant orbits, or in which they lay in their\nmutual 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4 mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In total, 420\nsimulations were carried out, examining 42 different architectures, with a\ntotal of 840000 particles across all runs. In the non-resonant cases, the\nTrojans suffered only moderate levels of dynamical erosion, with the most\ncompact systems (those with aN less than or equal 18 AU) losing around 50% of\ntheir Trojans by the end of the integrations. In the 2:3 and 3:4 MMR scenarios,\nhowever, dynamical erosion was much higher with depletion rates typically\ngreater than 66% and total depletion in the most compact systems. The 1:2\nresonant scenarios featured disruption on levels intermediate between the\nnon-resonant cases and other resonant scenarios, with depletion rates of the\norder of tens of percent. Overall, the great majority of plausible\npre-migration planetary architectures resulted in severe levels of depletion of\nthe Neptunian Trojan clouds. In particular, if Uranus and Neptune formed near\ntheir mutual 2:3 or 3:4 MMR and at heliocentric distances within 18 AU (as\nfavoured by recent studies), we found that the great majority of pre-formed\nTrojans would have been lost prior to Neptune's migration. This strengthens the\ncase for the great bulk of the current Neptunian Trojan population having been\ncaptured during that migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 05:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 15:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-16"}

However, the large radiation dose from serial CBCT\nscans in most IGRT procedures raises a clinical concern, especially for\npediatric patients who are essentially excluded from receiving IGRT for this\nreason. The goal of this work is to develop a fast GPU-based algorithm to\nreconstruct CBCT from undersampled and noisy projection data so as to lower the\nimaging dose. Methods: The CBCT is reconstructed by minimizing an energy\nfunctional consisting of a data fidelity term and a total variation\nregularization term. We developed a GPU-friendly version of the\nforward-backward splitting algorithm to solve this model. A multi-grid\ntechnique is also employed. Results: It is found that 20~40 x-ray projections\nare sufficient to reconstruct images with satisfactory quality for IGRT. The\nreconstruction time ranges from 77 to 130 sec on a NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card,\ndepending on the number of projections used, which is estimated about 100 times\nfaster than similar iterative reconstruction approaches. Moreover, phantom\nstudies indicate that our algorithm enables the CBCT to be reconstructed under\na scanning protocol with as low as 0.1 mAs/projection. Comparing with currently\nwidely used full-fan head and neck scanning protocol of ~360 projections with\n0.4 mAs/projection, it is estimated that an overall 36~72 times dose reduction\nhas been achieved in our fast CBCT reconstruction algorithm. Conclusions: This\nwork indicates that the developed GPU-based CBCT reconstruction algorithm is\ncapable of lowering imaging dose considerably. The high computation efficiency\nin this algorithm makes the iterative CBCT reconstruction approach applicable\nin real clinical environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 07:17:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 17:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Deflation-based\nimplementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its\nvariants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method\nfor deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper.\nThis simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of\nthe kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of\nthe contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a\nfourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed\nalgebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical\nbenefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and\ncomplex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of\nprewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local\nextrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational\ncost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for\nshort data records.

We show that it is possible to separate the optical/near-infrared\n(OIR) jet emission from the OIR disc emission. Focussing on the jet component,\nwe find that as the source fades in the X-ray hard state, the OIR jet emission\nhas a spectral index consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission (alpha\n~ -0.6 to -0.7, where F_nu \\propto nu^alpha). This jet emission is tightly and\nlinearly correlated with the X-ray flux; L_OIR,jet \\propto L_X^(0.98 +- 0.08)\nsuggesting a common origin. This is supported by the OIR, X-ray and OIR to\nX-ray spectral indices being consistent with a single power law (alpha =\n-0.73). Ostensibly the compact, synchrotron jet could therefore account for ~\n100 % of the X-ray flux at low luminosities in the hard state. At the same\ntime, (i) an excess is seen over the power law decay of the X-ray flux at the\npoint in which the jet would start to dominate, (ii) the X-ray spectrum\nslightly softens, which seems to be due to a high energy cut-off or break\nshifting to a lower energy, and (iii) the X-ray rms variability increases. This\nmay be the strongest evidence to date of synchrotron emission from the compact,\nsteady jet dominating the X-ray flux of an X-ray binary. For XTE J1550-564,\nthis is likely to occur within the luminosity range ~ (2 e-4 - 2 e-3) L_Edd on\nthe hard state decline of this outburst. However, on the hard state rise of the\noutburst and initially on the hard state decline, the synchrotron jet can only\nprovide a small fraction (~ a few per cent) of the X-ray flux. Both thermal\nComptonization and the synchrotron jet can therefore produce the hard X-ray\npower law in accreting black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 12:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Similarly, in QM the equations are\ninvariant under particle permutations. Stachel argued that this feature--a\ntheory's `not caring which point, or particle, is which'--supported a\nstructuralist ontology.\n  Pooley criticizes this analogy: in QM the (anti-)symmetrization of fermions\nand bosons implies that each individual state (solution) is fixed by each\npermutation, while in GR a diffeomorphism yields in general a distinct, albeit\nisomorphic, solution.\n  We define various versions of structuralism, and go on to formulate Stachel's\nand Pooley's positions, admittedly in our own terms. We then reply to Pooley.\nThough he is right about fermions and bosons, QM equally allows more general\ntypes of symmetry, in which states (vectors, rays or density operators) are not\nfixed by all permutations (called `paraparticle states').

We here present a broad-band\nX-ray and gamma ray study based on a recent XMM-Newton observation and archival\nINTEGRAL and RXTE data. From the Fermi/LAT 1-year point source catalogue, we\ntentatively associate XSSJ12270-4859 with 1FGLJ1227.9-4852, a source of high\nenergy gamma rays with emission up to 10GeV. We complement the study with UV\nphotometry from XMM-Newton and ground-based optical and near-IR photometry. The\nX-ray emission is highly variable showing flares and intensity dips. The X-ray\nflares consist of flare-dip pairs. Flares are also detected in the UV range but\nnot the dips. Aperiodic dipping behaviour is also observed during X-ray\nquiescence but not in the UV. The 0.2-100keV spectrum is featureless and\ndescribed by a power law model with Gamma=1.7. The 100MeV-10GeV spectrum is\ninstead represented by a power law index of 2.45. The luminosity ratio between\n0.1-100GeV and 0.2--100keV is ~0.8, hence the GeV emission is a significant\ncomponent of the total energy output. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum does not\ngreatly change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence but it\nhardens during the post-flare dips. Optical photometry reveals a period of\n4.32hr likely related to the binary orbit. Near-IR, possibly ellipsoidal,\nvariations are detected. Large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins)\ntimescales are found to be non-periodic. The observed variability at all\nwavelengths and the spectral characteristics strongly favour a low-mass\natypical low-luminosity X-ray binary and are against a Cataclysmic Variable\nnature.

Careful\nanalysis reveals that the time-reversal asymmetry is mainly induced by\nexogenous events. It is also the exogenous events which drive the financial\ndynamics to a non-stationary state.
