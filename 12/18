Giant strain\neffects under external fields are obtained in low symmetric modulated\nmartensitic phases. We outline the origin of modulated phases, their connection\nwith tetragonal martensite and consequences for their functional properties by\nanalysing the martensitic microstructure of epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films from the\natomic to macroscale. Geometrical constraints at an austenite-martensite phase\nboundary act down to the atomic scale. Hence a martensitic microstructure of\nnanotwinned tetragonal martensite can form. Coarsening of twin variants can\nreduce twin boundary energy, a process we could follow from the atomic to the\nmillimetre scale. Coarsening is a fractal process, proceeding in discrete steps\nby doubling twin periodicity. The collective defect energy results in a\nsubstantial hysteresis, which allows retaining modulated martensite as a\nmetastable phase at room temperature. In this metastable state elastic energy\nis released by the formation of a 'twins within twins' microstructure which can\nbe observed from the nanometre to millimetre scale. This hierarchical twinning\nresults in mesoscopic twin boundaries which are diffuse, in contrast to the\ncommon atomically sharp twin boundaries of tetragonal martensite. We suggest\nthat observed extraordinarily high mobility of such mesoscopic twin boundaries\noriginates from their diffuse nature which renders pinning by atomistic point\ndefects ineffective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 16:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 14:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

We prove that the symmetric, nonlinear ground states must\nundergo a symmetry breaking bifurcation if the potential has a non-degenerate\nlocal maxima at zero. Under a generic assumption we show that the bifurcation\nis either subcritical or supercritical pitchfork. In the particular case of\ndouble-well potentials with large separation, the power of nonlinearity\ndetermines the subcritical or supercritical character of the bifurcation. The\nresults are obtained from a careful analysis of the spectral properties of the\nground states at both small and large values for the corresponding eigenvalue\nparameter. We employ a novel technique combining concentration--compactness and\nspectral properties of linearized Schr\\\"odinger type operators to show that the\nsymmetric ground states can either be uniquely continued for the entire\ninterval of the eigenvalue parameter or they undergo a symmetry--breaking\npitchfork bifurcation due to the second eigenvalue of the linearized operator\ncrossing zero. In addition we prove the appropriate scaling for the stationary\nstates in the limit of large values of the eigenvalue parameter. The scaling\nand our novel technique imply that all ground states at large eigenvalues must\nbe localized near a critical point of the potential and bifurcate from the\nsoliton of the focusing NLS equation without potential localized at the same\npoint. The theoretical results are illustrated numerically for a double-well\npotential obtained after the splitting of a single-well potential.

Instead of looking at the expectation value of Polyakov\nloop correlators we study the modifications induced in the chromoelectric flux\nby the presence of the Polyakov loops. In abelian LGTs, thanks to duality, this\nstudy can be performed in a very efficient way, allowing to reach high\nprecision with a reasonable CPU cost. The major advantage of this numerical\nstrategy is that it allows to eliminate the dominant effective string\ncorrection to the inter-quark potential (the Luscher term) thus giving an\nunique opportunity to test higher order corrections. Performing a set of\nsimulations in the 3d gauge Ising model we were thus able to precisely identify\nand measure both the quartic and the sextic effective string corrections to the\ninter-quark potential. While the quartic term perfectly agrees with the\nNambu-Goto one the sextic term is definitely different. Our result seems to\ndisagree with the recent proof by Aharony and Karzbrun of the universality of\nthe sextic correction. We discuss a few possible explanations of this\ndisagreement. The numerical approach described above can also be applied to the\nstudy of Wilson loops. In this case, the numerical results are precise enough\nto test the two-loop prediction of the Nambu-Goto action. The two-loop NG\nresult computed time ago by by Dietz and Filk is incompatible with the data;\nhowever, after correcting some mistakes in their expression, compatibility is\nrestored. The viability of a first-order, operatorial description of the Wilson\nloop is also pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 17:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-20"}

The transient activity is believed to be synchrotron in nature,\nresulting from powerful magnetic reconnection events when the separate magnetic\nstructures of the binary components are capable of interacting and forced to\nreorganize, typically near periastron. We conducted the first systematic study\nof the millimeter variability toward a sample of 12 PMS spectroscopic binaries\nwith the aim to characterize the proliferation of flares amongst sources likely\nto experience similar interbinary reconnection events. The source sample\nconsists of short-period, close-separation binaries that possess either a high\norbital eccentricity or a circular orbit. Using the MAMBO2 array on the IRAM\n30m telescope, we carried out continuous monitoring at 1.25 mm over a 4-night\nperiod during which all of the high-eccentricity binaries approached\nperiastron. We also obtained simultaneous optical VRI measurements, since a\nstrong link is often observed between stellar reconnection events and optical\nbrightenings. UZ Tau E is the only source to be detected at millimeter\nwavelengths: it exhibited significant variation; it is also the only source to\nundergo strong simultaneous optical variability. The binary possesses the\nlargest orbital eccentricity in the current sample, a predicted factor in\nstar-star magnetic interaction events. With orbital parameters and variable\naccretion activity similar to DQ Tau, the millimeter behavior of UZ Tau E draws\nmany parallels to the DQ Tau model for colliding magnetospheres. However, on\nthe basis of our observations alone, we cannot determine whether the\nvariability is repetitive, or if it could also be due to variable free-free\nemission in an ionized wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 17:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

One may let $H(K)$ be the unform\nclosures of all functions in $C(K)$ which are restrictions of harmonic\nfunctions on a neighborhood of $K$, or take $H(K)$ as the subspace of $C(K)$\nconsisting of functions which are finely harmonic on the fine interior of $K$.\nIn \\cite{DG74} it was shown that these definitions are equivalent. Using a\nlocalization result of \\cite{BH78} one sees that a function $h\\in H(K)$ if and\nonly if it is continuous and finely harmonic on on every fine connected\ncomponent of the fine interior of $K$. Such collection of sets are usually\ncalled {\\it restoring}.\n  Another equivalent definition of $H(K)$ was introduced in \\cite{P97} using\nthe notion of Jensen measures which leads another restoring collection of sets.\nThe main goal of this paper is to reconcile the results in \\cite{DG74} and\n\\cite{P97}.\n  To study these spaces, two notions of Green functions have previously been\nintroduced. One by \\cite{P97} as the limit of Green functions on domains $D_j$\nwhere the domains $D_j$ are decreasing to $K$, and alternatively following\n\\cite{F72, F75} one has the fine Green function on the fine interior of $K$.\nOur Theorem \\ref{T:green_equiv} shows that these are equivalent notions.\n  In Section \\ref{S:Jensen} a careful study of the set of Jensen measures on\n$K$, leads to an interesting extension result (Corollary \\ref{C:extend}) for\nsuperharmonic functions. This has a number of applications. In particular we\nshow that the two restoring coverings are the same. We are also able to extend\nsome results of \\cite{GL83} and \\cite{P97} to higher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 20:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-20"}

Generalizing JCAP 1010 (2010) 021, we allow the\nsize of the voids to be arbitrary and the densities of the voids and walls to\nvary in the range 0 < Omega_v < Omega_w < 1. We derive the exact analytic\nresult for the backreaction and consider its series expansion in powers of the\nratio of the void size to the horizon size, r_0/t_0. In addition, we deduce a\nvery simple fitting formula for the backreaction with error less than 1% for\nvoids up to sizes r_0 = t_0. We also construct an exact solution for a network\nof voids with different sizes and densities, leading to a non-zero relative\nvariance of the expansion rate between the voids. While the leading order term\nof the backreaction for a single void-wall pair is of order (r_0/t_0)^2, the\nrelative variance between the different voids in the network is found to be of\norder (r_0/t_0)^4 and thus very small for voids of the observed size.\nFurthermore, we show that even for very large voids, the backreaction is\nsuppressed by an order of magnitude relative to the estimate obtained by\ntreating the walls and voids as disjoint Friedmann solutions. Whether the\nsuppression of the backreaction due to the shear is just a consequence of the\nrestrictions of the used exact models, or a generic feature, has to be\naddressed with more sophisticated solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Follow-up optical and near-IR\nobservations uncover a coincident compact red galaxy, identified as an\nearly-type galaxy at a photometric redshift of z~0.6-0.9 (2-sigma) with a mass\nof 3x10^10 M_Sun, an age of ~1 Gyr, and a luminosity of L_B~0.5L_star.\nSpectroscopic observations of the host reveal a notable break corresponding to\nthe Balmer 4000-Angstrom break at z~0.9, and stellar population spectral\nevolution template fits indicate z~0.915, which we adopt as the redshift of the\nhost, with stellar population ages of ~1-3 Gyr.

We revisit earlier stellar population model\nfitting results, finding that excluding now-known AGNs lowers the typical\nstellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 Myr and ~ 4 x\n10^9 Msol, respectively. We calculate their dust extinction using the Balmer\ndecrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of Av ~ 0.3 mag, similar to\nthat seen in many high-redshift LAEs. Comparing the ratio of Lyalpha/Halpha and\nthe Lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find that\nthe ISMs in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriously\nattenuating the Lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in a\nquasi-clumpy ISM. Lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phase\nmetallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our sample\nhave Z < 0.4 Zsol. We find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift LAE\nanalogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxy\npopulation at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicity\nrelationship. This implies that galaxies with Lyman alpha in emission may be\nsystematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellar\nmass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 02:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The ultra-deep exposure, coupled\nwith the XMM detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate good\nquality X-ray spectra for a large number of X-ray sources and, in particular,\nfor heavily obscured AGN at cosmological redshifts. Specifically we present the\nX-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.\nThe XMM spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron Kalpha line at a\nrest-frame energy of 6.4 keV.

Compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguously\ndetected in both sources.

This dataset combines\nmulti-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic data from space (Spitzer, HST,\nGALEX, and Chandra) and ground-based telescopes. In this paper we use the\nhigh-resolution near-infrared data to recover nuclear structure that is\nobscured by dust at optical wavelengths and measure the evolution in this\nstructure along the merger sequence. A large fraction of all galaxies in our\nsample possess double nuclei (~63%) or show evidence for triple nuclei (~6%).\nHalf of these double nuclei are not visible in the HST B-band images due to\ndust obscuration. The majority of interacting LIRGs have remaining merger\ntimescales of 0.3 to 1.3 Gyrs, based on the projected nuclear separations and\nthe mass ratio of nuclei. We find that the bulge luminosity surface density\nincreases significantly along the merger sequence (primarily due to a decrease\nof the bulge radius), while the bulge luminosity shows a small increase towards\nlate merger stages. No significant increase of the bulge Sersic index is found.\nLIRGs that show no interaction features have on average a significantly larger\nbulge luminosity, suggesting that non merging LIRGs have larger bulge masses\nthan merging LIRGs. This may be related to the flux limited nature of the\nsample and the fact that mergers can significantly boost the IR luminosity of\notherwise low luminosity galaxies. We find that the projected nuclear\nseparation is significantly smaller for ULIRGs (median value of 1.2 kpc) than\nfor LIRGs (mean value of 6.7 kpc), suggesting that the LIRG phase appears\nearlier in mergers than the ULIRG phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The survey covers ~800 square degrees of the inner galaxy (|b|<4\ndegrees) in Stokes I, Q and U parameters at 100 and 150 GHz, with angular\nresolution 5 and 3.5 arcminutes. 505 unique sources are identified in I, of\nwhich 239 are spatially matched between frequency bands, with 50 (216) detected\nat 100 (150) GHz alone; 182 sources are identified as ultracompact HII (UCHII)\nregions. Approximating the distribution of total intensity source fluxes as a\npower-law, we find a slope of $\\gamma_{S,100}=-1.8\\pm0.4$ at 100 GHz, and\n$\\gamma_{S,150}=-2.2\\pm0.4$ at 150 GHz. Similarly, the power-law index of the\nsource two-point angular correlation function is\n$\\gamma_{\\theta,100}=-1.21\\pm0.04$ and $\\gamma_{\\theta,150}=-1.25\\pm0.04$. The\ntotal intensity spectral index distribution peaks at $\\alpha_{I}\\sim0.25$,\nindicating that dust emission is not the only source of radiation produced by\nthese objects between 100 and 150 GHz; free-free radiation is likely\nsignificant in the 100 GHz band. Four sources are detected in polarized\nintensity P, of which three have matching counterparts in I. Three of the\npolarized sources lie close to the galactic center, Sagittarius A*, Sagittarius\nB2 and the Galactic Radio Arc, while the fourth is RCW 49, a bright HII region.\nAn extended polarized source, undetected by the source extraction algorithm on\naccount of its $\\sim0.5^{\\circ}$ size, is identified visually, and is an\nisolated example of large-scale polarized emission oriented distinctly from the\nbulk galactic dust polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2010 06:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The deployment of this\ntechnique requires channel-state information (CSI) feedback from each receiver\nto all interferers, resulting in substantial network overhead. To address this\nissue, this paper proposes the method of distributive control that\nintelligently allocates CSI bits over multiple feedback links and adapts\nfeedback to channel dynamics. For symmetric channel distributions, it is\noptimal for each receiver to equally allocate the average sum-feedback rate for\ndifferent feedback links, thereby decoupling their control. Using the criterion\nof minimum sum-interference power, the optimal feedback-control policy is shown\nusing stochastic-optimization theory to exhibit opportunism. Specifically, a\nspecific feedback link is turned on only when the corresponding transmit-CSI\nerror is significant or interference-channel gain large, and the optimal number\nof feedback bits increases with this gain. For high mobility and considering\nthe sphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, the optimal feedback-control policy is\nshown to perform water-filling in time, where the number of feedback bits\nincreases logarithmically with the corresponding interference-channel gain.\nFurthermore, we consider asymmetric channel distributions with heterogeneous\npath losses and high mobility, and prove the existence of a unique optimal\npolicy for jointly controlling multiple feedback links. Given the\nsphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, this policy is shown to perform water-filling\nover feedback links. Finally, simulation demonstrates that feedback-control\nyields significant throughput gains compared with the conventional\ndifferential-feedback method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2010 09:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2011 16:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 04:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Optical\nreal images are formed by photons. Photons are nonlocal quantum objects that\nexhibit wave-like properties and particle-like properties. Optical real image\nformation is nonlocal because at least two separated object points illuminated\nby a single photon are required for real image formation.

Each plane wave pair that propagates through the imaging system\nultimately arrives at the image plane.

This constitutes a truly\nmicroscopic model of dynamical space-time, where Finsler geometries arise\nnaturally. The D-particle foam model involves point-like brane defects\n(D-particles), which provide the topologically non-trivial foamy structures of\nspace-time. The D-particles can capture and emit stringy matter and this leads\nto a recoil of D-particles. It is indicated how one effect of such a recoil of\nD-particles is a back-reaction on the space-time metric of Finsler type which\nis stochastic. We show that such a type of stochastic space-time foam can lead\nto acceptable cosmologies at late epochs of the Universe, due to the\nnon-trivial properties of the supersymmetric (BPS like) D-particle defects,\nwhich are such so as not to affect significantly the Hubble expansion. The\nrestrictions placed on the free parameters of the Finsler type metric are\nobtained from solving the Boltzmann equation in this background for relic\nabundances of a Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) dark matter candidate.\nIt is demonstrated that the D-foam acts as a source for particle production in\nthe Boltzmann equation, thereby leading to enhanced thermal LSP relic\nabundances relative to those in the Standard LambdaCDM Cosmology. For\nD-particle masses of order TeV, such effects may be relevant for dark matter\nsearches at colliders. The latter constraints complement those coming from high\nenergy gamma-ray astronomy on the induced vacuum refractive index that D-foam\nmodels entail.
