In this paper, rather than learning the\nneeded classifier by optimizing specific performance measure directly, we\ncircumvent this problem by proposing a novel two-step approach called as CAPO,\nnamely to first train nonlinear auxiliary classifiers with existing learning\nmethods, and then to adapt auxiliary classifiers for specific performance\nmeasures. In the first step, auxiliary classifiers can be obtained efficiently\nby taking off-the-shelf learning algorithms. For the second step, we show that\nthe classifier adaptation problem can be reduced to a quadratic program\nproblem, which is similar to linear SVMperf and can be efficiently solved. By\nexploiting nonlinear auxiliary classifiers, CAPO can generate nonlinear\nclassifier which optimizes a large variety of performance measures including\nall the performance measure based on the contingency table and AUC, whilst\nkeeping high computational efficiency. Empirical studies show that CAPO is\neffective and of high computational efficiency, and even it is more efficient\nthan linear SVMperf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2010 16:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 08:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 11:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The key to\nintelligence1 is learning relationships between large numbers of signals (such\nas pixel values), rather than memorizing explicit patterns. Causes (such as\nobjects) can then be inferred from a learned internal model. These\nrelationships fall into 2 classes: simple pairwise or second-order correlations\n(socs), and complex, and vastly more numerous, higher-order correlations\n(hocsB), such as the product of 3 or more pixels averaged over a set of images.\nThus if 3 pixels correlate, they may give an \"edge\". Neurons with \"Hebbian\"\nsynapses (changing strength in response to input-output spike-coincidences) are\nsensitive to such correlations, and it's likely that learned internal models\nuse such neurons. Because output firing depends on input firing via the\nrelevant connection strengths, Hebbian learning provides, in a feedback manner,\nsensitivity to input correlations. Hocs are vital, since they express\n\"interesting\" structure2 (e.g. edges), but their detection requires nonlinear\nrules operating at synapses of individual neurons.

One is subordinated to another. We want to give an estimate of\n$L^p$-norm of a subordinated one via the same norm of a dominating one. In this\nsetting this was done by Burkholder in \\cite{Bu1}--\\cite{Bu8}. If one of the\nmartingales is orthogonal, the constant should drop. This was demonstrated in\n\\cite{BaJ1}, when the orthogonality is attached to the subordinated martingale\nand when $2\\le p<\\infty$. This note contains an (almost obvious) observation\nthat the same idea can be used in the case when the orthogonality is attached\nto a dominating martingale and $1<p\\le 2$. Two other complementary regimes are\nconsidered in \\cite{BJV_La}. When both martingales are orthogonal, see\n\\cite{BJV_Le}. In these two papers the constants are sharp. We are not sure of\nthe sharpness of the constant in the present note.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2010 20:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-07"}

In order to\nunderstand the formation processes of massive stars the physical and chemical\nconditions in infrared dark clouds have to be characterized. The goal of this\npaper is to investigate the chemical composition of a sample of southern\ninfrared dark clouds. One important aspect of the observations is to check, if\nthe molecular abuncances in IRDCs are similar to the low-mass pre-stellar\ncores, or whether they show signatures of more evolved evolutionary stages. We\nperformed observations toward 15 IRDCs in the frequency range between 86 and 93\nGHz using the 22-m Mopra radio telescope. We detect HNC, HCO$^+$ and HNC\nemission in all clouds and N$_2$H$^+$ in all IRDCs except one. In some clouds\nwe detect SiO emission. Complicated shapes of the HCO$^+$ emission line profile\nare found in all IRDCs. Both signatures indicates the presence of infall and\noutflow motions and beginning of star formation activity, at least in some\nparts of the IRDCs. Where possible, we calculate molecular abundances and make\na comparison with previously obtained values for low-mass pre-stellar cores and\nhigh-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs).

As the small circulation\ntends to zero, the weak vortices tend to a circle centered on the strong\nvortex. A special potential function of this limiting problem can be used to\ncharacterize orbits and stability. Whenever a critical point of this function\nis nondegenerate, we prove that the orbit can be continued, and its linear\nstability is determined by properties of the potential. For $N\\geq 3$ there are\nat least three distinct families of critical points associated to the limiting\nproblem. Assuming nondegeneracy, one of these families continues to a linearly\nstable class of relative equilibria with small and large circulation of the\nsame sign. This class becomes unstable as the small circulation passes through\nzero and changes sign. Another family of critical points which is always\nnondegenerate continues to a configuration with small vortices arranged in an\n$N$-gon about the strong central vortex. This class of relative equilibria is\nlinearly unstable regardless of the sign of the small circulation when $N\\geq\n4$. Numerical results suggest that the third family of critical points of the\nlimiting problem also continues to a linearly unstable class of solutions of\nthe full problem independent of the sign of the small circulation. Thus there\nis evidence that linearly stable relative equilibria exist when the large and\nsmall circulation strengths are of the same sign, but that no such solutions\nexist when they have opposite signs. The results of this paper are in contrast\nto those of the analogous celestial mechanics problem, for which the $N$-gon is\nthe only relative equilibrium for $N$ sufficiently large, and is linearly\nstable if and only if $N\\geq 7$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2010 15:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The data are presented for central and peripheral\ncollisions, corresponding to 0-5% and 70-80% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross\nsection. The measured charged particle spectra in $|\\eta|<0.8$ and $0.3 < p_T <\n20$ GeV/$c$ are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification\nfactor $R_{\\rm AA}$. The result indicates only weak medium effects ($R_{\\rm AA}\n\\approx $ 0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, $R_{\\rm AA}$\nreaches a minimum of about 0.14 at $p_{\\rm T}=6$-7GeV/$c$ and increases\nsignificantly at larger $p_{\\rm T}$. The measured suppression of high-$p_{\\rm\nT}$ particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies,\nindicating that a very dense medium is formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at\nthe LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2010 15:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 18:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

These fluctuation theorems provide\nsymmetries individually to the distributions of physical quantities like the\nclassical work ($W_c$), thermodynamic work ($W$), total entropy ($\\Delta\ns_{tot}$) and dissipated heat ($Q$), when the system is driven arbitrarily out\nof equilibrium. All these quantities can be defined for individual\ntrajectories. We have studied the number of trajectories which exhibit\nbehaviour unexpected at the macroscopic level. As the time of observation\nincreases, the fraction of such atypical trajectories decreases, as expected at\nmacroscale. Nature of distributions for the thermodynamic work and the entropy\nproduction in nonlinear models may exhibit peak (most probable value) in the\natypical regime without violating the expected average behaviour.

However, in quantum field theory it\nhas been shown that the energy density can be negative. There are restrictions,\ncalled the quantum inequalities, on the amount of negative energy that can\nexist in some region of space and time. In this paper we will focus on the\nspatial quantum inequality as it applies to a massless scalar field in 1-1\ndimensional space-time. The spatial quantum inequality is a restriction on the\namount of negative energy that can exist in a region of space at a given time.\nIt will be shown that we can specify a quantum state which violates the spatial\nquantum inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2010 20:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}
