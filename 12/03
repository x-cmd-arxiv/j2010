We have determined non-LTE\nabundances of Na and LTE abundances for the remaining 21 elements, including O,\nMg, Al, alpha, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements, many of which have not\npreviously been analysed for this cluster. We have also considered the\ninfluence of possible He enrichment in the analysis of stellar spectra.

During further processing in higher areas,\ninformation is subjected to a certain condensation process, which results in\nformation of abstract conceptual images of external world, apparently,\nrepresented as certain uniform spiking activity partially independent on the\ninput spike trains details. Possible physical mechanism of condensation at the\nlevel of individual neuron was discussed recently. In a reverberating spiking\nneural network, due to this mechanism the dynamics should settle down to the\nsame uniform/periodic activity in response to a set of various inputs. Since\nthe same periodic activity may correspond to different input spike trains, we\ninterpret this as possible candidate for information condensation mechanism in\na network. Our purpose is to test this possibility in a network model\nconsisting of five fully connected neurons, particularly, the influence of\ngeometric size of the network, on its ability to condense information. Dynamics\nof 20 spiking neural networks of different geometric sizes are modelled by\nmeans of computer simulation. Each network was propelled into reverberating\ndynamics by applying various initial input spike trains. We run the dynamics\nuntil it becomes periodic. The Shannon's formula is used to calculate the\namount of information in any input spike train and in any periodic state found.\nAs a result, we obtain explicit estimate of the degree of information\ncondensation in the networks, and conclude that it depends strongly on the\nnet's geometric size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 16:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 16:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

From its distant orbit around L2 it needs to transmit a huge\nquantity of information through a very limited bandwidth. This is especially\ntrue for the PACS imaging camera which needs to compress its data far more than\nwhat can be achieved with lossless compression. This is currently solved by\nincluding lossy averaging and rounding steps on board. Recently, a new theory\ncalled compressed-sensing emerged from the statistics community. This theory\nmakes use of the sparsity of natural (or astrophysical) images to optimize the\nacquisition scheme of the data needed to estimate those images. Thus, it can\nlead to high compression factors.\n  A previous article by Bobin et al. (2008) showed how the new theory could be\napplied to simulated Herschel/PACS data to solve the compression requirement of\nthe instrument. In this article, we show that compressed-sensing theory can\nindeed be successfully applied to actual Herschel/PACS data and give\nsignificant improvements over the standard pipeline. In order to fully use the\nredundancy present in the data, we perform full sky map estimation and\ndecompression at the same time, which cannot be done in most other compression\nmethods. We also demonstrate that the various artifacts affecting the data\n(pink noise, glitches, whose behavior is a priori not well compatible with\ncompressed-sensing) can be handled as well in this new framework. Finally, we\nmake a comparison between the methods from the compressed-sensing scheme and\ndata acquired with the standard compression scheme. We discuss improvements\nthat can be made on ground for the creation of sky maps from the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 17:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

By\ncollapsing the power spectrum we have obtained a quite constant splitting for\nthese patterns in comparison to regions where no g modes were expected.\nMoreover, the same technique applied to simultaneous VIRGO/SoHO data unveils\nsome common signals between the power spectra of both instruments. Thus, we are\nable to identify and characterize individual g modes with their central\nfrequencies, amplitudes and splittings allowing to do seismic inversions of the\nrotation profile inside the solar core. These results open a new light on the\nphysics and dynamics of the solar deep core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 17:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We study systematically the charge and spin transport properties\ndepending on the number of layers and the electrical back gating of the device.\nWe explain the charge transport measurements by taking the screening of\nscattering potentials into account and use the results to understand the spin\ndata. The measured samples are between 3 and 20 layers thick and we include in\nour analysis our earlier results of the measurements on SLG for comparison. In\nour room temperature spin transport measurements we manage to observe spin\nsignals over distances up to 10 u m and measure spin-relaxation times up to\ntau_s ~500 ps, about 4 times higher than in SLG. We calculate the density of\nstates (DOS) of FLG using a zone-folding scheme to determine the charge\ndiffusion coefficient D_C from the square resistance R_S. The resulting D_C and\nthe spin diffusion coefficient D_S show similar values and depend only weakly\non the number of layers and gate induced charge carriers. We discuss the\nimplications of this on the identification of the spin-relaxation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 18:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2011 11:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

For example, the initial-state and\nfinal-state interactions of the quarks and gluons entering perturbative QCD\nhard-scattering subprocesses lead to the breakdown of traditional concepts of\nfactorization and universality for transverse-momentum-dependent observables at\nleading twist. These soft-gluon rescattering effect produce single-spin\nasymmetries, the breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as\nwell as diffractive deep inelastic scattering, The antishadowing of nuclear\nstructure functions is predicted to depend on the flavor quantum numbers of\neach quark and antiquark. Isolated hadrons can be produced at large transverse\nmomentum directly within a hard higher-twist QCD subprocess, rather than from\njet fragmentation, even at the LHC. Such \"direct\" processes can explain the\nobserved deviations from pQCD predictions of the power-law fall-off of\ninclusive hadron cross sections as well as the \"baryon anomaly\" seen in\nhigh-centrality heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The intrinsic charm contribution\nto the proton structure function at high x can explain the large rate for high\np_T photon plus charm-jet events observed at the Tevatron and imply a large\nproduction rate for charm and bottom jets at high p_T at the LHC, as well as a\nnovel mechanism for Higgs and Z^0 production at high x_F. The light-front\nwavefunctions derived in AdS/QCD can be used to calculate jet hadronization at\nthe amplitude level. The elimination of the renormalization scale ambiguity for\nthe QCD coupling using the scheme-independent BLM method will increase the\nsensitivity of searches for new physics at the LHC. The implications of\n\"in-hadron condensates\" for the QCD contribution to the cosmological constant\nare also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 19:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

However, additional\nplanetary formation and evolution routes may exist in old evolved binary\nsystems. Here we discuss the implications of binary stellar evolution on\nplanetary systems. In these binary systems stellar evolution could lead to the\nformation of symbiotic stars, where mass is lost from one star and could be\ntransferred to its binary companion, and may form an accretion disk around it.\nThis raises the possibility that such a disk could provide the necessary\nenvironment for the formation of a new, second generation of planets in both\ncircumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation\nplanets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems would be dynamically\neffected by the mass loss in the systems and may also interact with the newly\nformed disk. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in\nwhite dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most\nnotably, second generation planets could form in environment which are\ninaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The orbital\nphase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in\nterms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the pre-evolved\nprogenitor binaries. Observations of exo-planets in such forbidden or\nunfavorable regions could possibly serve to uniquely identify their second\ngeneration character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second\ngeneration planetary systems, including Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the\ncurrently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin\nfor these systems could naturally explain their unique configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 21:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 18:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Clues as to where such systems might\nexist are therefore highly desirable.

For the first time, we apply GW extraction methods\nin core collapse that are fully curvature-based and valid for strongly\nradiating and highly relativistic sources.

This process has been given relatively little attention\nso far, and its properties remain poorly constrained. In this paper, we present\nand analyze a set of three-dimensional simulations of this phenomenon in a\nCartesian domain under the Boussinesq approximation. We find that in some cases\nthe double-diffusive convection saturates into a state of homogeneous\nturbulence, but with turbulent fluxes several orders of magnitude smaller than\nthose expected from direct overturning convection. In other cases the system\nrapidly and spontaneously develops closely-packed thermo-compositional layers,\nwhich later successively merge until a single layer is left. We compare the\noutput of our simulations with an existing theory of layer formation in the\noceanographic context, and find very good agreement between the model and our\nresults. The thermal and compositional mixing rates increase significantly\nduring layer formation, and increase even further with each merger. We find\nthat the heat flux through the staircase is a simple function of the layer\nheight. We conclude by proposing a new approach to studying transport by\ndouble-diffusive convection in astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 01:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However in many practical situations of interest, models are\nconstrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom\nrelative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to\nconvert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in\nconvex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The\nclass of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms\nfrom some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include\nwell-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as\nseveral others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,\northogonal matrices, and atomic measures. The convex programming formulation is\nbased on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this\nnorm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm\nball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering\nsimple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp\nestimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust\nrecovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on\ncomputing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball. When\nthe atomic set has algebraic structure the resulting optimization problems can\nbe solved or approximated via semidefinite programming. The quality of these\napproximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery. Thus\nthis work extends the catalog of simple models that can be recovered from\nlimited linear information via tractable convex programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 01:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2011 05:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 23:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

The parameters of the nonlocal model are\nrefitted so that the physical values of the pion mass and the weak pion decay\nconstant are obtained. The size of the 1/Nc correction to the quark condensate\nis carefully studied and compared with the usual local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. It is found that even the sign of the corrections can be different. This\ncan be attributed to the mesonic cut-off of the local model. The model is also\napplied to finite temperature. We find that the 1/Nc corrections dominate the\nmelting of the chiral condensate at low temperatures, T<100 MeV, in agreement\nwith chiral perturbation theory. On the other hand, the relative importance of\nthe 1/Nc corrections in the cross-over regime depends on the parameter T0 of\nthe Polyakov loop potential. For T0=270 MeV, corresponding to a fit of lattice\ndata for pure gluodynamics, the correction terms are large and lead to a\nlowering of the chiral phase transition temperature in comparison with the\nmean-field result. Near the phase transition the 1/Nc expansion breaks down and\na non-perturbative scheme is needed to include mesonic correlations in that\nregime. Lowering T0 leads to a more rapid cross-over even at the mean-field\nlevel and the unstable region for the 1/Nc corrections shrinks. For T0< 220 MeV\nthe temperatures of deconfinement and chiral restoration are practically\nsynchronized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 09:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2011 13:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 10:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Our aim is to compare an impurity-free\nconductor with grain boundaries with a grain-free conductor with impurity\ndisorder. A single grain boundary is modeled as a set of the\n2D-$\\delta$-function-like barriers positioned equidistantly on a straight line\nand disorder is emulated by a large number of such straight lines, intersecting\nthe conductor with random orientation in random positions. The impurity\ndisorder is modeled by the 2D $\\delta$-barriers with the randomly chosen\npositions and signs. The electron transmission through the wires is calculated\nby the scattering-matrix method, and the Landauer conductance is obtained. We\ncalculate the persistent current in the rings threaded by magnetic flux: We\nincorporate into the scattering-matrix method the flux-dependent cyclic\nboundary conditions and we introduce a trick allowing to study the persistent\ncurrents in rings of almost realistic size. We mainly focus on the numerical\nresults for L much larger than the electron mean-free path, when the transport\nis diffusive. If the grain boundaries are weakly reflecting, the systems with\ngrain boundaries show the same (mean) conductance and the same (typical)\npersistent current as the systems with impurities, and the results also agree\nwith the single-particle theories treating disorder as a white-noise-like\npotential. If the grain boundaries are strongly reflecting, the typical\npersistent currents can be about three times larger than the results of the\nwhite-noise-based theory, thus resembling the experimental results of Jariwala\net al. (PRL 2001). We extend our study to the 3D conductors with columnar\ngrains.

Its importance stems from\nthe expected substantial jump in the abundance of solids beyond the snow line,\nwhich is conducive to planet formation, and from the higher stickiness in\ncollisions of ice-coated dust grains, which may help the process of coagulation\nof dust and the formation of planetesimals. In an optically thin nebula, the\nlocation of the snow line is easily calculated to be around 3 AU. However, in\nits first 5 to 10 million years, the solar nebula was optically thick, implying\na smaller snow line radius due to shielding from direct sunlight, but also a\nlarger radius because of viscous heating. Several models have attempted to\ntreat these opposing effects. However, until recently treatments beyond an\napproximate 1+1D radiative transfer were unfeasible. We revisit the problem\nwith a fully self-consistent 3D treatment in an axisymmetric disk model,\nincluding a density-dependent treatment of the dust and ice sublimation. We\nfind that the location of the snow line is very sensitive to the opacities of\nthe dust grains and the mass accretion rate of the disk. We show that previous\napproximate treatments are quite efficient at determining the location of the\nsnow line if the energy budget is locally dominated by viscous accretion. We\nderive an analytic estimate of the location of the snow line that compares very\nwell with results from this and previous studies. Using solar abundances of the\nelements we compute the abundance of dust and ice and find that the expected\njump in solid surface density at the snow line is smaller than previously\nassumed. We further show that in the inner few AU the refractory species are\npartly evaporated, leading to a significantly smaller solid state surface\ndensity in the regions where the rocky planets were formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 13:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Absorption within the nonlinear medium is\naccounted for by employing the framework of macroscopic QED and the Green\ntensor quantization of the electromagnetic field. An effective interaction\nHamiltonian, which describes the nonlinear interaction of the electric field\nand the linear noise polarization field, is used to derive the quantum state of\nthe light leaving a nonlinear crystal. The signal and idler modes of this\nquantum state are found to be a superpositions of the electric and noise\npolarization fields. Using this state, the expression for the coincident count\nrates for both Type I and Type II conversion are found. The nonlinear\ninteraction with the noise polarization field were shown to cause an increase\nin the rate on the order of 10^{-12} for absorption of 10% per cm. This\nastonishingly small effect is found to be negligible compared to the decay\ncaused by linear absorption of the propagating modes. From the expressions for\nthe biphoton amplitude it can be seen the maximally entangled states can still\nbe produced even in the presence of strong absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 15:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 15:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In terms of the associated optimization problem,\ncomputing linear eigenvectors amounts to finding critical points of a quadratic\nfunction subject to quadratic constraints. In this paper we show that a certain\nclass of constrained optimization problems with nonquadratic objective and\nconstraints can be understood as nonlinear eigenproblems. We derive a\ngeneralization of the inverse power method which is guaranteed to converge to a\nnonlinear eigenvector. We apply the inverse power method to 1-spectral\nclustering and sparse PCA which can naturally be formulated as nonlinear\neigenproblems. In both applications we achieve state-of-the-art results in\nterms of solution quality and runtime. Moving beyond the standard eigenproblem\nshould be useful also in many other applications and our inverse power method\ncan be easily adapted to new problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 15:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
