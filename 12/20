The density is assumed to be smooth, have bounded support, and\nbe uniformly bounded from below on this set. Unlike previous $k$-NN estimators\nof non-linear density functionals, the proposed estimator uses data-splitting\nand boundary correction to achieve lower mean square error. Specifically, we\nassume that $T$ i.i.d. samples ${X}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ from the density are\nsplit into two pieces of cardinality $M$ and $N$ respectively, with $M$ samples\nused for computing a k-nearest-neighbor density estimate and the remaining $N$\nsamples used for empirical estimation of the integral of the density\nfunctional. By studying the statistical properties of k-NN balls, explicit\nrates for the bias and variance of the BPI estimator are derived in terms of\nthe sample size, the dimension of the samples and the underlying probability\ndistribution. Based on these results, it is possible to specify optimal choice\nof tuning parameters $M/T$, $k$ for maximizing the rate of decrease of the mean\nsquare error (MSE). The resultant optimized BPI estimator converges faster and\nachieves lower mean squared error than previous $k$-NN entropy estimators.

In this work it is shown how one can exploit the Equation Free\napproach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge\ndetailed individual-based epidemic simulation with coarse-grained,\nsystems-level, analysis. The methodology provides a systematic approach for\nanalyzing the parametric behavior of complex/ multi-scale epidemic simulators\nmuch more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how\nsteady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability\ncomputations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be\nperformed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a\nsimple individual-based epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected\ngraph. Using the individual-based microscopic simulator as a black box\ncoarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute\nthe coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of\nthe stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures\nat the macroscopic level under a pairwise representation perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2010 19:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

Depending on the eccentricity of the semi-ellipse and the width\nand placement of the leads, high transmittivity at zero magnetic field is\nreached either through states guided along the curved boundary or focused onto\nthe straight boundary of the billiard. For small eccentricity, attachment of\nleads at the ellipse foci can yield optimized corresponding transmission, while\ndepartures from this behavior demonstrate the inapplicability of classical\nconsiderations in the deep quantum regime. The geometrically determined\ntransmission is altered by the phase-modulating and deflecting effect of the\nmagnetic field, which switches the pairs of leads connected by high\ntransmittivity. It is shown that the elliptic boundary is responsible for these\nvery special transport properties. At higher field strengths edge states form\nand the multiterminal transmission coefficients are determined by the topology\nof the billiard. The combination of magnetotransport with geometrically\noptimized transmission behavior leads to an efficient control of the current\nthrough the multiterminal structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2010 20:29:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 08:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-06"}

In this thesis,\nwe argue however that these signals are plagued by irreducible astrophysical\nbackgrounds and show how plausible conventional physics can mimic the alleged\ndark matter signals. In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise\nin the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the\nproduction through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration\nof positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources. Fitting\nour result for the total electron-positron flux measured by the Fermi satellite\nallows us to fix the only free parameter of the model and make an independent\nprediction for the positron fraction. This model can be tested by considering\nsimilar effects expected for nuclear secondary-to-primary ratios such as B/C. A\nrise predicted above O(100) GeV/n would be an unique confirmation of our\nexplanation for a rising positron fraction and rule out the dark matter\nexplanation. Furthermore, we review the assumptions made in the extraction of\nthe `WMAP haze' which has also been claimed to be due to electrons and\npositrons from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic centre region. We argue\nthat the energy-dependence of their diffusion makes the extraction of the haze\nthrough template fitting unreliable. The systematic effects introduced by this\ncan, under specific circumstances, reproduce the residual, suggesting that the\n`haze' may be just an artefact of the template subtraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 05:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-21"}

In this paper we propose a\nrobust rank correlation screening (RRCS) method to deal with ultra-high\ndimensional data. The new procedure is based on the Kendall \\tau correlation\ncoefficient between response and predictor variables rather than the Pearson\ncorrelation of existing methods. The new method has four desirable features\ncompared with existing independence screening methods. First, the sure\nindependence screening property can hold only under the existence of a second\norder moment of predictor variables, rather than exponential tails or\nalikeness, even when the number of predictor variables grows as fast as\nexponentially of the sample size. Second, it can be used to deal with\nsemiparametric models such as transformation regression models and single-index\nmodels under monotonic constraint to the link function without involving\nnonparametric estimation even when there are nonparametric functions in the\nmodels.

Kraus\noperators are employed to bring out the manner in which the unphysical matrix\ntransposition map when accompanied by injection of a threshold classical noise\nbecomes a physical channel. The action of the quantum-limited attenuator and\namplifier channels as simply scaling maps on suitable quasi-probabilities in\nphase space is examined in the Kraus picture. Consideration of cumulants is\nused to examine the issue of fixed points. In the cases of\nentanglement-breaking channels a description in terms of rank one Kraus\noperators is shown to emerge quite simply. In contradistinction, it is shown\nthat there is not even one finite rank operator in the entire linear span of\nKraus operators of the quantum-limited amplifier or attenuator families, an\nassertion far stronger than the statement that these are not entanglement\nbreaking channels. A characterization of extremality in terms of Kraus\noperators, originally due to Choi, is employed to show that all quantum-limited\nGaussian channels are extremal. The fact that every noisy Gaussian channel can\nbe realised as product of a pair of quantum-limited channels is used to\nconstruct a discrete set of linearly independent Kraus operators for noisy\nGaussian channels, including the classical noise channel, and these Kraus\noperators have a particularly simple structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 09:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We\nsolve the optimization explicitly for relevant families of states, including\nsqueezed thermal states. Remarkably, we find that there is a finite subset of\ntwo-mode Gaussian states, comprising pure states, where non-Gaussian\nmeasurements such as photon counting are globally optimal for the AMID and\nrealize a strictly smaller state disturbance compared to the best Gaussian\nmeasurements. However, for the majority of two--mode Gaussian states the\nunoptimized MID provides a loose overestimation of the actual content of\nquantum correlations, as evidenced by its comparison with Gaussian discord.\nThis feature displays strong similarity with the case of two qubits.

In contrast, the decay\nmode $\\bar{B_{d}^0} \\rightarrow \\, \\pi^0 \\pi^{0} $ has a small factorized\ncontribution, being proportional to a small Wilson coefficient combination.\nHowever, for the decay mode $\\bar{B_{d}^0} \\rightarrow \\, \\pi^0 \\pi^{0} $ there\nis a sizeable nonfactorizable (color suppressed) contribution due to soft (long\ndistance) interactions, which dominate the amplitude. We estimate the branching\nratio for the mode $\\bar{B_{d}^0} \\rightarrow \\, \\pi^0 \\pi^{0} $ in the heavy\nquark limit for the $b$- quark. In order to estimate color suppressed\ncontributions we treat the energetic light ($u,d,s$) quark within a variant of\nLarge Energy Effective Theory combined with a recent extension of chiral quark\nmodels in terms of model- dependent gluon condensates. We find that our\ncalculated color suppressed amplitude is suppressed by a factor of order\n$\\Lambda_{QCD}/m_b$ with respect to the factorizable amplitude, as it should\naccording to QCD-factorization. Further, for reasonable values of the\nconstituent quark mass and the gluon condensate, the calculated nonfactorizable\namplitude for $\\bar{B_{d}^0} \\rightarrow \\, \\pi^0 \\pi^{0} $ can easily\naccomodate the experimental value. Unfortunately, the color suppressed\namplitude is very sensitive to the values of these model dependent parameters.\nTherefore fine-tuning is necessary in order to obtain an amplitude compatible\nwith the experimental result for $\\bar{B_{d}^0} \\rightarrow \\, \\pi^0 \\pi^{0} $.\nA possible link to the triangle anomaly is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 13:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

The gradual and impulsive emission components\nare believed to be associated with, respectively, the thermal and nonthermal\ncomponents identified in spectral fitting. In this paper, a prominent about 50\nsecond hard X-ray (HXR) pulse of a simple GOES class C7.5 flare on 20 February\n2002 is used to study the association between high energy, non-thermal and\nimpulsive evolution, and low energy, thermal and gradual evolution. We use\nregularized methods to obtain time derivatives of photon fluxes to quantify the\ntime evolution as a function of photon energy, obtaining a break energy between\nimpulsive and gradual behavior. These break energies are consistent with a\nconstant value of about 11 keV in agreement with those found spectroscopically\nbetween thermal and non-thermal components, but the relative errors of the\nformer are greater than 15% and much greater than the a few percent errors\nfound from the spectral fitting. These errors only weakly depend on assuming an\nunderlying spectral model for the photons, pointing to the current data being\ninadequate to reduce the uncertainties rather than there being a problem\nassociated with an assumed model. The time derivative method is used to test\nfor the presence of a 'pivot energy' in this flare. Although these pivot\nenergies are marginally consistent with a constant value of about 9 keV, its\nvalues in the HXR rise phase appear to be lower than those in the decay phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 14:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Control parameters such as the gap\nwidth, the strain rate, and the gel concentration are systematically varied.

Below\n[Fe/H]=-2.0, [S/Fe] remains constant or it decreases with [Fe/H], depending on\nthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. Moreover, although sulfur is\nnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ISM, it seems to behave\ndifferently in DLAs and in old metal-poor stars. We aim to determine precise S\nabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account NLTE\nand 3D effects. NLTE profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of SI have been\ncomputed using a new model atom for S. We find sulfur in EMP stars to behave\nlike the other alpha-elements, with [S/Fe] remaining approximately constant for\n[Fe/H]<-3. However, [S/Mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [Mg/H].\nThe overall abundance patterns of O, Na, Mg, Al, S, and K are best matched by\nthe SN model yields by Heger & Woosley. The [S/Zn] ratio in EMP stars is solar,\nas found also in DLAs. We obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,\n[S/Fe] < +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star CS 22949-037. This, along with a\nprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that the\nlight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hyper\nmetal-poor stars HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 15:31:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2011 08:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Carr used this condition to\nobtain an upper bound for the density fluctuation amplitude with the property\nthat for smaller amplitudes the formation of a primordial black hole is\npossible, while larger ones indicate a separate universe.

After a brief description of the motivations and the challenges of\nconsidering tau leptons in high energy hadronic collisions, details of the tau\nreconstruction and identification will be discussed. The challenges associated\nfor tau energy measurements in an hadronic environment will be presented\nincluding approaches to deal with such measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2010 20:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}
