The scope of the\nreview is further restricted to the issue of predicting the amplitude (and\noptionally the epoch) of an upcoming solar maximum no later than right after\nthe start of the given cycle. Prediction methods form three main groups.\nPrecursor methods rely on the value of some measure of solar activity or\nmagnetism at a specified time to predict the amplitude of the following solar\nmaximum. Their implicit assumption is that each numbered solar cycle is a\nconsistent unit in itself, while solar activity seems to consist of a series of\nmuch less tightly intercorrelated individual cycles. Extrapolation methods, in\ncontrast, are based on the premise that the physical process giving rise to the\nsunspot number record is statistically homogeneous, i.e., the mathematical\nregularities underlying its variations are the same at any point of time, and\ntherefore it lends itself to analysis and forecasting by time series methods.\nFinally, instead of an analysis of observational data alone, model based\npredictions use physically (more or less) consistent dynamo models in their\nattempts to predict solar activity. In their overall performance precursor\nmethods have clearly been superior to extrapolation methods. Nevertheless, some\nextrapolation methods may still be worth further study. Model based forecasts\nhave not yet have had a chance to prove their skills. One method that has\nyielded predictions consistently in the right range during the past few solar\ncycles is that of K. Schatten et al., whose approach is mainly based on the\npolar field precursor. The incipient cycle 24 will probably mark the end of the\nModern Maximum, with the Sun switching to a state of less strong activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2010 13:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 16:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this\npaper we study the interaction of sterile neutrinos with atoms and their role\non ionization of atoms in MeV and GeV energy scale. We also study the\ninteraction of sterile neutrinos with nuclei in the MeV and GeV energy scale.\nWe obtain the relevant cross sections for both these two interactions. Finally\nwe compare our results with the results of keV energy range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2010 15:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 12:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-23"}

The interior of the black hole is modelled by a\nnoncommutative extension of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We compute the\ntemperature and entropy of a Kantowski-Sachs black hole and compare our results\nwith the Hawking values. Again, the noncommutativity in the momenta sector\nallows us to have a minimum in the potential, which is relevant in order to\napply the Feynman-Hibbs procedure. For Kantowski-Sachs black holes, the same\nmodel is shown to generate a non-unitary dynamics, predicting vanishing total\nprobability in the neighborhood of the singularity. This result effectively\nregularizes the Kantowski-Sachs singularity and generalizes a similar result,\npreviously obtained for the case of Schwarzschild black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2010 15:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}
