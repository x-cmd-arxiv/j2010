It is shown that repulsive\ncoupling generates out-of-phase oscillations, while diffusive coupling\ngenerates synchronous oscillations. Specifically, symmetric solutions and their\ncorresponding amplitudes are derived, and contraction analysis is used to prove\nglobal stability and convergence of oscillations to either symmetric\nout-of-phase or synchronous states, depending on the coupling constant.

Using a collective particle approximation of Physarum\npolycephalum we found matching correlates of electrical potential in\ncomputational simulations by measuring local population flux at the node\npositions, generating trains of high and low frequency oscillatory behaviour.\nMotifs present in these measurements matched the response `grammar' of the\nplasmodium when encountering new nodes, simulated consumption of nutrients,\nexposure to simulated hazardous illumination and sclerotium formation. The\ndistributed computation of the particle collective was able to calculate\nbeneficial network structures and sclerotium position by shifting the active\ngrowth zone of the simulated plasmodium. The results show future promise for\nthe non-invasive study of the complex dynamical behaviour within --- and health\nstatus of --- living systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 17:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

The analysis of deep spectra taken at the KECK telescope allows us to infer\nthe physical properties (the electron and total density, ne and nh, the\nionisation fraction, xe, and the temperature, te) and the spatial distribution\nof the velocity components in the two jet lobes. The presence of dust grains in\nthe jet is investigated by estimating the gas-phase abundance of calcium with\nrespect to its solar value. At the base of the jet the lines are broad (~100\nkm/s) and up to three velocity components are detected. At 5\" from the source,\nhowever, only the denser and more excited high velocity components survive and\nthe lines are narrower (~10-30 km/s). The jet is strongly asymmetric both in\nvelocity and in its physical structure. The red lobe, slower (~140 km/s) and\nmore collimated, presents low ionisation fractions (xe~0.1-0.4) and\ntemperatures (te<5e3 K), while the total density is up to ~2.5e4 ccm.

It is well-known that new\nK-rational points may be obtained from old ones by secant and tangent\nconstructions. A Mordell-Weil generating set is a subset B of S(K) of minimal\ncardinality which generates S(K) via successive secant and tangent\nconstructions. Let r(S,K) be the cardinality of such a Mordell-Weil generating\nset. Manin posed what is known as the Mordell-Weil problem for cubic surfaces:\nif K is finitely generated over its prime subfield then r(S,K) is finite. In\nthis paper, we prove a special case of this conjecture. Namely, if S contains\ntwo skew lines both defined over K then r(S,K) = 1. One of the difficulties in\nstudying the secant and tangent process on cubic surfaces is that it does not\nlead to an associative binary operation as in the case of elliptic curves. As a\npartial remedy we introduce an abelian group H_S(K) associated to a cubic\nsurface S/K, naturally generated by the K-rational points, which retains much\ninformation about the secant and tangent process. In particular, r(S, K) is\nlarge as soon as the minimal number of generators of H_S(K) is large. In\nsituations where weak approximation holds, H_S has nice local-to-global\nproperties. We use these to construct a family of smooth cubic surfaces over\nthe rationals such that r(S,K) is unbounded in this family.

For the two\nchannel system, when an external drive is applied only to the top or primary\nchannel, we find a transition from locked flow where particles in both channels\nmove together to decoupled flow where the particles in the secondary or\nundriven channel move at a slower velocity than the particles in the primary or\ndriven channel. Pronounced commensurability effects in the decoupling\ntransition occur when the ratio of the number of particles in the top and\nbottom channels is varied, and the coupling of the two channels is enhanced\nwhen this ratio is an integer or a rational fraction. Near the commensurate\nfillings, we find additional features in the velocity-force curves caused by\nthe slipping of individual vacancies or incommensurations in the secondary\nchannels. For three coupled channels, when only the top channel is driven we\nfind a remarkably rich variety of distinct dynamic phases, including multiple\ndecoupling and recoupling transitions. These transitions produce pronounced\nsignatures in the velocity response of each channel. We also find regimes where\na negative drag effect can be induced in one of the non-driven channels. The\nparticles in this channel move in the opposite direction from the particles in\nthe driven channel due to the mixing of the two different periodic frequencies\nproduced by the discrete motion of the particles in the two other channels. In\nthe two channel system, we also demonstrate a ratchet effect for the particles\nin the secondary channel when an asymmetric drive is applied to the primary\nchannel. This ratchet effect is similar to that observed in superconducting\nvortex systems when there is a coupling between two different species of\nvortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 21:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2011 22:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This event, occurring in an equatorial coronal hole on 2007 February\n9, was observed by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope in the Ca II H line in\nunprecedented detail. The predecessor of the jet is a bundle of fine material\nthreads that extend above the chromosphere and appear to rotate about the\nbundle axis at ~50 km/s (period <200 s). These rotations or transverse\noscillations propagate upward at velocities up to 786 km/s. The bundle first\nslowly and then rapidly swings up, with the transition occurring at the onset\nof an A4.9 flare. A loop expands simultaneously in these two phases (velocity:\n16-135 km/s). Near the peak of the flare, the loop appears to rupture;\nsimultaneous upward ejecta and mass downflows faster than free-fall appear in\none of the loop legs. The material bundle then swings back in a whiplike manner\nand develops into a collimated jet, which is orientated along the inferred open\nfield lines with transverse oscillations continuing at slower rates. Some\nmaterial falls back along smooth streamlines, showing no more oscillations. At\nlow altitudes, the streamlines bifurcate at presumably a magnetic null point\nand bypass an inferred dome, depicting an inverted-Y geometry. These\nstreamlines closely match in space the late Ca II H loop and X-ray flare loop.\nThese observations are consistent with the model that flux emergence in an\nopen-field region leads to magnetic reconnection, forming a jet and fan-spine\ntopology. We propose that the material bundle and collimated jet represent the\nouter spine in quasi-static and eruptive stages, respectively, and the growing\nloop is a 2D projection of the 3D fan surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 00:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The accurate calculation of gamma-index\nrequires an exhaustive search of the closest Euclidean distance in the\nhigh-resolution dose-distance space. This is a computational intensive task\nwhen dealing with 3D dose distributions. In this work, we combine a geometric\nmethod with a radial pre-sorting technique , and implement them on computer\ngraphics processing units (GPUs). The developed GPU-based gamma-index\ncomputational tool is evaluated on eight pairs of IMRT dose distributions. The\nGPU implementation achieved 20x~30x speedup factor compared to CPU\nimplementation and gamma-index calculations can be finished within a few\nseconds for all 3D testing cases. We further investigated the effect of various\nfactors on both CPU and GPU computation time. The strategy of pre-sorting\nvoxels based on their dose difference values speed up the GPU calculation by\nabout 2-4 times. For n-dimensional dose distributions, gamma-index calculation\ntime on CPU is proportional to the summation of gamma^n over all voxels, while\nthat on GPU is effected by gamma^n distributions and is approximately\nproportional to the gamma^n summation over all voxels. We found increasing dose\ndistributions resolution leads to quadratic increase of computation time on\nCPU, while less-than-quadratic increase on GPU. The values of dose difference\n(DD) and distance-to-agreement (DTA) criteria also have their impact on\ngamma-index calculation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 00:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The randomness is McFadden-type, which permits an explicit\nresolution of the equilibrium preference probabilities. The purpose of this\nnote is to prove uniqueness of the resulting equilibrium marriage distribution,\nand find a representation of it in closed form. This allows us to derive smooth\ndependence of this distribution on exogenous preference and population\nparameters, and establish sign, symmetry, and size of the various substitution\neffects, facilitating comparative statics. For example, we show that an\nincrease in the population of men of any given type in this model leads to an\nincrease in single men of each type, and a decrease in single women of each\ntype. We show that an increase in the number of men of a given type increases\nthe equilibrium transfer paid by such men to their spouses, and also increases\nthe percentage of men of that type who choose to remain unmarried. The\nverification of such properties helps to substantiate the validity of the\nmodel. Moreover, we make unexpected predictions which could be tested: the\npercentage change of type $i$ unmarrieds with respect to fluctuations in the\ntotal number of type $j$ men or women turns out to form a symmetric\npositive-definite matrix $r_{ij}=r_{ji}$ in this model, and thus to satisfy\nbounds like $|r_{ij}| \\le (r_{ii}r_{jj})^{1/2}$.

In this paper, we propose a novel model, named log-sum\nheuristic recovery (LHR), to learn the essential low-rank structure from\ncorrupted data. Different from traditional approaches, which directly utilize\n$\\ell_1$ norm to measure the sparseness, LHR introduces a more reasonable\nlog-sum measurement to enhance the sparsity in both the intrinsic low-rank\nstructure and in the sparse corruptions. Although the proposed LHR optimization\nis no longer convex, it still can be effectively solved by a\nmajorization-minimization (MM) type algorithm, with which the non-convex\nobjective function is iteratively replaced by its convex surrogate and LHR\nfinally falls into the general framework of reweighed approaches. We prove that\nthe MM-type algorithm can converge to a stationary point after successive\niteration. We test the performance of our proposed model by applying it to\nsolve two typical problems: robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and\nlow-rank representation (LRR).\n  For RPCA, we compare LHR with the benchmark Principal Component Pursuit (PCP)\nmethod from both the perspectives of simulations and practical applications.\nFor LRR, we apply LHR to compute the low-rank representation matrix for motion\nsegmentation and stock clustering.

It is a novel\ninterpretation of strategies and decisions in quantum domain. In the earlier\nwork on quantum games considerable attention was given to the resolution of\ndilemmas present in corresponding classical games. Two separate quantum schemes\nwere presented by Eisert et al. and Marinatto and Weber to resolve dilemmas in\nPrisoners' Dilemma and Battle of Sexes games respectively. However for the\nlatter scheme it was argued that dilemma was not resolved. We have modified the\nquantization scheme of Marinatto and Weber to resolve the dilemma. We have\ndeveloped a generalized quantization scheme for two person non-zero sum games\nwhich reduces to the existing schemes under certain conditions. Applications of\nthis generalized quantization scheme to quantum information theory are studied.\nMeasurement being ubiquitous in quantum mechanics can not be ignored in quantum\ngames. With the help of generalized quantization scheme we have analyzed the\neffects of measurement on quantum games. Qubits are the important elements for\nplaying quantum games and are generally prone to decoherence due to their\ninteractions with environment. An analysis of quantum games in presence of\nquantum correlated noise is performed in the context of generalized\nquantization scheme. Quantum key distribution is one of the key issues of\nquantum information theory for the purpose of secure communication. Using\nmathematical framework of generalized quantization scheme we have proposed a\nprotocol for quantum key distribution and a technique for quantum state\ntomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 07:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}

To date, most experimental studies of\noptomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical\nsubsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental\ndemonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the\nmechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also\nmodified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong\nnonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and\nparametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and\nproposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to\nmodern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the\nforefront of experimental study during the last two decades. In a similar\nfashion, here we use the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of\nlight via engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our results demonstrate EIT\nand tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal device,\nfabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon (Si).

The\nplayers' incentives to use higher demands are stimulated by non-decreasing and\nconcave utility functions. The payoff for a player is defined as the difference\nbetween the utility of the demand and the associated cost on the used\nresources. Although this class of non-cooperative games captures many elements\nof real-world applications, it has not been studied in this generality, to our\nknowledge, in the past. We study the fundamental problem of the existence of\npure Nash equilibria (PNE for short) in congestion games with variable demands.\nWe call a set of cost functions C consistent if every congestion game with\nvariable demands and cost functions in C possesses a PNE.

New deep z'-J data\nshow a clear narrow red sequence that is co-centered with, and similarly\nconcentrated on, the extended X-ray emission of the cluster of galaxies\nJKCS041. The JKCS041 red sequence is 0.32+/-0.06 mag redder in z'-J than the\nred sequence of the zspec=1.62 IRC0218A cluster, putting JKCS041 at z>>1.62 and\nruling out z<~1.49 the latter claimed by a recent paper. The color difference\nof the two red sequences gives a red-sequence-based redshift of z=2.20+/-0.11\nfor JKCS041, where the uncertainty accounts for uncertainties in stellar\nsynthesis population models, in photometric calibration, and in the red\nsequence color of both JKCS041 and IRC0218A clusters. We do not observe any\nsign of truncation of the red sequence for both clusters down to J=23 mag\n(1.0e+11 solar masses), which suggests that it is already in place in clusters\nrich and massive enough to heat and retain hot gas at these high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 09:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The comparison\nof the diffuse signals from different systems may inform us about the key\nparameters in CR acceleration and transport. We aim to determine and compare\nthe properties of the CR-induced gamma-ray emission of several Local Group\ngalaxies. We use 2 years of nearly continuous sky-survey observations obtained\nwith the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to\nsearch for gamma-ray emission from M31 and M33. We compare the results with\nthose for the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Milky\nWay, and the starburst galaxies M82 and NGC253. We detect a gamma-ray signal at\n5sigma significance in the energy range 200 MeV-20 GeV that is consistent with\noriginating from M31. The integral photon flux above 100MeV amounts to 9.1 +/-\n1.9 (stat) +/- 1.0 (sys) x10e-9 ph/cm2/s. We find no evidence for emission from\nM33 and derive an upper limit on the photon flux >100MeV of 5.1 x10e-9 ph/cm2/s\n(2sigma). Comparing these results to the properties of other Local Group\ngalaxies, we find indications for a correlation between star formation rate and\ngamma-ray luminosity that also holds for the starburst galaxies. The gamma-ray\nluminosity of M31 is about half that of the Milky Way, which implies that the\nratio between the average CR densities in M31 and the Milky Way amounts to 0.35\n+/- 0.25. The observed correlation between gamma-ray luminosity and star\nformation rate suggests that the flux of M33 is not far below the current upper\nlimit from the LAT observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 09:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}

Our aim is to derive physical and\nchemical conditions for each family taking into account all observed lines from\nall isotopologues of each species. We have modeled the lines of the detected\nmolecules using a radiative transfer code, which permit us to choose between\nLVG and LTE approximations depending on the physical conditions of the gas. We\nhave used appropriate collisional rates for the LVG calculations. For the v=1\nstate of SiO we have detected the J=2-1 line and, for the first time in this\nsource, emission in the J=4-3 transition, both of them showing strong masering\neffect. For SiO v=0, we have detected 28SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO; in addition, we\nhave mapped the J = 5-4 SiO line. For SiS, we have detected the main species,\n29SiS, and SiS v=1. Unlikely other species detected in Orion KL (IRc2), the\nemission peak of SiS appears at a velocity of ~15.5 km s-1; a study of the 5-4\nSiO line around IRc2 shows this feature as an extended component that probably\narises from the interaction of the outflow with the ambient cloud.

The results of our chemical models show that while it\nis possible to reproduce SiO in the gas phase (as well as on the grains), SiS\nis a product of surface reactions, most likely involving direct reactions of S\nwith Si.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 10:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Several algorithms have been proposed to utilize the quantum\nnature of physical states and solve important problems. For example, Shor's\nquantum algorithm is extremely important in the field of cryptography since it\nfactors large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm.\nAnother celebrated example is the Grovers quantum algorithm. These algorithms\ncan only be implemented on a quantum computer which operates on quantum bits\n(qubits).

Thermal and K{\\alpha} imaging showed reduced\nemission size, increased peak emission and increased total emission at delays\nof 4 - 6 ps, an intensity ratio of 10 : 1 (second:first) and a total energy of\n186 J. In comparison to a single, high contrast shot, the inferred fast\nelectron divergence is reduced by 2.7 times, while the fast electron current\ndensity is increased by a factor of 1.8. The enhancements are reproduced with\nmodelling and are shown to be due to the self-generation of magnetic fields.\nSuch a scheme could be of considerable benefit to fast ignition inertial\nfusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 15:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 09:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

To find signs of newly formed dust, we\nanalyze all available mid-infrared (MIR) archival data from the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. We re-reduce and analyze data from IRAC, MIPS and IRS instruments\nobtained between +98 and +1381 days after explosion, generating light curves\nand spectra for each epoch. Observed spectral energy distributions are fitted\nwith both analytic and numerical models, using the radiative-transfer code\nMOCASSIN for the latter ones.

In\nthe optical, a ~0.8% polarization is also detected at a 2-sigma level, which\nexceeds the interstellar polarization in that direction. Our analysis shows\nthat the freshly-formed dust around SN 2004dj can be modeled assuming a nearly\nspherical shell containing amorphous carbon grains, cooling from ~700 K to ~400\nK between +267 and +1246 days. Persistent excess flux has been found above 10\num, which is explained by a cold (~115 K) dust component. If this cold dust is\nof circumstellar origin, it is likely to be condensed in a cool, dense shell\nbetween the forward and reverse shocks.
