We compute the thermodynamic\nvariables using both statistical mechanics as well as by solving the\nhydrodynamical equations for the system. When the box is far away from the\nhorizon, the entropy of the gas depends on the volume of the box except for\nsmall corrections due to background geometry. As the box is moved closer to the\nhorizon with one (leading) edge of the box at about Planck length (L_p) away\nfrom the horizon, the entropy shows an area dependence rather than a volume\ndependence. More precisely, it depends on a small volume A*L_p/2 of the box,\nupto an order O(L_p/K)^2 where A is the transverse area of the box and K is the\n(proper) longitudinal size of the box related to the distance between leading\nand trailing edge in the vertical direction (i.e in the direction of the\ngravitational field). Thus the contribution to the entropy comes from only a\nfraction O(L_p/K) of the matter degrees of freedom and the rest are suppressed\nwhen the box approaches the horizon. Near the horizon all the thermodynamical\nquantities behave as though the box of gas has a volume A*L_p/2 and is kept in\na Minkowski spacetime.

The\nthree-dimensional aspect of the problem arises from the Stokes parameters Q, U,\nand V, which completely describe the polarization of electromagnetic radiation\nand conceptually define the orientation of a polarization vector in the\nPoincar'e sphere. The statistical aspect of the problem arises from the random\nfluctuations in the source-intrinsic polarization and the instrumental noise. A\nsimple model for the polarization of pulsar radio emission has been used to\nderive the three-dimensional statistics of radio polarimetry. The model is\nbased upon the proposition that the observed polarization is due to the\nincoherent superposition of two, highly polarized, orthogonal modes. The\ndirectional statistics derived from the model follow the Bingham-Mardia and\nFisher family of distributions. The model assumptions are supported by the\nqualitative agreement between the statistics derived from it and those measured\nwith polarization observations of the individual pulses from pulsars. The\northogonal modes are thought to be the natural modes of radio wave propagation\nin the pulsar magnetosphere. The intensities of the modes become statistically\nindependent when generalized Faraday rotation (GFR) in the magnetosphere causes\nthe difference in their phases to be large. A stochastic version of GFR occurs\nwhen fluctuations in the phase difference are also large, and may be\nresponsible for the more complicated polarization patterns observed in pulsar\nradio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2010 21:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The distribution has to be measured\nrelative to the momentum q transferred from the projectile to the target atom.\nThe situation is similar, but not identical to the photoionization studies,\nwhere the matrix elements of continuous spectrum atomic quadrupole transitions\ncan be determined by measuring the so-called non-dipole angular anisotropy\nparameters of photoelectrons.
