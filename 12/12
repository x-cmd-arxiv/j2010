This has\nprevented us to accurately measure the metallicity of dust-obscured galaxies,\nand accordingly to understand the chemical evolution of dusty populations, such\nas ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Here we propose diagnostics of the gas\nmetallicity based on infrared fine structure emission lines, which are nearly\nunaffected by dust extinction even the most obscured systems. Specifically, we\nfocus on fine-structure lines arising mostly from HII regions, not in\nphoto-dissociation regions, to minimize the dependence and uncertainties of the\nmetallicity diagnostics from various physical parameters. Based on\nphotoionization models, we show that the emission-line flux ratio of\n([OIII]51.80+[OIII]88.33)/[NIII]57.21 is an excellent tracer of the gas\nmetallicity. The individual line ratios [OIII]51.80/[NIII]57.21 or\n[OIII]88.33/[NIII]57.21 can also be used as diagnostics of the metallicity, but\nthey suffer a stronger dependence on the gas density. The line ratios\n[OIII]88.33/[OIII]51.80 and [NII]121.7/[NIII]57.21 can be used to measure and,\ntherefore, account for the dependences on the of the gas density and ionization\nparameter, respectively. We show that these diagnostic fine-structure lines are\ndetectable with Herschel in luminous infrared galaxies out z=0.4. Metallicity\nmeasurements with these fine-structure lines will be feasible at relatively\nhigh redshift (z=1 or more) with SPICA, the future infrared space observatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 16:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A long standing question is whether the tenuous collisionless\nshocks, driven inside a relativistic flow, are efficient enough to explain the\namount of energy observed as compared with the expected kinetic power of the\noutflow. In this work we study the dynamic efficiency of conversion of\nkinetic-to- thermal/magnetic energy of internal shocks in relativistic\nmagnetized outflows. We find that the collision between shells with a non-zero\nrelative velocity can yield either two oppositely moving shocks (in the frame\nwhere the contact surface is at rest), or a reverse shock and a forward\nrarefaction. For moderately magnetized shocks (magnetization {\\sigma} ~ 0.1),\nthe dynamic efficiency in a single two-shell interaction can be as large as\n40%. Hence, the dynamic efficiency of moderately magnetized shocks is larger\nthan in the corresponding unmagnetized two-shell interaction. We find that the\nefficiency is only weakly dependent on the Lorentz factor of the shells and,\nthus internal shocks in the magnetized flow of blazars and gamma-ray bursts are\napproximately equally efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 17:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

These spaces include the quasiconformal\nTeichm\\\"uller space, the length spectrum Teichm\\\"uller space, the\nFenchel-Nielsen Teichm\\\"uller space, and there are others. In general, these\nspaces are set-theoretically different. An important question is therefore to\nunderstand relations between these spaces. Each of these spaces is equipped\nwith its own metric, and under some hypotheses, there are inclusions between\nthese spaces. In this paper, we obtain local metric comparison results on these\ninclusions, namely, we show that the inclusions are locally bi-Lipschitz under\ncertain hypotheses. To obtain these results, we use some hyperbolic geometry\nestimates that give new results also for surfaces of finite type. We recall\nthat in the case of a surface of finite type, all these Teichm\\\"uller spaces\ncoincide setwise. In the case of a surface of finite type with no boundary\ncomponents (and possibly with punctures), we show that the restriction of the\nidentity map to any thick part of Teichm\\\"uller space is globally bi-Lipschitz\nwith respect to the length spectrum metric and the classical Teichm\\\"uller\nmetric on the domain and on the range respectively.

We show that the restriction of the identity\nmap restricted to any \"relative thick\" part of Teichm\\\"uller space is globally\nbi-Lipschitz, with respect to any of the three metrics: the length spectrum\nmetric, the Teichm\\\"uller metric and the arc metric on the domain and on the\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 19:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

One of the main difficulties in\nnumerically solving this system is the severe time-step restriction that arises\nfrom parts of the PDF associated with moderate-to-large velocities. The\ndominant approach in the plasma physics community for removing these time-step\nrestrictions is the so-called particle-in-cell (PIC) method, which discretizes\nthe distribution function into a set of macro-particles, while the electric\nfield is represented on a mesh. Several alternatives to this approach exist,\nincluding fully Lagrangian, fully Eulerian, and so-called semi-Lagrangian\nmethods. The focus of this work is the semi-Lagrangian approach, which begins\nwith a grid-based Eulerian representation of both the PDF and the electric\nfield, then evolves the PDF via Lagrangian dynamics, and finally projects this\nevolved field back onto the original Eulerian mesh. In particular, we develop\nin this work a method that discretizes the 1+1 Vlasov-Poisson system via a\nhigh-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method in phase space, and an operator\nsplit, semi-Lagrangian method in time. Second-order accuracy in time is\nrelatively easy to achieve via Strang operator splitting. With additional work,\nusing higher-order splitting and a higher-order method of characteristics, we\nalso demonstrate how to push this scheme to fourth-order accuracy in time. We\nshow how to resolve all of the Lagrangian dynamics in such a way that mass is\nexactly conserved, positivity is maintained, and high-order accuracy is\nachieved. The Poisson equation is solved to high-order via the smallest stencil\nlocal discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) approach.

The introduction of broadband wireless mobile\nad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased\ncomputational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be\ncreated, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time\nmultimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly\nchallenging task since these applications have strict quality -of-service (QoS)\nrequirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional IP-based best\neffort service will not be able to meet these stringent requirements. The\ntime-varying nature of wireless channels and resource constrained wireless\ndevices make the problem even more difficult. To improve perceived media\nquality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can be addressed in\ndifferent layers, including application layer, transport layer and link layer.\nCross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this adaptation. In\ncross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless medium and the\nQoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that the rate,\npower, and coding at the physical layer can adapted to meet the requirements of\nthe applications given the current channel and network conditions. A number of\npropositions for cross-layer designs exist in the literature.

Generally the users require only certain aggregate\nfunctions of this distributed data. Computation of this aggregate data under\nthe end-to-end information flow paradigm by communicating all the relevant data\nto a central collector node is a highly inefficient solution for this purpose.\nAn alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however,\nraises questions such as: what is the optimal way to compute an aggregate\nfunction from a set of statistically correlated values stored in different\nnodes; what is the security of such aggregation as the results sent by a\ncompromised or faulty node in the network can adversely affect the accuracy of\nthe computed result. In this paper, we have presented an energy-efficient\naggregation algorithm for WSNs that is secure and robust against malicious\ninsider attack by any compromised or faulty node in the network. In contrast to\nthe traditional snapshot aggregation approach in WSNs, a node in the proposed\nalgorithm instead of unicasting its sensed information to its parent node,\nbroadcasts its estimate to all its neighbors. This makes the system more\nfault-tolerant and increase the information availability in the network. The\nsimulations conducted on the proposed algorithm have produced results that\ndemonstrate its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 10:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Nevertheless, recent\nwork has shown that a quadrature-entangled light source can reap a substantial\nperformance advantage over all classical-state sources of the same average\ntransmitter power in scenarios whose loss and noise makes them entanglement\nbreaking, standoff target-detection being an example. In this paper, we make a\nfirst step in extending this quantum illumination paradigm to the optical\nimaging domain, viz., to obtain better spatial resolution for standoff optical\nsensing. Our canonical imaging scenario---restricted, for simplicity, to one\ntransverse dimension---is taken to be that of resolving one versus two\nclosely-spaced in-phase specular point targets. We show that an entangled-state\ntransmitter, which uses continuous-wave-pumped spontaneous parametric\ndownconversion (SPDC), achieves an error-probability exponent that exceeds that\nof all classical-state transmitters of the same average power. Using these\nerror-exponent results, we find the ultimate spatial-resolution limits for\ncoherent-state and SPDC imaging systems that use their respective\nquantum-optimal receivers, thus quantifying the latter's spatial-resolution\nadvantage over the former. We also propose a structured optical receiver that\nis ideally capable of harnessing 3 dB (of the full 6 dB) gain in the\nerror-probability exponent achievable by the SPDC transmitter and its\nquantum-optimal receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 15:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Here we report\nthe result of core-level (CL) trPES on 1T-TaS2, realized by developing a\nhigh-intensity 60 eV laser obtained by high-order harmonic (HH) generation.\nTa4f CL-trPES offers the transient amplitude of the charge-density-wave (CDW),\nvia the site-selective and real-time observation of Ta electrons. The present\nresult indicates an ultrafast photoinduced melting and recovery of CDW\namplitude, followed by a peculiar long-life oscillation (i.e. collective\namplitudon excitation) accompanying the transfer of 0.01 electrons among\nadjacent Ta atoms. CL-trPES offers a broad range of opportunities for\ninvestigating the ultrafast atom-specific electron dynamics in photo-related\nphenomena of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 15:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Recently, ubiquitous jets (for example, chromospheric anemone jets,\npenumbral microjets, umbral light bridge jets) have been observed by Solar\nOptical Telescope on board the satellite Hinode. These tiny and frequently\noccurring jets are considered to be a possible evidence of small-scale\nubiquitous reconnection in the solar atmosphere. However, the details of three\ndimensional magnetic configuration are still not very clear. Here we propose a\nnew model based on three dimensional simulations of magnetic reconnection using\na typical current sheet magnetic configuration with a strong guide field. The\nmost interesting feature is that the jets produced by the reconnection\neventually move along the guide field lines. This model provides a fresh\nunderstanding of newly discovered ubiquitous jets and moreover a new\nobservational basis for the theory of astrophysical magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 15:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-20"}
