Since these lines\nhave the same lower levels, inhomogeneous absorption models could be used to\nextract the average true HeI* column density; the log of that number was 14.9.\nThe total hydrogen column density was obtained using Cloudy models. A range of\nionization parameters and densities were allowed, with the lower limit on the\nionization parameter of log U=-1.4 determined by the requirement that there be\nsufficient HeI*, and the upper limit on the density of log n=8 determined by\nthe lack of Balmer absorption.

Tree-level exchange of TeV scale particles in a generic\nlittle Higgs model produce higher dimensional operators that make contributions\nto electroweak observables that are typically too large. To avoid this problem\na discrete symmetry dubbed T-parity can be introduced to forbid the dangerous\ncouplings. However, it was realized that in simple group models such as the\nlittlest Higgs model, the implementation of T-parity in a UV completion could\npresent some challenges. The situation is analogous to the one in QCD where the\npion can easily be defined as being odd under a new $Z_2$ symmetry in the\nchiral Lagrangian, but this $Z_2$ is not a symmetry of the quark Lagrangian. In\nthis paper we examine the possibility of implementing a T-parity in the low\nenergy $SU(6)/Sp(6)$ model that might be easier to realize in the UV. In our\nmodel, the T-parity acts on the low energy non-linear sigma model field in way\nwhich is different to what was originally proposed for the Littlest Higgs, and\nlead to a different low energy theory. In particular, the Higgs sector of this\nmodel is a inert two Higgs doublets model with an approximate custodial\nsymmetry. We examine the contributions of the various sectors of the model to\nelectroweak precision data, and to the dark matter abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 17:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2011 21:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

If d is fixed,\nthen the WL-algorithm runs in polynomial time.

Then we attack the Orbit Problem by constructing certain\napproximate categories C_d(V), d=1,2,3,... whose objects include the elements\nof V. We show that v_1 and v_2 are not in the same orbit by showing that they\nare not isomorphic in the category C_d(V) for some d. For every d this gives us\nan algorithm for isomorphism testing.

Recently an inequality on the entanglement\nentropy of radiation was derived, which showed that such is not the case; one\nneeds {\\it order unity} corrections to low energy modes at the horizon to\nresolve the problem. In this paper we illustrate this inequality by a simple\nmodel where the state of the created Hawking pair at each stage is slightly\nmodified by the state of the previous pair. The model can be mapped onto the\n1-dimensional Ising chain and solved explicitly. In agreement with the general\ninequality we find that very little of the entanglement is removed by the\nencoded correlations. We then use the general inequality to argue that the\nblack hole puzzles split into two problems: the `information paradox' and the\n`infall problem'. The former addresses the detailed state of low energy modes\nat the horizon and asks if these can be modified by order unity, while the\nlatter asks for a coarse grained effective description of the infall of heavy\nobservers into the degrees of freedom of the hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 20:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 18:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 16:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

I argue that, in the\npresence of \\emph{uniform} real and pseudo-magnetic fields, the valley\ndegeneracy from the higher Landau levels can be removed. A pseudo-magnetic\nfield may arise from bulging or stretching of the graphene flake. This may lead\nto observation of plateaus in the Hall conductivity at quantized values $f\ne^2/h$, with $f=\\pm 3, \\pm 5$ etc, which have not been observed in measurement\nof Hall conductivity. However, in a collection of noninteracting Dirac fermions\nliving in the honeycomb lattice subject to real and pseudo field, the zeroth\nLandau level still enjoys the valley and the spin degeneracy. Upon including\nthe Zeeman coupling, the spin degeneracy is removed from all the Landau levels.\nThe effects of short ranged electron-electron interactions are also considered,\nparticularly, the onsite Hubbard repulsion (U) and the nearest-neighbor Coulomb\nrepulsion (V). Within the framework of the extended Hubbard model with only\nthose two components of finite ranged Coulomb repulsion, it is shown that\ninfinitesimally weak interactions can place the system in a gapped insulating\nphase by developing a \\emph{ferrimegnatic} order, if $U>>V$.

Scaling behavior of interaction induced gap at\n$f=1$ in presence of finite pseudo flux is also addressed.

This\ncloses an open problem first raised by Shi [FOCS'02].\n  Our approach is based on two ideas: (i) on the one hand we generalize the\nknown additive and multiplicative adversary methods to the case of quantum\nstate generation, (ii) on the other hand we show how the symmetries of the\nunderlying problem can be leveraged for the design of optimal adversary\nmatrices and dramatically simplify the computation of adversary bounds. Taken\ntogether, these two ideas give the new result for {\\sc Index Erasure} by using\nthe representation theory of the symmetric group. Also, the method can lead to\nlower bounds even for small success probability, contrary to the standard\nadversary method. Furthermore, we answer an open question due to \\v{S}palek\n[CCC'08] by showing that the multiplicative version of the adversary method is\nstronger than the additive one for any problem.

This cool circum-galactic component drops precipitously once the\ngalaxies cross the critical mass to form stable shocks, Mvir = Msh ~ 10^12\nMsun. Before reaching Msh, the galaxies experience cold mode accretion (T<10^5\nK) and show moderately high covering fractions in accreted gas: f_c ~ 30-50%\nfor R<50 co-moving kpc and N_HI>10^16 cm^-2. These values are considerably\nlower than observed covering fractions, suggesting that outflowing gas (not\nincluded here) is important in simulating galaxies with realistic gaseous\nhalos. Within ~500 Myr of crossing the Msh threshold, each galaxy transitions\nto hot mode gas accretion, and f_c drops to ~5%. The sharp transition in\ncovering fraction is primarily a function of halo mass, not redshift.

Inviscid, and viscous Newtonian jets have\nbeen studied in great detail; buckling instability in viscous jets leads to\nregular periodic coiling of the jet that exhibits a non-trivial frequency\ndependence with the height of the fall. Very few experimental or theoretical\nstudies exist for continuous viscoelastic jets beyond the onset of the first\ninstability. Here, we present a systematic study of the effects of\nviscoelasticity on the dynamics of free surface continuous jets of surfactant\nsolutions that form worm-like micelles. We observe complex nonlinear\nspatio-temporal dynamics of the jet and uncover a transition from periodic to\ndoubly-periodic or quasi-periodic to a multi-frequency, possibly chaotic\ndynamics. Beyond this regime, the jet dynamics smoothly crosses over to exhibit\nthe \"leaping shampoo effect\" or the Kaye effect. This enables us to view\nseemingly disparate jetting dynamics as one coherent picture of successive\ninstabilities and transitions between them. We identify the relevant scaling\nvariables as the dimensionless height, flow rate, and the elasto-gravity number\nand present a regime map of the dynamics of the jet in terms of these\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 22:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

Precession of the\napses and nodes are detected in both systems (2001 SN263 inner body:\nd{\\varpi}/dt ~1.1 deg/day, 1994 CC inner body: d{\\varpi}/dt ~ -0.2 deg/day),\nwhich is in agreement with analytical predictions of the secular evolution due\nto mutually interacting orbits and primary oblateness. Nonzero mutual\ninclinations between the orbital planes of the satellites provide the best fits\nto the data in both systems (2001 SN263: ~14 degrees, 1994 CC: ~16 degrees).\nOur best-fit orbits are consistent with nearly circular motion, except for 1994\nCC's outer satellite which has an eccentric orbit of e ~ 0.19. We examine\nseveral processes that can generate the observed eccentricity and inclinations,\nincluding the Kozai and evection resonances, past mean-motion resonance\ncrossings, and close encounters with terrestrial planets. In particular, we\nfind that close planetary encounters can easily excite the eccentricities and\nmutual inclinations of the satellites' orbits to the currently observed values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 01:19:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 23:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Neural responses often use spike\npatterns to represent sensory information. The what is hypothesized to be\nencoded in the identity of the elicited patterns (the pattern categories), and\nthe when, in the time positions of patterns (the pattern timing). However, this\nstandard view is oversimplified. In the real world, the what and the when might\nnot be separable concepts, for instance, if they are correlated in the\nstimulus. In addition, neuronal dynamics can condition the pattern timing to be\ncorrelated with the pattern categories. Hence, timing and categories of\npatterns may not constitute independent channels of information. In this paper,\nwe assess the role of spike patterns in the neural code, irrespective of the\nnature of the patterns. We first define information-theoretical quantities that\nallow us to quantify the information encoded by different aspects of the neural\nresponse. We also introduce the notion of synergy/redundancy between time\npositions and categories of patterns. We subsequently establish the relation\nbetween the what and the when in the stimulus with the timing and the\ncategories of patterns. To that aim, we quantify the mutual information between\ndifferent aspects of the stimulus and different aspects of the response. This\nformal framework allows us to determine the precise conditions under which the\nstandard view holds, as well as the departures from this simple case. Finally,\nwe study the capability of different response aspects to represent the what and\nthe when in the neural response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 01:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

For this we have used the\npan-spectral fitting tools developed in a series of papers by Dopita and his\nco-workers. We show that the standard Lee and Draine `astronomical silicate'\nmodel cannot provide a good fit to the silicate absorption features as observed\nin the heavily dust-extinguished ($A_{\\rm V} \\sim 50$mag.) starbursts. We have\nderived an empirical fit to the `starburst silicate' absorption in these\nobjects. This absorption curve is consistent with the silicate grains being\nsystematically larger in starburst environments than in the local Galactic\ninterstellar medium. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the SED fitting to each\nof the fitted parameters, and derive these parameters for those galaxies which\ndo not have an embedded AGN. This technique is simple and provides reasonably\nrobust and uniform parameters for the starburst, especially as far as the star\nformation rate, population of old stars, compactness of the starburst region\nand total foreground extinction are concerned. However, the chemical abundances\nand the optical extinction cannot be reliably determined by this analysis, and\noptical SEDs will also be required to provide a complete characterization of\nthe starburst region and of the surrounding galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 03:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

By applying this\nconstruction to the unitriangular group, we are able to derive by hand an\nexplicit description of a family of characters of $\\UT_n(q)$ taking values in\narbitrarily large cyclotomic fields. In particular, we prove that if $r$ is a\npositive integer power of $p$ and $n>6r$, then $\\UT_n(q)$ has an irreducible\ncharacter of degree $q^{5r^2-2r}$ which takes values outside $\\QQ(\\zeta_{pr})$.\nBy the same techniques, we are also able to construct explicit Kirillov\nfunctions which fail to be characters of $\\UT_n(q)$ when $n>12$ and $q$ is\narbitrary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 07:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

It has been found that massive stars can\nproduce p-nuclei through photodisintegration of pre-existing intermediate and\nheavy nuclei. This so-called gamma-process requires sufficiently high\ntemperatures and occurs in pre-explosive or explosive O/Ne burning, depending\non the mass of the star. Although the gamma-process has been successful in\nproducing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110\nand 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable\nnuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the\nreaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.\nDeficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process\ntemperatures have been found for nuclei at stability. On the other hand, the\ngamma-process conditions (temperature profiles, entropy of the O shell, seed\ncomposition) also sensitively depend on details of the stellar structure and\nevolution, as well as on the initial metallicity. Nevertheless, especially the\ndeficient low-mass p-nuclei may call for an additional production process or\nsite, such as production in (subChandrasekhar) type Ia supernovae. Also the\n(im)possibility of a synthesis in the rp- and nu-p-processes is discussed. Were\nthis the case, the production of p-nuclei would be realized as a superposition\nof several different processes, not necessarily in the same site.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 09:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

It can be sliced in graphs, where a change from one graph to another\ncan be organized by a sequence of local transitions, which are described in a\nlist of F. Quinn [Q1]. The decomposition of that 2-complex into graphs has to\nbe translated into an algebraic context (for example Topological Quantum field\ntheory (TQFT)) to construct suitable potential invariants under 3-deformations.\nThese invariants are accessible for computation by using a supercomputer and\nthe results may yield a counterexample to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture. To\nachieve invariance under 3-deformations, there are obvious topological\nrelations among the local transitions, for example to deform a bubble out of a\nrectangle. In this paper our main result is that we contribute a complete list\nof such topological relations in a totally geometric fashion. One outcome of\nour considerations is that the corresponding list of F. Quinn [Q1] is extended\nby an additional relation which takes care of locally changing a slicing. We do\nnot know so far whether this relation is a consequence of the remaining ones.\nBut it may be crucial for further work to focus on such subtleties, as\nalgebraic \"simplifications\", where this question is bypassed, so far have been\nunable to distinguish between simple homotopy and 3-deformations at all. In our\nintroduction we summarize some known results on the situation when passing to\nAlgebra; and in {\\S} 8 we calculate an example of an algebraic TQFT in order to\ndemonstrate that our additional relation holds. All considerations are carried\nout for 2-complexes with two generators and two defining relators. But the\nresults also hold in the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 10:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

We first investigate a mass limited sample and we find\nthat, above a fixed mass limit, the ellipticity distribution of early-types\nnoticeably evolves with redshift. In the local Universe there are\nproportionally more galaxies with higher ellipticity, hence flatter, than in\ndistant clusters. This evolution is due partly to the change of the mass\ndistribution and mainly to the change of the morphological mix with z (among\nthe early types, the fraction of ellipticals goes from ~70% at high to ~40% at\nlow-z). Analyzing separately the ellipticity distribution of the different\nmorphological types, we find no evolution both for ellipticals and S0s.\nHowever, for ellipticals a change with redshift in the median value of the\ndistributions is detected. This is due to a larger population of very round\n(e<0.05) elliptical galaxies at low-z. To compare our finding to previous\nstudies, we also assemble a magnitude-\"delimited\" sample that consists of\nearly-type galaxies on the red sequence with -19.3>M_B+1.208z>-21. Analyzing\nthis sample, we do not recover exactly the same results of the mass-limited\nsample. Hence the selection criteria are crucial to characterize the galaxy\nproperties: the choice of the magnitude-delimited sample implies the loss of\nmany less massive galaxies and so it biases the final results. Moreover,\nalthough we are adopting the same selection criteria, our results in the\nmagnitude-delimited sample are also not in agreement with those of Holden et\nal.(2009).

The disentangled spectra of a binary star system are\nvery well suited to spectroscopic analysis but for one problem: the absolute\nspectral line depths are unknown because this information is not contained in\nthe original spectra (unless there is one taken in eclipse) without making\nassumptions about the spectral characteristics of the component stars.

The method is demonstrated on synthetic spectra and then applied to the\neclipsing binary V615 Per, a member of the young open cluster NGC 869 (h\nPersei). The method works well for disentangled spectra with signal-to-noise\nratios of 100 or more. For V615 Per we find a normal He abundance but an Mg\nabundance, which indicates bulk metallicity, a factor of two lower than typical\nfor nearby OB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 12:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The nature of the HDF5 format further provides the\nability to custom design a data encapsulation format, specifying hierarchies,\ncontent and attributes. The LOFAR project has designed several data formats\nthat will accommodate and house all LOFAR data products, the primary styles and\nkinds of which are presented in this paper.

The investigations are\nperformed in the range of small bias currents and magnetic fields, where the\nFFO radiates a quasi-chaotic signal with extremely large radiation linewidth,\nand the displaced linear slope (DLS) is observed at the current-voltage\ncharacteristic. By direct numerical simulation of the sine-Gordon equation it\nis demonstrated that for large lengths of the Josephson junction or in the case\nof finite matching of the FFO with external waveguide system, the DLS with\nextremely large linewidth is transformed into Fiske steps with very narrow\nlinewidth. While there is the common belief that the chaotic regime of the FFO\nis due to excitation of the internal oscillation modes in the \"soft\" fluxon\nchain, it is demonstrated that this regime is inspired by multiple reflections\nof the traveling waves from junction ends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 15:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

Having in mind the proposed ESA space mission \\emph{Euclid} as a\nspecific example, we combine the spatial distribution of spectroscopically\nselected galaxies with that of weak lensing selected clusters. We use the\nphysically motivated halo model in order to represent the correlation function\nof arbitrary tracers of the Large Scale Structure in the Universe. As naively\nexpected, we find that galaxies are much more effective in jointly constrain\nthe level of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_\\mathrm{NL}$ and the amplitude of\nthe matter power spectrum $\\sigma_8$ than clusters of galaxies, due to the much\nlower abundance of the latter that is not adequately compensated by the larger\neffect on the power spectrum. Nevertheless, combination of the galaxy power\nspectrum with the cluster-galaxy cross spectrum can decrease the error on the\ndetermination of $f_\\mathrm{NL}$ by up to a factor of $\\sim 2$. This decrement\nis particularly evident for the less studied non-Gaussian bispectrum shapes,\nthe so-called enfolded and the orthogonal ones. Setting constraints on these\nmodels can shed new light on various aspects of the physics of the early\nUniverse, and it is hence of extreme importance. By combining the power spectra\nof clusters and galaxies with the cluster-galaxy cross spectrum we find\nconstraints on primordial non-Gaussianity of the order $\\Delta f_\\mathrm{NL}\n\\sim $ a few, competitive and possibly superior to future CMB experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 15:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 14:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Many of\nthe research efforts in this context have focused on introducing new\nrepresentation methods for dimensionality reduction or novel similarity\nmeasures for the underlying data. In the vast majority of cases, each\nindividual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and,\naside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative\nexperimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects\nof these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of\nthe proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to\nprovide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimental\nstudy re-implementing eight different time series representations and nine\nsimilarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on\nthirty-eight time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains.\nIn this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present\nour comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. In\naddition to providing a unified validation of some of the existing\nachievements, our experiments also indicate that, in some cases, certain claims\nin the literature may be unduly optimistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 19:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
