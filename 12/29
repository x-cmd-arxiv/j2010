An interferometer using N independent\nparticles to measure a parameter X can achieve at best the \"standard quantum\nlimit\" (SQL) of sensitivity {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-1/2}. The same interferometer\nusing N entangled particles can achieve in principle the \"Heisenberg limit\"\n{\\delta}X \\propto N^{-1}, using exotic states. Recent theoretical work argues\nthat interactions among particles may be a valuable resource for quantum\nmetrology, allowing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, a\nk-particle interaction will produce sensitivity {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-k} with\nappropriate entangled states and {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-(k-1/2)} even without\nentanglement. Here we demonstrate this \"super-Heisenberg\" scaling in a\nnonlinear, non-destructive measurement of the magnetisation of an atomic\nensemble. We use fast optical nonlinearities to generate a pairwise\nphoton-photon interaction (k = 2) while preserving quantum-noise-limited\nperformance, to produce {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-3/2}. We observe super-Heisenberg\nscaling over two orders of magnitude in N, limited at large N by higher-order\nnonlinear effects, in good agreement with theory. For a measurement of limited\nduration, super-Heisenberg scaling allows the nonlinear measurement to overtake\nin sensitivity a comparable linear measurement with the same number of photons.\nIn other scenarios, however, higher-order nonlinearities prevent this crossover\nfrom occurring, reflecting the subtle relationship of scaling to sensitivity in\nnonlinear systems. This work shows that inter-particle interactions can improve\nsensitivity in a quantum-limited measurement, and introduces a fundamentally\nnew resource for quantum metrology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2010 16:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

We focus on systems with F-type\nmain-sequence stars and find that the recently discovered system CoRoT-11 is\npresently the best suited for such a kind of investigation. A classic constant\ntidal lag model is applied to reproduce the evolution of the system from a\nplausible nearly synchronous state on the ZAMS to the present state, thus\nputting constraints on the average modified tidal quality factor <Q'_s> of its\nF6V star. Initial conditions with the stellar rotation period longer than the\norbital period of the planet can be excluded on the basis of the presently\nobserved state in which the star spins faster than the planet orbit. It is\nfound that <Q'_s> is approximately between 4.0E+06 and 2.0E+07 if the system\nstarted its evolution on the ZAMS close to synchronization with an uncertainty\nrelated to the constant tidal lag hypothesis and the estimated stellar magnetic\nbraking within a factor of about 5-6. Moreover, we discuss how the present\nvalue of Q'_s can be measured by a timing of the mid-epoch and duration of the\ntransits as well as of the planetary eclipses to be observed in the infrared\nwith an accuracy of about 0.5-1 s over a time baseline of about 25 yr.

One of\nthe causes of this large uncertainty is that the size distribution of emitted\ndust aerosols is poorly understood. The present study shows that regional and\nglobal circulation models (GCMs) overestimate the emitted fraction of clay\naerosols (< 2 {\\mu}m diameter) by a factor of ~2 - 8 relative to measurements.\nThis discrepancy is resolved by deriving a simple theoretical expression of the\nemitted dust size distribution that is in excellent agreement with\nmeasurements. This expression is based on the physics of the scale-invariant\nfragmentation of brittle materials, which is shown to be applicable to dust\nemission. Because clay aerosols produce a strong radiative cooling, the\noverestimation of the clay fraction causes GCMs to also overestimate the\nradiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust. On local and regional\nscales, this affects the magnitude and possibly the sign of the dust radiative\nforcing, with implications for numerical weather forecasting and regional\nclimate predictions in dusty regions. On a global scale, the dust cycle in most\nGCMs is tuned to match radiative measurements, such that the overestimation of\nthe radiative cooling of a given quantity of emitted dust has likely caused\nGCMs to underestimate the global dust emission rate. This implies that the\ndeposition flux of dust and its fertilizing effects on ecosystems may be\nsubstantially larger than thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2010 19:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 00:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-20"}

For the same\nlevel of redundancy, erasure coding based approaches are known to require less\ndata storage space than replication methods.\n  To maintain the same level of redundancy when one storage node fails, erasure\ncoded data can be restored onto some other storage node by having this node\ndownload respective pieces from other live storage nodes. Previous works showed\nthat the benefits in using erasure coding for robust storage over replication\nare made unappealing by the complication in regenerating lost data. More recent\nwork has, however, shown that the bandwidth for erasure coded data can be\nfurther reduced by proposing Regenerating Coding, making erasure codes again\ndesirable for robust data storage.\n  But none of these works on regenerating coding consider how these codes will\nperform for data regeneration in wireless sensor networks. We therefore propose\nan analytical model to quantify the network lifetime gains of regenerating\ncoding over classical schemes.

Particularly, with numerical simulations, we compare\nthe Gaussian filter with the so called MRLens treatment based on the\nmodification of the Maximum Entropy Method. For a pure noise field without\nlensing signals, a Gaussian smoothing results a residual noise field that is\napproximately Gaussian in statistics if a large enough number of galaxies are\nincluded in the smoothing window. On the other hand, the noise field after the\nMRLens treatment is significantly non-Gaussian, resulting complications in\ncharacterizing the noise effects. Considering weak-lensing cluster detections,\nalthough the MRLens treatment effectively deletes false peaks arising from\nnoise, it removes the real peaks heavily due to its inability to distinguish\nreal signals with relatively low amplitudes from noise in its restoration\nprocess. The higher the noise level is, the larger the removal effects are for\nthe real peaks. For a survey with a source density n_g~30 arcmin^(2), the\nnumber of peaks found in an area of 3x3 sq.deg after MRLens filtering is only\n~50 for the detection threshold kappa=0.02, while the number of halos with\nM>5x10^{13} M_{\\odot} and with redshift z<=2 in the same area is expected to be\n~530. For the Gaussian smoothing treatment, the number of detections is ~260,\nmuch larger than that of the MRLens. The Gaussianity of the noise statistics in\nthe Gaussian smoothing case adds further advantages for this method to\ncircumvent the problem of the relatively low efficiency in weak-lensing cluster\ndetections. Therefore, in studies aiming to construct large cluster samples\nfrom weak-lensing surveys, the Gaussian smoothing method performs significantly\nbetter than the MRLens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 09:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

These proteins are characterized by an\nensemble of high-flexible interchangeable conformations and therefore they can\ninteract with many targets without requiring pre-existing stereo-chemical\ncomplementarity. It has been suggested that intrinsically disordered proteins\nare frequent in proteomes and disorder is widespread also in structured\nproteins. However, several studies raise some doubt about these views. It this\npaper we estimate the frequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in several\nliving organisms by using the ratio S between the likelihood, for a protein\nsequence, of being composed mainly by order-promoting or disorder-promoting\nresidues. We scan several proteomes from Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. We find\nthe following figures: 1.63% for Archaea, 3.91% for Bacteria, 16.35% for\nEukarya. The frequencies we found can be considered an upper bound to the real\nfrequency of intrinsically disordered proteins in proteomes. Our estimates are\nlower than those previously reported in several studies. A scanning of proteins\nin the Protein Data Bank (PDB) searching for segments of non-observed residues\nreveals that segments of non-observed residues longer than 30 amino acids, are\nrare. Our observations support the idea that the spread of the unfoldome has\nbeen often overestimated. If we exclude some exceptions, the structure-function\nparadigm is generally valid and pre-existing stereo-chemical complementarity\namong structures remains an important requisite for interactions between\nbiological macromolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 11:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

Here we analyze the profile in\nthe deep core of the NaI doublet line from HST and high-resolution ground-based\nspectra to further constrain the vertical structure of the HD209458b\natmosphere. With a wavelength-dependent cross section that spans more than 5\norders of magnitude, we use the absorption signature of the NaI doublet as an\natmospheric probe.

With a\nrealistic transport model of the collision, which generates flow and\nnon-Gaussian sources, we find that these formulae approximately reflect the\nanisotropy of the freezeout distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 14:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-22"}

The\nannotations are based on a set of general rules that make the frequency of\nannotations not dramatically high.

This means that we can get an annotated version\nof any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize.

If the hidden sector breaks\nsupersymmetry independently, its fields cannot be stabilized during\ncosmological evolution of the inflaton. We show that both the subsequent\ndynamical mixing between sectors as well as the lightest mass of the hidden\nsector are set by the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector. The\ntrue cosmological eta-parameter arises from a linear combination of the\nlightest mode of the hidden sector with the inflaton. Generically, either the\ntrue eta deviates considerably from the na\\\"ive eta implied by the inflaton\nsector alone, or one has to consider a multifield model. Only if the lightest\nmass in the hidden sector is much larger than the inflaton mass and if the\ninflaton mass is much larger than the scale of hidden sector supersymmetry\nbreaking, is the effect of the hidden sector on the slow-roll dynamics of the\ninflaton negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 15:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 09:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

The physical reason behind this exact result can be traced back to the\nobservation of Arnowitt et al. that the gravitational mass of a neutral point\nparticle is zero: $m=0$ (PRL, 4, 375, 1960). And since, a dust is a mere\ncollection of {\\em neutral point particles, unlike a continuous hydrodynamic\nfluid}, its density $\\rho = m n=0$. It is nonetheless found that for $k=-1$, a\nhomogeneous dust can collapse and expand special relativistically in the\nfashion of a Milne universe. Thus, in reality, general relativistic homogeneous\ndust collapse does not lead to the formation of any black hole in conformity of\nmany previous studies (Logunov, Mestverishvili, Kiselev, Phys.Part.Nucl. 37,\n317, 2006; Kisevev, Logunov & Mestvirishvili, Theor. Math. Phys., 164, 972,\n2010; Mitra, J. Math. Phys. 50, 042502, 2009; Suggett, J. Phys. A, 12, 375\n1979).\n  Interestingly, this result is in agreement with the intuition of Oppenheimer\n& Snyder (Phys. Rev. 56, p.456, 1939) too:\n  \"Physically such a singularity would mean that the expressions used for the\nenergy-momentum tensor does not take into account some essential physical fact\nwhich would really smooth the singularity out. Further, a star in its early\nstages of development would not possess a singular density or pressure, it is\nimpossible for a singularity to develop in a finite time.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 07:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-02"}
