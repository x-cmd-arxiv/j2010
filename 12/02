The data of the PHENIX collaboration on\ndilepton production in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV for masses above 1\nGeV are found to be dominated by the contributions of the QGP radiation and the\ncharm meson decays, while the measured spectrum is underestimated in the mass\nrange from 0.2 to 0.6 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 17:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Resonant systems are of\nparticular interest because their dynamical configuration provides constraints\non the unobservable formation and migration phase. In this thesis, formation\nscenarios for the planetary systems HD128311 and HD45364 are presented. N-body\nsimulations of two planets and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of\nproto-planetary discs are used to model the migration phase and the capture\ninto resonance. The results indicate that the proto-planetary disc has a larger\nsurface density than previously thought. Proto-planets are exposed to\nstochastic forces, generated by density fluctuations in the disc. A generic\nmodel of both a single planet, and two planets in resonance, being\nstochastically forced is presented. The system GJ876, for example, is stable\nfor reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces, but systems with lighter\nplanets can get disrupted. Even if they are not disrupted completely,\nstochastic forces create characteristic, observable libration patterns.\nTurbulence plays also an important role during the early phases of the planet\nformation process. Due to the large separation of scales, the gravitational\ncollapse in the core accretion model is very hard to model numerically. A\nscaled method is presented, that allows for the correct treatment of\nself-gravity in a marginally collisional system by taking into account the\nrelevant small scale processes. Interestingly, this system is dynamically very\nsimilar to Saturn's rings. The stochastic migration of small bodies in Saturn's\nrings is also studied.

The\nroughness in the initial times behaves as in the random deposition model, with\nan exponent $\\beta_{1} \\approx 1/2$. At intermediate times, the surface\nroughness depends on the system dimensionality and, finally, at long times, it\nenters into the saturation regime, which is described by the roughness exponent\n$\\alpha$. The scaling exponents of the model are the same as those predicted by\nthe Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation for deposition in one dimension. For the\ndeposition in two dimensions, we show that the interface width in the second\nregime presents an unusual behavior, described by a growing exponent\n$\\beta_{2}$, which depends on the size of the particles added to the substrate.\nIf the linear size of the particle is two, we found that $\\beta_{2}<\\beta_{1}$,\notherwise it is $\\beta_{2}>\\beta_{1}$, for all particles sizes larger than\nthree. While in one dimension the scaling exponents are the same as those\npredicted by the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation, in two dimensions, the growth\nexponents are nonuniversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 18:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-17"}

The\ntheoretically predicted antideuteron flux resulting from secondary interactions\nof primary cosmic rays with the interstellar medium is very low. So far not a\nsingle cosmic antideuteron has been detected by any experiment, but\nwell-motivated theories beyond the standard model of particle physics, e.g.,\nsupersymmetry or universal extra dimensions, contain viable dark matter\ncandidates, which could led to a significant enhancement of the antideuteron\nflux due to self-annihilation of the dark matter particles.This flux\ncontribution is believed to be especially large at small energies, which leads\nto a high discovery potential for GAPS. GAPS is designed to achieve its goals\nvia a series of ultra-long duration balloon flights at high altitude in\nAntarctica, starting in 2014.

We find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuous\nvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.\nWe introduce a parameter, Delta_3D, that measures the central deviation of the\ndeprojected luminosity profiles from the global Sersic fit, showing that this\nparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-15"}

A small neighborhood of the solar nebula is represented by an\norbiting patch of gas at a radius of 3 AU, and includes vertical stratification\nof the gas density. The differential rotation of the nebular gas is replaced by\na shear flow. Turbulence is driven by destabilization of the flow as a result\nof the magnetorotational instability (MRI), whereby magnetic field lines\nanchored to the gas are continuously stretched by the shearing motion. A\npassive contaminant mimics small dust grains that are aerodynamically well\ncoupled to the gas, and chondrules are modeled by Lagrangian particles that\ninteract with the gas through drag. Whenever a chondrule enters a region\npermeated by dust, its radius grows at a rate that depends on the local dust\ndensity and the relative velocity between itself and the dust. The local dust\nabundance decreases accordingly. Different chondrule volume densities lead to\nvarying depletion and rimmed-chondrule size growth times.

Such flows can\ndevelop a special kind of singularities, that could not appear in the Ricci\nflow, namely singularities where the manifold collapses with bounded curvature.\nWe show that this phenomenon cannot occur if we assume a uniform positive lower\nbound on the Yamabe invariant. In particular, for a number of gradient flows in\ndimension four, such a lower bound exists if we assume a bound on the initial\nenergy. This implies that these flows can only develop singularities where the\ncurvature blows up, and that blowing-up sequences converge (up to a\nsubsequence) to a \"singularity model\", namely a complete Bach-flat, scalar-flat\nmanifold. We prove a rigidity result for those model manifolds and show that if\nthe initial energy is smaller than an explicit bound, then no singularity can\noccur. Under those assumptions, the flow exists for all time, and converges up\nto a subsequence to the sphere or the real projective space. This gives an\nalternative proof, under a slightly stronger assumption, of a result from\nChang, Gursky and Yang asserting that integral pinched 4-manifolds with\npositive Yamabe constant are space forms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 22:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-03"}

The\nlatency is controlled by decoupling the routing from the fake traffic schedule.\nWe believe that the proposed source anonymity protection strategy, and the\nquality evaluation framework, are well justified by the abundance of the\napplications that monitor a rare event with known temporal statistics, and\nuniform spatial distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 03:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-03"}

The hard X-ray spectra of\nSeyferts as well as of Galactic stellar-mass black holes (GBHs) are well\nrepresented by thermal Comptonization, but the origin of the seed photons is\nless certain. The MeV tails observed in GBHs provide evidence in favour of\nnon-thermal electron tails and it is possible that such electrons are also\npresent in the X-ray emitting regions of AGNs. Using simulations with the\nkinetic code that self-consistently models electron and photon distributions,\nwe find that the power-law-like X-ray spectra in AGNs can be explained in terms\nof the synchrotron self-Compton radiation of hybrid thermal/non-thermal\nelectrons, similarly to the hard/low state of GBHs. Under a very broad range of\nparameters the model predicts a rather narrow distribution of photon spectral\nslopes consistent with that observed from LINERs and Seyferts at luminosities\nless than 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The entire infrared to X-ray\nspectrum of these objects can be described in terms of our model, suggesting a\ntight correlation between the two energy bands. We show that the recently found\ncorrelation between slope and the Eddington ratio at higher luminosities can be\ndescribed by the increasing fraction of disc photons in the emitting region,\nwhich may be associated with the decreasing inner radius of the optically thick\naccretion disc. The increasing flux of soft photons is also responsible for the\ntransformation of the electron distribution from nearly thermal to almost\ncompletely non-thermal. The softer X-ray spectra observed in narrow-line\nSeyfert galaxies may correspond to non-thermal Comptonization of the disc\nphotons, predicting that no cutoff should be observed up to MeV energies in\nthese sources, similarly to the soft-state GBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 14:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 16:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2011 09:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The formalism is based on the use of the effective action and zeta\nfunction regularization, supports the inclusion of inhomogeneous and\nanisotropic phases. One of the key points of the method is the use of a\nnon-perturbative ansatz for the heat-kernel that returns the effective action\nin partially resummed form, providing a way to go beyond the approximations\nbased on the Ginzburg-Landau expansion for the partition function. The\neffective action for the case of ultra-static Riemannian spacetimes with\ncompact spatial section is discussed in general and a series representation,\nvalid when the chemical potential satisfies a certain constraint, is derived.\nTo see the formalism at work, we consider the case of static Einstein spaces at\nzero chemical potential. Although in this case we expect inhomogeneous phases\nto occur only as meta-stable states, the problem is complex enough and allows\nto illustrate how to implement numerical studies of inhomogeneous phases in\ncurved space. Finally, we extend the formalism to include arbitrary chemical\npotentials and obtain the analytical continuation of the effective action in\ncurved space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 15:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2011 04:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

As local dynamics we employ a map that exhibits a\nperiod-three superstable orbit. The network is characterized by a rewiring\nprobability $p$. We find that collective chaos is inhibited on some ranges of\nvalues of the probability $p$; instead, in these regions the system reaches a\nsynchronized state equal to the period-three orbit of the local dynamics.

The optimizer works by repeatedly\napplying these analyses to infer equivalences between program fragments, thus\nsaturating the intermediate representation with equalities. Once saturated, the\nintermediate representation encodes multiple optimized versions of the input\nprogram. At this point, a profitability heuristic picks the final optimized\nprogram from the various programs represented in the saturated representation.\nOur proposed way of structuring optimizers has a variety of benefits over\nprevious approaches: our approach obviates the need to worry about optimization\nordering, enables the use of a global optimization heuristic that selects among\nfully optimized programs, and can be used to perform translation validation,\neven on compilers other than our own.
