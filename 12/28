We employed the technique\nof difference image analysis to perform precision differential photometry on\nthe time-series images, which enabled us to carry out a census of the\nunder-studied variable star population of the cluster. We show that 20\nsuspected variables in the literature are actually non-variable, and we confirm\nthe variable nature of another 29 variables while refining their ephemerides.\nWe also detect 11 new RR Lyrae variables and 3 new SX Phe variables, bringing\nthe total confirmed variable star count in NGC 6981 to 43.\n  We performed Fourier decomposition of the light curves for a subset of RR\nLyrae stars and used the Fourier parameters to estimate the fundamental\nphysical parameters of the stars using relations available in the literature.\nMean values of these physical parameters have allowed us to estimate the\nphysical parameters of the parent cluster. We derive a metallicity of [Fe/H]_ZW\n= -1.48+-0.03 on the Zinn & West (1984) scale (or [Fe/H]_UVES = -1.38+-0.03 on\nthe new Carretta et al.

This additional boundary condition is different, because of\nthe Coriolis forcing term, than the no heat flux physical boundary condition.\nConsequently, the second order parabolic heat equation is over determined with\ntwo different boundary conditions.

Obtaining new set of photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations, we analysed them together with the older spectroscopic and\nphotometric data to build model of this eclipsing system with respect to\nobserved changes of O-C diagram and light curve. Methods. Reduction of new\nspectra was carried out in the IRAF and SPEFO programs. Radial velocities were\ndetermined manually using SPEFO, by CCF using the Zverko's code and from the\nprogram KOREL. Orbital elements were derived with the FOTEL program and via\ndisentangling with KOREL. The final combined solution was obtained with the\nprograms PHOEBE and FOTEL. Results. Photometry shows small irregularities in\nlight curves as a results of pulsating of one component and spot activity.\nUsing net of KOREL outputs we found the mass ratio q=0.405(3).We confirm the\npresence of stellar matter around the primary.

This approach is based on the notion-strictly hypothetical-that if a\nparticular star could be observed continuously, the instrument would in time\nobserve all portions of the habitable zone so that no planet residing therein\ncould be missed. This strategy could not be implemented in any realistic\nmission scenario. But if an exoplanet's orbit is known from astrometric\nobservation, then it may be possible to plan and schedule a sequence of imaging\nobservations that is the equivalent of continuous observation. A series of\nimages-optimally spaced in time-could be recorded to examine contiguous\nsegments of the orbit. In time, all segments would be examined, leading to the\ninevitable detection of the planet. In this paper, we show how astrometric\norbit information can be used to construct such a sequence.

Maintaining high performance, while\nextending the battery life between charges is an interesting challenge for\nsystem designers. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) allows a processor to\ndynamically change speed and voltage at run time, thereby saving energy by\nspreading run cycles into idle time. Knowing when to use full power and when\nnot, requires the cooperation of the operating system scheduler. Usually,\nhigher processor voltage and frequency leads to higher system throughput while\nenergy reduction can be obtained using lower voltage and frequency. Instead of\nlowering processor voltage and frequency as much as possible, energy efficient\nreal-time scheduling adjusts voltage and frequency according to some\noptimization criteria, such as low energy consumption or high throughput, while\nit meets the timing constraints of the real-time tasks. As the quantity and\nfunctional complexity of battery powered portable devices continues to raise,\nenergy efficient design of such devices has become increasingly important. Many\nreal-time scheduling algorithms have been developed recently to reduce energy\nconsumption in the portable devices that use DVS capable processors. Three\nalgorithms namely Red Tasks Only (RTO), Blue When Possible (BWP) and Red as\nLate as Possible (RLP) are proposed in the literature to schedule the real-time\ntasks in Weakly-hard real-time systems. This paper proposes optimal slack\nmanagement algorithms to make the above existing weakly hard real-time\nscheduling algorithms energy efficient using DVS and DPD techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2010 04:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

On the other hand, the formation of collapsing cores in\nsubcritical clouds is accelerated by supersonic nonlinear flows. Our parameter\nstudy demonstrates that core formation occurs faster as the strength of the\ninitial flow speed in the cloud increases. We found that the core formation\ntime is roughly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the enhanced\ndensity created by the supersonic nonlinear flows.

We developed a new method to derive the\nintrinsic shape of bulges based on photometric data and on the geometrical\nrelationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of bulges and disks.\nThe method is conceived as completely independent of the studied class of\nobjects, and it can be applied whenever a triaxial ellipsoid embedded in an\naxisymmetric component is considered. We found that the intrinsic shape is well\nconstrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. A\nlarge fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (B/A<0.9).\nThis fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or median\nequatorial ellipticity, respectively. Most of them are flattened along their\npolar axis. The distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. This\nbimodality is driven by bulges with Sersic index n>2, or equivalently, by the\nbulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio B/T>0.3. Bulges with n<2 and\nwith B/T<0.3 follow a similar distribution, which is different from that of\nbulges with n>2 and with B/T>0.3. In particular, bulges with n<2 and with\nB/T<0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric)\nbulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, and fewer prolate axisymmetric\n(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect to bulges with n>2 and with\nB/T>0.3, respectively. According to the numerical simulations of bulge\nformation, bulges with n<2, which show a high fraction of oblate axisymmetric\n(or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and have B/T<0.3, could be the result of\ndissipational minor mergers.

Many authors have argued that the\nappearance of various subsets of class I masers may be indicative of specific\nevolutionary stages of star formation or excitation conditions. Until recently,\nhowever, no major interferometer was capable of imaging the important 36 GHz\ntransition. We report on Expanded Very Large Array observations of the 36 GHz\nmethanol masers and Submillimeter Array observations of the 229 GHz methanol\nmasers in DR21(OH), DR21N, and DR21W. The distribution of 36 GHz masers in the\noutflow of DR21(OH) is similar to that of the other class I methanol\ntransitions, with numerous multitransition spatial overlaps. At the site of the\nmain continuum source in DR21(OH), class I masers at 36 and 229 GHz are found\nin virtual overlap with class II 6.7 GHz masers. To the south of the outflow,\nthe 36 GHz masers are scattered over a large region but usually do not appear\ncoincident with 44 GHz masers. In DR21W we detect an \"S-curve\" signature in\nStokes V that implies a large value of the magnetic field strength if\ninterpreted as due to Zeeman splitting, suggesting either that class I masers\nmay exist at higher densities than previously believed or that the direct\nZeeman interpretation of S-curve Stokes V profiles in class I masers may be\nincorrect.
