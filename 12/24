The deep source of this fundamental difficulty\nin non-K\\\"ahler geometry is the {\\it explosion of the area} phenomenon: the\narea of a curve $C_b\\subset X_b$ in a fixed 2-homology class can diverge as\n$b\\to b_0$. This phenomenon occurs frequently in the deformation theory of\nclass VII surfaces. For instance it is well known that any minimal GSS surface\n$X_0$ is a degeneration of a 1-parameter family of simply blown up primary Hopf\nsurfaces $(X_z)_{z\\in D\\setminus\\{0\\}}$, so one obtains non-proper families of\nexceptional divisors $E_z\\subset X_z$ whose area diverge as $z\\to 0$.

We will prove that, under certain technical assumptions, a lift\n$\\widetilde E_z$ of $E_z$ in the universal cover $\\widetilde X_z$ does converge\nto an effective divisor $\\widetilde E_0$ in $\\widetilde X_0$, but this limit\ndivisor is not compact.

This phenomenon - degeneration of a family of compact curves to an\ninfinite union of compact curves - should be called {\\it infinite bubbling}.\n  We believe that such a decomposition result holds for any family of class VII\nsurfaces whose generic fiber is a blown up primary Hopf surface.

After\nintroducing a number of observational constraints from the solar system, from\nobserved protoplanetary disks, and from the extrasolar planets, we simplify the\nproblem by dividing it into a number of discrete stages which are assumed to\noccur in a sequential way. In the first stage - the growth from dust to\nkilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central\nimportance. We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode, as well as a\ngravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust. In the\nnext stage, planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size.\nGravity is now the dominant force. The mass accretion can be strongly\nnon-linear, leading to the detachment of a few big bodies from the remaining\nplanetesimals. In the outer planetary system (outside a few AU), some of these\nbodies can become so massive that they eventually accrete a large gaseous\nenvelope. This is the stage of giant planet formation, as understood within the\ncore accretion-gas capture paradigm. We also discuss the direct gravitational\ncollapse model where giant planets are thought to form directly via a\ngravitational fragmentation of the gas disk. In the inner system, protoplanets\ncollide in the last stage - probably after the dispersal of the gaseous disk -\nin giant impacts until the separations between the remaining terrestrial\nplanets become large enough to allow long term stability.

The models are constructed so as\nto exclude the unphysical occurrence of runaway solutions. By using the\nEfetov-Wegner supersymmetry method in combination with the new technique of\nsuperbosonization, the disordered boson model is cast in the form of a\nsupermatrix field theory.

However, whenever the ion density of the plasma\nbecomes sufficiently low, the Hall effect is likely to become important. The\nrole of the Hall effect has been studied in several astrophysical plasma\nprocesses, such as magnetic reconnection, magnetic dynamo, MHD turbulence or\nMHD instabilities. In particular, the development of small-scale instabilities\nis essential to understand the transport properties in a number of\nastrophysical plasmas. The magneto-rotational instability, which takes place in\ndifferentially rotating accretion disks embedded in relatively weak magnetic\nfields, is just one example. The influence of the large-scale velocity flows on\nsmall-scale instabilities is often approximated by a linear shear flow. In this\npaper we quantitatively study the role of the Hall effect on plasmas embedded\nin large-scale shear flows. More precisely, we show that a new instability\ndevelops as long as the Hall effect is present, which we therefore term as the\nHall magneto-shear instability. As a particular case, we recover the so-called\nmagneto-rotational instability and quantitatively assess the role of the Hall\neffect on its development and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 20:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 22:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-04"}

In recent years, however, the isotopic\ncomposition of lunar samples has been determined to high precision and found to\nbe indistinguishable from the terrestrial mantle despite widespread isotopic\nheterogeneity in the Solar System. In the context of the giant-impact\nhypothesis, this level of isotopic homogeneity can evolve if the proto-lunar\ndisk and post-impact Earth undergo turbulent mixing into a single uniform\nreservoir while the system is extensively molten and partially vaporized. In\nthe absence of liquid-vapor separation, such a model leads to the lunar\ninheritance of the chemical composition of the terrestrial magma ocean. Hence,\nthe turbulent mixing model raises the question of how chemical differences\narose between the silicate Earth and Moon. Here we explore the consequences of\nliquid-vapor separation in one of the settings relevant to the lunar\ncomposition: the silicate vapor atmosphere of the post-giant-impact Earth. We\nuse a model atmosphere to quantify the extent to which rainout can generate\nchemical differences by enriching the upper atmosphere in the vapor, and show\nthat plausible parameters can generate the postulated enhancement in the\nFeO/MgO ratio of the silicate Moon relative to the Earth's mantle. Moreover, we\nshow that liquid-vapor separation also generates measurable mass-dependent\nisotopic offsets between the silicate Earth and Moon and that precise silicon\nisotope measurements can be used to constrain the degree of chemical\nfractionation during this earliest period of lunar history. An approach of this\nkind has the potential to resolve long-standing questions on the lunar chemical\ncomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2010 00:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-27"}

Despite much\nwork in this topic, a universally accepted adiabatic approach of bound-free\ntransitions is lacking. Hence, based on Savichev's modified adiabatic\napproximation [Sov. Phys.

For\ncomplicated materials, different stress concepts are used with ambiguity or\ndifferent understanding. Geometrically, a material element is expressed by a\nclosed region with arbitral shape. The internal region is acted by distance\ndependent force (internal body force), while the surface is acted by surface\nforce. Further more, the element as a whole is in a physical background\n(exterior region) which is determined by the continuum where the element is\nembedded (external body force). Physically, the total energy can be additively\ndecomposed as three parts: internal region energy, surface energy, and the\nbackground energy. However, as forces, they cannot be added directly. After\nformulating the general forms of physical fields, the deformation tensor is\nintroduced to formulate the force variations caused by deformation. As the\nforce variation is expressed by the deformation tensor, the deformation stress\nconcept is well formulated. Furthermore, as a natural result, the additive\ndecomposition gives out the definition of static continuum, which determines\nthe material parameters in constitutive equations. Through using the exterior\ndifferentials, the constitutive equations are formulated in general form.\nThroughout the paper, when it is suitable, the related results are simplified\nto classical results for easier understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2010 08:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-27"}
