Our studies focus on\nRichardson crater (72{\\deg}S, 179{\\deg}E) and cover southern spring and summer\n(LS 175{\\deg} - 17 341{\\deg}). Three units have been identified of these spots:\ndark core, gray ring and bright halo. Each unit show characteristic changes as\nthe season progress. In winter, the whole area is covered by CO2 ice with H2O\nice contamination. Dark spots form during late winter and early spring. During\nspring, the dark spots are located in a 10 cm thick depression compared to the\nsurrounding bright ice-rich layer. They are spectrally characterized by weak\nCO2 ice signatures that probably result from spatial mixing of CO2 ice rich and\nice free regions within pixels, and from mixing of surface signatures due to\naerosols scattering. The bright halo shaped by winds shows stronger CO2\nabsorptions than the average ice covered terrain, which is consistent with a\nformation process involving CO2 re-condensation. According to spectral,\nmorphological and modeling considerations, the gray ring is composed of a thin\nlayer of a few tens of {\\mu}m of water ice. Two sources/processes could\nparticipate to the enrichment of water ice in the gray ring unit: (i) water ice\ncondensation at the surface in early fall (prior to the condensation of a CO2\nrich winter layer) or during winter time (due to cold trapping of the CO2\nlayer); (ii) ejection of dust grains surrounded by water ice by the geyser\nactivity responsible for the dark spot. In any case, water ice remains longer\nin the gray ring unit after the complete sublimation of the CO2. Finally, we\nalso looked for liquid water in the near-IR CRISM spectra using linear unmixing\nmodeling but found no conclusive evidence for it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 16:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The survey fields cover an area of approximately 27 sq.\ndegrees to a flux-density completeness of 1 mJy. Results for some deeper areas,\ncovering approximately 12 sq. degrees, wholly contained within the total areas\nand complete to 0.5 mJy, are also presented. The completeness for both areas is\nestimated to be at least 93 per cent.\n  The source catalogue contains 1897 entries and is available at\nwww.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/10C.

A broken power law is found to provide\na good parameterisation of the differential count between 0.5 mJy and 1 Jy. The\nmeasured count has been compared to that predicted by de Zotti et al.

This matching provides evidence for a shift in the typical\n1.4-to-15.7-GHz spectral index of the 15.7-GHz-selected source population with\ndecreasing flux density towards sub-mJy levels - the spectra tend to become\nless steep.\n  Automated methods for detecting extended sources have been applied to the\ndata; approximately 5 per cent of the sources are found to be extended relative\nto the LA synthesised beam of approximately 30 arcsec.

The overlap\nof these nonlinear secular resonances drive secular chaos in planetary systems.\nWe quantify the resulting dynamics for the first time by calculating the\nlocations and widths of nonlinear secular resonances. When results from both\nanalytical calculations and numerical integrations are displayed together in a\nnewly developed \"map of the mean momenta\" (MMM), the agreement is excellent.\nThis map is particularly revealing for non-coplanar planetary systems and\ndemonstrates graphically that chaos emerges from overlapping secular\nresonances. We then apply this newfound understanding to Mercury. Previous\nnumerical simulations have established that Mercury's orbit is chaotic, and\nthat Mercury might even collide with Venus or the Sun. We show that Mercury's\nchaos is primarily caused by the overlap between resonances that are\ncombinations of four modes, the Jupiter-dominated eccentricity mode, the\nVenus-dominated inclination mode and Mercury's free eccentricity and\ninclination. Numerical integration of the Solar system confirms that a slew of\nthese resonant angles alternately librate and circulate. We are able to\ncalculate the threshold for Mercury to become chaotic: Jupiter and Venus must\nhave eccentricity and inclination of a few percent. Mercury appears to be\nperched on the threshold for chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 18:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The critical exponents at the Wilson-Fisher FP show a\nweak dependence on the resummation parameters. On the contrary, the exponents\nat the spurious FP as well as its very existence are strongly dependent on\nthese parameters. For the cubic model, a new stable FP is found and its\nproperties depend also strongly on the resummation parameters. It appears to be\nspurious, as expected. As for the frustrated models, there are two cases\ndepending on the value of the number of spin components. When N is greater than\na critical value Nc, the stable FP shows common characteristic with the\nWilson-Fisher FP. On the contrary, for N<Nc, the results obtained at the stable\nFP are similar to those obtained at the spurious FPs of the O(N) and cubic\nmodels.

Such a high T_R\nvalue typically leads to an overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe,\nwhich will cause conflicts, mainly with BBN constraints. Asaka and Yanagida\n(AY) have proposed that these two issues can be reconciled in the context of\nthe Peccei-Quinn augmented MSSM (PQMSSM) if one adopts a mass hierarchy\nm(sparticle)>m(gravitino)>m(axino), with m(axino) keV. We calculate the relic\nabundance of mixed axion/axino dark matter in the AY scenario, and investigate\nunder what conditions a value of T_R sufficient for thermal leptogenesis can be\ngenerated. A high value of PQ breaking scale f_a is needed to suppress\noverproduction of axinos, while a small vacuum misalignment angle \\theta_i is\nneeded to suppress overproduction of axions. The large value of f_a results in\nlate decaying neutralinos. To avoid BBN constraints, the AY scenario requires a\nlow thermal abundance of neutralinos and high values of neutralino mass. We\ninclude entropy production from late decaying saxions, and find the saxion\nneeds to be typically at least several times heavier than the gravitino. A\nviable AY scenario suggests that LHC should discover a spectrum of SUSY\nparticles consistent with weak scale supergravity; that the apparent neutralino\nabundance is low; that a possible axion detection signal (probably with m_axion\nin the sub-micro-eV range) should occur, but no direct or indirect signals for\nWIMP dark matter should be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 22:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 17:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The particles in one channel are\ndriven and experience a drag from the undriven particles in the second channel.\nIn the absence of pinning, for a finite driving force there is no pinned phase;\ninstead, there are two dynamical regimes of completely coupled or locked flow\nand partially coupled flow. When pinning is added to one or both channels, we\nfind that a remarkably rich variety of dynamical phases and drag effects arise\nthat can be clearly identified by features in the velocity force curves. The\npresence of quenched disorder in only the undriven channel can induce a pinned\nphase in both channels. Above the depinning transition, the drag on the driven\nparticles decreases with increasing pinning strength, and for high enough\npinning strength, the particles in the undriven channel reach a reentrant\npinned phase which produces a complete decoupling of the channels. We map out\nthe dynamic phase diagrams as a function of pinning strength and the density of\npinning in each channel.

This enables us to probe mesoscale structure in\nstratified thin disks. We evolve the model at several resolutions, sizes, and\ninitial magnetic field strengths. Consistent with earlier work, we find that\nthe saturated, turbulent state consists of a weakly magnetized disk midplane\ncoupled to a strongly magnetized corona, with a transition at |z| ~ 2H.

Nevertheless angular momentum\ntransport through the corona is small. A study of magnetic field loops in the\ncorona reveals few open field lines and predominantly toroidal loops with a\ncharacteristic distance between footpoints that is ~ H.

Thus we can\napply tools from dynamical systems theory such as continuation of periodic\norbits and computation of Lyapunov exponents. We propose a model ODE for the\nquasi-period doubling cascade which, in a limit of a perturbation parameter to\nzero, avoids resonance related problems. The cascade we observe in the\nsimulations is then compared to the perturbed case, in which resonances\ncomplicate the bifurcation scenario. In particular, we compare the frequency\nspectrum and the Lyapunov exponents. The perturbed model ODE is shown to be in\ngood agreement with the simulations of weak turbulence. The scaling of the\nobserved cascade is shown to resemble the unperturbed case, which is directly\nrelated to the well known doubling cascade of periodic orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 02:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-20"}

In recent years, quite a few methods have been\nproposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the\ndynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological\nproperties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal\nvisibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different\nHurst index $H\\in(0,1)$. Special attention has been paid to the impact of Hurst\nindex on the topological properties. It is found that the clustering\ncoefficient $C$ decreases when $H$ increases. We also found that the mean\nlength $L$ of the shortest paths increases exponentially with $H$ for fixed\nlength $N$ of the original time series. In addition, $L$ increases linearly\nwith respect to $N$ when $H$ is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when $H$\nis close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with $H$,\nthe motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different $H$. Adopting the\nnode-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found\nto be fractals and the fractal dimension $d_B$ decreases with $H$. Furthermore,\nthe Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree\ncorrelations increase with the degree, which indicate that the horizontal\nvisibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of $H$, the Pearson\ncoefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is\naround $H=0.6$. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the\nhorizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is\ndifferent from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 11:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 07:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 09:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2011 05:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Screening of variables, as\nintroduced in \\cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to\nremove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining\nall the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of\nthousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a\nmanageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to\nidentify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs\nto perform fast screening of relevant variables. As our main theoretical\ncontribution, we prove that, asymptotically, S-OMP is guaranteed to reduce an\nultra-high number of variables to below the sample size without losing true\nrelevant variables. We also provide formal evidence that a modified Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently determine the number of\niterations in S-OMP. We further provide empirical evidence on the benefit of\nvariable selection using multiple regression outputs jointly, as opposed to\nperforming variable selection for each output separately. The finite sample\nperformance of S-OMP is demonstrated on extensive simulation studies, and on a\ngenetic association mapping problem. $Keywords$ Adaptive Lasso; Greedy forward\nregression; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Multi-output regression; Multi-task\nlearning; Simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit; Sure screening; Variable\nselection\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 14:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-20"}

Absorption line indices are widely used to determine the stellar\npopulation parameters such as age and metallicity of galaxies, but it is not\neasy to obtain the line indices of some distant galaxies that have colours\navailable. Aims. This paper investigates the correlations between absorption\nline indices and colours. Methods. A few statistical fitting methods are mainly\nused, via both the observational data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and a widely\nused theoretical stellar population model. Results. Some correlations between\nwidely used absorption line indices and ugriz colours are found from both\nobservational data of early-type galaxies and a theoretical simple stellar\npopulation model. In particular, good correlations between colours and widely\nused absorption line indices such as Dn(4000), HgammaA, HgammaF, HdeltaA, Mg1,\nMg2, and Mgb, are shown in this paper. Conclusions. Some important absorption\nline indices of early-type galaxies can be estimated from their colours using\ncorrelations between absorption line indices and colours. For example,\nage-sensitive absorption line indices can be estimated from (u-r) or (g-r)\ncolours and metallicity-sensitive ones from (u - z) or (g - z). This is useful\nfor studying the stellar populations of distant galaxies, especially for\nstatistical investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 15:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 08:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This method\nis based on optimal control and renders an exact solution for the 3D microwave\nfield that triggers the switching of a nanomagnet with a given anisotropy and\nin an oblique static field. Applying this technique to the particular case of\nuniaxial anisotropy, we show that the optimal microwave field, that achieves\nswitching with minimal absorbed energy, is modulated both in frequency and in\nmagnitude. Its role is to drive the magnetization from the metastable\nequilibrium position towards the saddle point and then damping induces the\nrelaxation to the stable equilibrium position. For the pumping to be efficient,\nthe microwave field frequency must match at the early stage of the switching\nprocess the proper precession frequency of the magnetization, which depends on\nthe magnitude and direction of the static field. We investigate the effect of\nthe static field (in amplitude and direction) and of damping on the\ncharacteristics of the microwave field. We have computed the switching curves\nin the presence of the optimal microwave field. The results are in qualitative\nagreement with micro-SQUID experiments on isolated nanoclusters. The strong\ndependence of the microwave field and that of the switching curve on the\ndamping parameter may be useful in probing damping in various nanoclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 15:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
