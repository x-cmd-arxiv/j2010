We test how well the resulting inhomogeneity effects\nbeyond spherical jellium are reproduced by several approximations of density\nfunctional theory (DFT). Four rungs of Perdew's ladder of DFT functionals,\nnamely local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA), meta-GGA and orbital-dependent hybrid functionals are compared against\nour quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) benchmarks. We identify several distinct\ntransitions in the ground state of the system as the electronic occupation\nchanges between delocalized and localized states. We examine the parameter\nspace of realistic densities ($1 \\le r_s\\le 5$) and moderate depths of the\nGaussian impurity ($Z<7$). The selected 18 electron system (with closed-shell\nground state) presents $1d \\to 2s$ transitions while the 30 electron system\n(with open-shell ground state) exhibits $1f \\to 2p$ transitions. For the former\nsystem, the accuracy for the transitions is clearly improving with increasing\nsophistication of functionals with meta-GGA and hybrid functionals having only\nsmall deviations from QMC. However, for the latter system, we find much larger\ndifferences for the underlying transitions between our pool of DFT functionals\nand QMC. We attribute this failure to treatment of the exact exchange within\nthese functionals. Additionally, we amplify the inhomogeneity effects by\ncreating the system with spherical shell which leads to even larger errors in\nDFT approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 16:06:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2011 18:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Due to the highly\nnon-convex nature, optimal power control is known to be difficult to achieve if\na system utility is to be maximized. To date, there does not yet exist a\ndistributed power control algorithm that maximizes any form of system utility,\ndespite the importance of distributed implementation for the wireless\ninfrastructureless networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks. This paper\nfills this gap by developing a Gibbs Sampling based Asynchronous distributed\npower control algorithm (referred to as GLAD). The proposed algorithm quickly\nconverges to the global optimal solution regardless of the concavity,\ncontinuity, differentiability and monotonicity of the utility function. Same as\nother existing distributed power control algorithms, GLAD requires extensive\nmessage passing among all users in the network, which leads to high signaling\noverhead and high processing complexity. To address this issue, this paper\nfurther proposes a variant of the GLAD algorithm, referred to as I-GLAD, where\nthe prefix \"I\" stands for infrequent message passing. The convergence of I-GLAD\ncan be proved regardless of the reduction in the message passing rate. To\nfurther reduce the processing complexity at each transmitter, we develop an\nenhanced version of I-GLAD, referred to as NI-GLAD, where only the control\nmessages from the neighboring links are processed. Our simulation results show\nthat I-GLAD approximately converges to the global optimal solution regardless\nof the type of the system utility function. Meanwhile, the optimality of the\nsolution obtained by NI-GLAD depends on the selection of the neighborhood size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2010 05:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2011 15:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-04"}

Each of the $n$ two-qubit controlled-phase\n(CP) gates involved in this multiqubit phase gate has a shared control qubit\nbut a {\\it different} target qubit. In this propose, the two lowest levels of\neach system represent the two logical states of a qubit while the two\nhigher-energy intermediate levels are used for the gate implementation. The\nmethod presented here operates essentially by creating a single photon through\nthe control qubit, which then induces a phase shift to the state of each target\nqubit. The phase shifts on each target qubit can be adjusted by changing the\nRabi frequencies of the pulses applied to the target qubit systems. The\noperation time for the gate implementation is independent of the number of\nqubits, and neither adjustment of the qubit level spacings nor adjustment of\nthe cavity mode frequency during the gate operation is required by this\nproposal. It is also noted that this approach can be applied to implement\ncertain types of significant multiqubit phase gates, e.g., the multiqubit phase\ngate consisting of $n$ two-qubit CP gates which are key elements in quantum\nFourier transforms.

If this transition occurs in the low-density limit, it can\nbe understood as the deformation of the one-dimensional Wigner crystal to a\nzigzag arrangement of the electrons described by an Ising order parameter. The\ncritical properties are governed by the charge degrees of freedom and the spin\nsector remains essentially decoupled. At large densities, on the other hand,\nthe transition is triggered by the filling of a second one-dimensional subband\nof transverse quantization. Electrons at the bottom of the second subband\ninteract strongly due to the diverging density of states and become\nimpenetrable. We argue that this stabilizes the electron liquid as it\nsuppresses pair-tunneling processes between the subbands that would otherwise\nlead to an instability.

The goal of the present paper is to explore the effectiveness of the\nnearest neighbor statistics (NNST) of the photon distribution for the\ninvestigation of the number counts of the very weak sources. All the sources\ngenerating at least two counts each induce a nonrandom distribution of counts.\nThis distribution is analyzed by means of the NNST.
