There is thus a\npressing need for multi-SNP analysis methods that can reveal system-level\ndifferences in cases and controls. Here, we present a novel multi-SNP GWAS\nanalysis method called Pathways of Distinction Analysis (PoDA). The method uses\nGWAS data and known pathway-gene and gene-SNP associations to identify pathways\nthat permit, ideally, the distinction of cases from controls. The technique is\nbased upon the hypothesis that if a pathway is related to disease risk, cases\nwill appear more similar to other cases than to controls for the SNPs\nassociated with that pathway. By systematically applying the method to all\npathways of potential interest, we can identify those for which the hypothesis\nholds true, i.e., pathways containing SNPs for which the samples exhibit\ngreater within-class similarity than across classes. Importantly, PoDA improves\non existing single-SNP and SNP-set enrichment analyses in that it does not\nrequire the SNPs in a pathway to exhibit independent main effects. This permits\nPoDA to reveal pathways in which epistatic interactions drives risk. In this\npaper, we detail the PoDA method and apply it to two GWA studies: one of breast\ncancer, and the other of liver cancer. The results obtained strongly suggest\nthat there exist pathway-wide genomic differences that contribute to disease\nsusceptibility. PoDA thus provides an analytical tool that is complementary to\nexisting techniques and has the power to enrich our understanding of disease\ngenomics at the systems-level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 16:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 22:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

One\nof the main questions in this area is the parallel repetition question: Is\nthere a way to decrease the maximum winning probability of a game without\nincreasing the number of rounds or the number of players? Classically, efforts\nto resolve this question, open for many years, have culminated in Raz's\ncelebrated parallel repetition theorem on one hand, and in efficient product\ntesters for PCPs on the other.\n  In the case where players share entanglement, the only previously known\nresults are for special cases of games, and are based on techniques that seem\ninherently limited. Here we show for the first time that the maximum success\nprobability of entangled games can be reduced through parallel repetition,\nprovided it was not initially 1. Our proof is inspired by a seminal result of\nFeige and Kilian in the context of classical two-prover one-round interactive\nproofs. One of the main components in our proof is an orthogonalization lemma\nfor operators, which might be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 16:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 17:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

It is well-accepted that the classical nucleation theory (CNT) fails to\nprovide a qualitative picture and gives incorrect quantitative values for such\nquantities as activation free energy barrier and supersaturation dependence of\nnucleation rate, especially at large metastability. In this article, we present\na powerful alternative formalism to treat nucleation at large supersaturation.\nThis formalism goes over to the classical picture at small supersaturation\nwhere CNT is expected to be valid. The new theory is based on an extended set\nof order parameters in terms of k-th largest liquid-like clusters where k=1 is\nthe largest cluster in the system, k=2 is the second largest cluster and so on.\nWe derive an analytic expression for the free energy of formation of the k-th\nlargest cluster which shows that at large metastability the barrier of growth\nfor the few largest liquid-like clusters disappear, the nucleation becomes\ncollective and the approach to the critical size occurs by barrierless\ndiffusion in the cluster size space. The expression for the rate of barrier\ncrossing predicts a weaker supersaturation dependence than that of CNT at large\nmetastability. Such a cross-over behavior has indeed been observed in recent\nexperiments but eluded an explanation till now. In order to understand the\nlarge numerical difference between simulation predictions and experimental\nresults, we carried out a study of the dependence on the range of\nintermolecular interaction of both the surface tension of an equilibrium planar\ngas-liquid interface and the free energy barrier of nucleation. Both are found\nto depend significantly on the range of interaction for a Lennard-Jones\npotential, both in two and three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 17:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-22"}

A comparison with previous abundance determinations for red\ngiants provided remarkable agreement and allowed us to identify the\nsub-populations to which our targets belong. We found that three targets belong\nto a low-metallicity population at [Fe/H]~-2.0 dex, [alpha/Fe]~+0.4 dex and\n[s/Fe]~0 dex.

Two of the remaining\ntargets belong to the dominant metal-poor population (MP) at [Fe/H]~-1.7 dex,\nand the last one to the metal-intermediate (MInt) one at [Fe/H]~-1.2 dex. The\nexistence of the newly defined VMP population could help to understand some\npuzzling results based on low-resolution spectroscopy (Sollima et al.,\nVillanova et al.) in their age differences determinations, because the\nmetallicity resolution of these studies was probably not enough to detect the\nVMP population.

We estimate IMC to persist up to 10^{19} G at low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 20:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 16:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 16:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-18"}

Thus whereas all three models require that\nthere is a relativistically broadened Fe line, the strength and inner radius of\nsuch a line is dependent upon the specific model, {thus making premature\nline-based estimates of the black hole spin in the Cyg X-1 system. We look at\nthe relativistic line in detail, accounting for the narrow Fe emission and\nionized absorption detected by HETG.

The survey reached a 3 sigma limiting\nmagnitude of 23.6 (NB209) which corresponds to a 3 sigma limiting line flux of\n2.5 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 over a 56 arcmnin^2 contiguous area (excluding a\nshallower area). From this survey, we have identified 11 H-alpha emitters and\none AGN at z=2.2 on the basis of narrow-band excesses and photometric\nredshifts. We obtained spectra for seven new objects among them, including one\nAGN, and an emission line above 3 sigma is detected from all of them. We have\nestimated star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses (M_star) for individual\ngalaxies. The average SFR and M_star is 27.8M_solar yr^-1 and 4.0 x\n10^10M_solar, respectivly. Their specific star formation rates are inversely\ncorrelated with their stellar masses. Fitting to a Schechter function yields\nthe H-alpha luminosity function with log L = 42.82, log phi = -2.78 and alpha =\n-1.37. The average star formation rate density in the survey volume is\nestimated to be 0.31M_solar yr^-1Mpc^-3 according to the Kennicutt relation\nbetween H-alpha luminosity and star formation rate. We compare our H-alpha\nemitters at z=2.2 in GOODS-N with narrow-band line emitters in other field and\nclusters to see their time evolution and environmental dependence. We find that\nthe star formation activity is reduced rapidly from z=2.5 to z=0.8 in the\ncluster environment, while it is only moderately changed in the field\nenvironment. This result suggests that the timescale of galaxy formation is\ndifferent among different environments, and the star forming activities in high\ndensity regions eventually overtake those in lower density regions as a\nconsequence of \"galaxy formation bias\" at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 02:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A weak point of the described method is the local set of SN\n(at z < 0.2), as these SN are essential to anchor the Hubble diagram. These SN\nare drawn from a volume much smaller than the Hubble volume and could be\naffected by local structure. Without the assumption of homogeneity, there is no\nevidence for acceleration, as the effects of acceleration are degenerate with\nthe effects of inhomogeneities.

We\ntherefore investigate an alternative mode in which messages are stored by relay\nvehicles traveling in the opposite direction, and forwarded to vehicles in the\noriginal direction at a later time. The wireless communication consists of two\n`transversal' message hops across driving directions. Since direct connectivity\nfor transversal hops and a successful message transmission to vehicles in the\ndestination region is only a matter of time, the quality of this IVC strategy\ncan be described in terms of the distribution function for the total\ntransmission time. Assuming a Poissonian distance distribution between equipped\nvehicles, we derive analytical probability distributions for message\ntransmission times and related propagation speeds for a deterministic and a\nstochastic model of the maximum range of direct communication. By means of\nintegrated microscopic simulations of communication and bi-directional traffic\nflows, we validated the theoretical expectation for multi-lane roadways. We\nfound little deviation of the analytical result for multi-lane scenarios, but\nsignificant deviations for a single-lane. This can be explained by vehicle\nplatooning. We demonstrate the efficiency of the transverse hopping mechanism\nfor a congestion-warning application in a microscopic traffic simulation\nscenario.

We explore and exploit this\ninterplay to obtain new insight into nucleation phenomena. Just like its\ndependence on supersaturation (S), the free energy barrier of nucleation is\nfound to depend strongly on the range of the interaction potential. Actually,\nthe entire free energy surface, F(n), where n is the size of the liquid-like\ncluster, shows this dependence. The evidences and the reasons for this strong\ndependence are as follows. (i) The surface tension increases dramatically on\nincreasing the range of interaction potential. In three dimensional\nLennard-Jones system, the value of the surface tension increases from 0.494 for\na cut-off of 2.5 {\\sigma} to 1.09 when the full range of the potential is\ninvolved. In two dimensional LJ system, the value of the line tension increases\nfrom 0.05 to 0.18, under the same variation of the potential range. (ii) The\ndensity of the gas phase at coexistence decreases while that of the liquid\nphase increases substantially on increasing the range of the interaction\npotential. (iii) As a result of the above, at a given supersaturation S, the\nsize of the critical nucleus and the free energy barrier both increase with\nincrease in the range of interaction potential. (iv) Surprisingly, however, we\nfind that the functional form predicted by the classical nucleation theory\n(CNT) for the dependence of the free energy barrier on the size of the nucleus\nto remain valid except at the largest value of S studied. (v) The agreement\nbetween CNT prediction and simulated values of the barrier is supersaturation\ndependent and worsens with increase in the range of interaction potential, and\nincreases above 10 kBT at the largest supersaturation that could be studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 09:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

Let each point of some initial stationary point\nprocess in $\\R^n$ give rise to one daughter point, the location of which is\nobtained by adding a random vector to the coordinates of the mother point, with\nall displacement vectors independently and identically distributed for all\npoints. The decoding problem is then the following one: the whole mother point\nprocess is known as well as the coordinates of some daughter point; the\ndisplacements are only known through their law; can one find the mother of this\ndaughter point? The Shannon regime is that where the dimension $n$ tends to\ninfinity and where the logarithm of the intensity of the point process is\nproportional to $n$. We show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if\nthe sum of the proportionality factor and of the differential entropy rate of\nthe noise is positive, then the probability of finding the right mother point\ntends to 0 with $n$ for all point processes and decoding strategies. If this\nsum is negative, there exist mother point processes, for instance Poisson, and\ndecoding strategies, for instance maximum likelihood, for which the probability\nof finding the right mother tends to 1 with $n$. We then use large deviations\ntheory to show that in the latter case, if the entropy spectrum of the noise\nsatisfies a large deviation principle, then the error probability goes\nexponentially fast to 0 with an exponent that is given in closed form in terms\nof the rate function of the noise entropy spectrum. This is done for two\nclasses of mother point processes: Poisson and Mat\\'ern.

With first-principles DFT calculations, it is demonstrated\ntheoretically that the band gap of graphene can be opened effectively around K\n(or K') points by doping the small BN domains. It is also found that the random\ndoping with B or N is possible to open a small gap in the Dirac points, except\nfor the modulation of Fermi level. The surface charge which belongs to the\n$\\pi$ states near Dirac points is found to be redistributed locally. The charge\nredistribution is contributed to the change of localized potential due to the\ndoping effects. This may be the reason that the energy states near Dirac points\nis just disturbed in the energy region [-0.4eV, 0.4eV] for the doping of BN\ndomain. Thus, we suggest that the band opening induced by the doped BN domain\nis due to the breaking of localized symmetry of the potential. Doping graphene\nwith BN domains is an effective method to open a band gap with quasi-linear\ndissipation near Dirac point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 10:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

A large part of the paper is devoted to the\nanalysis of the kinematics of an elastic body interacting with a gravitational\nfield. We think this could have some interest in itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 13:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 09:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

In parameterisation I we assume that the\nT is an input parameter. We find that parameterisation I can hardly constrain\nthe cluster parameters. We then investigate parameterisations II and III in\nwhich fg(r200) replaces temperature as a main variable. In parameterisation II\nwe relate M_T(r200) and T assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that\nparameterisation II can constrain the cluster physical parameters but the\ntemperature estimate is biased low. In parameterisation III, the virial theorem\nreplaces the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. We find that parameterisation\nIII results in unbiased estimates of the cluster properties. We generate a\nsecond simulated cluster using a generalised NFW (GNFW) pressure profile and\nanalyse it with an entropy based model to take into account the temperature\ngradient in our analysis and improve the cluster gas density distribution. This\nmodel also constrains the cluster physical parameters and the results show a\nradial decline in the gas temperature as expected. The mean cluster total mass\nestimates are also within 1 sigma from the simulated cluster true values.\nHowever, we find that for at least interferometric SZ analysis in practice at\nthe present time, there is no differences in the AMI visibilities between the\ntwo models. This may of course change as the instruments improve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 14:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 17:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Fiedorowicz, from lectures given by J. Frank Adams at\nthe University of Chicago in spring of 1973. They give an elegant axiomatic\npresentation of localization and completion in algebraic topology. The\nconstruction of localization and completion functors with respect to an\narbitrary generalized homology theory is derived from the axioms by using the\nBrown representability theorem. These notes were never formally published, due\nto an apparent flaw in the proof. The relevant representable functors could not\nbe shown to be set-valued, as opposed to class-valued. Subsequent work by A. K.\nBousfield established the existence of these functors, using more technical\nsimplicial methods. These functors are now an essential tool in homotopy\ntheory. The notes also contain an addendum devoted to establishing that a\ncertain element in the gamma family of the stable homotopy groups of spheres is\nnonzero, using Brown-Peterson homology. At that time this was a matter of\ncontroversy, as S. Oka and H. Toda claimed to have proved the contrary result.\n  Besides being of historical interest, these notes give a very readable\nintroduction to localization and completion, with minimal prerequisites.

Over its first five years it will be collecting data for six public\nsurveys, one of these is the near-infrared YJKsVISTA survey of the Magellanic\nClouds system (VMC). This survey comprises the LMC, the SMC, the Bridge\nconnecting the two galaxies and two fields in the Stream. This paper provides\nan overview of the VMC survey strategy and presents first science results. The\nmain goals of the VMC survey are the determination of the spatially resolved\nSFH and 3D structure of the Magellanic system. Therefore, the VMC survey is\ndesigned to reach stars as faint as the oldest main sequence turn-off point and\nto constrain the mean magnitude of pulsating variable stars such as RR Lyrae\nstars and Cepheids. This paper focuses on observations of VMC fields in the LMC\nobtained between November 2009 and March 2010. These observations correspond to\na 7% completeness of the LMC fields. The VMC observations consist of\nmulti-epoch measurements organised following a specific structure. The data\nwere reduced using the VISTA Data Flow System pipeline whose source catalogues\nwere produced and made available via the VISTA Science Archive. The analysis of\nthe data shows that the sensitivity in each wave band agrees with expectations.\nUncertainties and completeness of the data are also derived. The first science\nresults, aimed at assessing the science quality of the VMC data, include an\noverview of the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude and colour-colour\ndiagrams, the detection of planetary nebulae and of stellar clusters, and the\nKs band light-curve of variable stars. The VMC survey represents a tremendous\nimprovement, in spatial resolution and sensitivity, on previous panoramic\nobservations of the Magellanic system in the near-infrared and complements\nnicely the deep observations at other wavelengths.
