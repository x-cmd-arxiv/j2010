Logic formulas with user-defined recursive functions are used to\nspecify properties on the program states before/after program executions.\n  Three basic functions are introduced to represents memory access,\nrecord-field access and array-element access. Some axioms are introduced to\nspecify these basic functions in our logic.\n  The concept Memory Scope Function (MSF) is introduced in our logic. Given a\nrecursive function $f$, the MSF of $f$ computes the set of memory units\naccessed during the evaluation of $f$. A set of rules are given to derive the\ndefinition of this MSF syntactically from the definition of $f$. As MSFs are\nalso recursive functions, they also have their MSFs. An axiom is given to\nspecify that an MSF contains its MSF. Based on this axiom, local reasoning is\nsupported with predicate variables.\n  Pre-state terms are used to specify the relations between pre-states and\npost-states. People can use pre-state terms in post-conditions to represents\nthe values on the pre-state.\n  The axiom of assignment statements in Hoare's logic is modified to deal with\npointers. The basic idea is that during the program execution, a recursive\nfunction is evaluated to the same value as long as no memory unit in its memory\nscope is modified. Another proof rule is added for memory allocation\nstatements.\n  We use a simple example to show that our logic can deal with pointer programs\nin this paper. In the appendix, the Shorre-Waite algorithm is proved using our\nlogic. We also use the selection-sort program to show that our logic can be\nused to prove program with indirectly-specified components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 16:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

Focusing on the gas content, we analyze the effect of relative\nvelocity on the properties of halos over a wide range of halo masses and\nredshifts. We calculate accurately the linear evolution of the baryon and dark\nmatter fluctuations, and quantify the resulting effect on halos based on an\nanalytical formalism that has been carefully checked with simulations in the\ncase with no relative velocity. We estimate the effect on the abundance of and\ngas fraction in early halos. We find that the relative velocity effect causes\nseveral changes: (i) the characteristic mass that divides gas-rich and gas-poor\nhalos is increased by roughly an order of magnitude, from 2 10^4 Msun to about\n2 10^5 Msun; (ii) this characteristic mass has a large scatter (full width at\nhalf maximum is ~ 1.5 10^5 Msun at z=20); (iii) the fraction of baryons in\nstar-less gas minihalos is suppressed by a factor of 4 at z=20; (iv) the\nfraction of baryons in halos that can cool and form stars is suppressed by a\nfactor of 1.5 at z=20; and (v) there are enhanced spatial variations of these\nvarious fractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 18:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

For the HMF model, we show numerically that the relaxation time of these\nstates diverges with $N$ with the exponent $\\gamma \\simeq 1$. The method,\napplicable to other models with globally coupled particles, also allows an\nexact evaluation of the stability limit of homogeneous steady states. In some\ncases it provides a good approximation for the correspondence between the\ninitial condition and the final steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2010 22:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 09:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-09"}

For given vacuum\nexpectation values of the moduli scalars, we provide phenomenological aspects\nof the vacuum fluctuations and phase transitions in the supersymmetry breaking\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 02:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

These theories explore the low energy\ndynamics of the microscopic degrees of freedom of coincident M2 branes and\nconstitute the boundary conformal field theories of the bulk AdS4 / S7 exact\n11-dimensional supergravity backgrounds of supermembranes. These mysterious new\nsymmetries, the Filippov-Nambu 3-algebras represent the implementation of\nnon-associative algebras of coordinates of charged tensionless strings, the\nboundaries of open M2 branes in antisymmetric field magnetic backgrounds of M5\nbranes in the M2 -M5 system. A crucial input into this construction came from\nthe study of the M2-M5 system in the Basu- Harvey's work where an equation\ndescribing the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad- Sommerfeld (BPS) bound state of multiple\nM2-branes ending on an M5 was formulated. The Filippov-Nambu 3-algebras are\neither operator or matrix representation of the classical Nambu symmetries of\nworld volume preserving diffeomorphisms of M2 branes. Indeed at the classical\nlevel the supermembrane Lagrangian, in the covariant formulation, has the world\nvolume preserving diffeomorphisms symmetry SDiff(M2+1).

We find that most GC systems possess an obvious negative\ngradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). For GC systems displaying color\nbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations present shallower\nbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these two\nsubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. The FOV of ACS mainly restricts\nus to measuring the inner gradients of GC systems. These gradients, however,\ncan introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of GC\nsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. Inferred corrections\nto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the mean\ncolor of metal-poor GCs and their host galaxy luminosity. The GC color\ngradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens are\nweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarf\ngalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar mass\nof M_stellar~10^10M_sun. We also measure color gradients for field stars in the\nhost galaxies. We find that GC color gradients are systematically steeper than\nfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is the\nsame for both. If gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse and\nweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner GC\nsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidly\nwith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. The lack of\nstrong gradients in the GC systems of dwarfs, which probably have not\nexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos were\ninefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of GC formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 05:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In rugby ball\nsolutions, for which two compact extra dimensions are stabilized in the\npresence of only positive-tension brane sources, the effects of brane\nback-reaction can be computed explicitly. This allows the calculation of the\nshape of the low-energy pGB potential and response of the extra dimensional\ngeometry as a function of the perturbing brane properties. If the\npGB-dependence is a small part of the total brane tension a very general\nanalysis is possible, permitting an exploration of how the system responds to\nfrustration when the two branes disagree on what the proper scalar vacuum\nshould be. We show how the low-energy potential is given by the sum of brane\ntensions (in agreement with common lore) when only the brane tensions couple to\nthe pGB. We also show how a direct brane coupling to the flux stabilizing the\nextra dimensions corrects this result in a way that does not simply amount to\nthe contribution of the flux to the brane tensions. We calculate the mass of\nthe would-be zero mode, and briefly describe several potential applications,\nincluding a brane realization of `natural inflation,' and a dynamical mechanism\nfor suppressing the couplings of the pGB to matter localized on the branes.\nSince the scalar can be light enough to be relevant to precision tests of\ngravity (in a technically natural way) this mechanism can be relevant to\nevading phenomenological bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 06:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-18"}

We\nuse computational modeling to show that B cell affinity discrimination requires\nthat kinetic proofreading predominate over serial engagement. We find that if\nBCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding antigen, the\nloss in serial engagement as affinity increases results in weaker signaling\nwith increasing affinity. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR for\nseveral seconds before the latter becomes signaling-capable, similar to kinetic\nproofreading, is needed to overcome the loss in serial engagement due to\nincreasing antigen affinity, and replicate the monotonic increase in B cell\nsignaling with affinity observed in B cell activation experiments. This finding\nmatches well with the experimentally observed time (~ 20 seconds) required for\nthe BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and lipid raft-mediated\nconformational changes that lead to Src-family kinase recruitment. We\nhypothesize that the physical basis of the threshold time of antigen binding\nmay lie in the formation timescale of BCR dimers. The latter decreases with\nincreasing affinity, resulting in shorter threshold antigen binding times as\naffinity increases. Such an affinity-dependent kinetic proofreading requirement\nresults in affinity discrimination very similar to that observed in biological\nexperiments.

Consequently, the relative cooling powers are significantly\nimproved, the microscopic mechanism of which is related to the effect of the\ninterfaces at La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrRuO3 and higher nanostructural disorder. This\nstudy indicates that artificial oxide superlattices/multilayers might provide\nan alternative pathway in searching for efficient room-temperature magnetic\nrefrigerators for (nano)microscale systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 09:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-10"}

We study whether\nsimilar results occur for a broader class of modular functions, including\nfunctions of polynomial growth, and of exponential growth at the cusp. Hints on\ntheir long horocycle average are derived by translating the horocycle flow\ndynamical problem in string theory language. Results are then proved by\ndesigning an unfolding trick involving a Theta series, related to the spectral\nEisenstein series by Mellin integral transform.

The small scatterers can be particles whose physical\nproperties are described by the boundary impedances, or they can be small\ninhomogeneities, whose physical properties are described by their refraction\ncoefficients. Equations for the effective field in the limiting medium are\nderived. The limit is considered as the size $a$ of the particles or\ninhomogeneities tends to zero while their number $M(a)$ tends to infinity.\nThese results are applied to the problem of creating materials with a desired\nrefraction coefficient.

The concept consistently describes\nthe galactic rotation curves, the inflation of the universe and its accelerated\nexpansion, all without the necessity of Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE).\nInstead, the effects attributed to DM are caused by a reduction of inertia\nacting as an enhancement of gravity. These results of MMC are similar to that\nof MOND. The effects usually attributed to DE in MMC stem from a new equation\nof state for baryonic matter, which always causes a negative pressure. In this\nrespect the results are similar to those of the two component LCDM. In\nparticular, according to MMC the late universe will pass into a state of\nconstant energy density.
