This problem can be overcome by applying an eccentricity-removal\nprocedure which consists in evolving the binary for a couple of orbits,\nestimating the eccentricity, and then correcting the initial conditions. The\npresence of spins can complicate this procedure. As predicted by post-Newtonian\ntheory, spin-spin interactions and precession prevent the binary from moving\nalong an adiabatic sequence of spherical orbits, inducing oscillations in the\nradial separation and in the orbital frequency. However, spin-induced\noscillations occur at approximately twice the orbital frequency, therefore they\ncan be distinguished from the initial spurious eccentricity, which occurs at\napproximately the orbital frequency. We develop a new removal procedure based\non the derivative of the orbital frequency and find that it is successful in\nreducing the eccentricity measured in the orbital frequency to less than 0.0001\nwhen moderate spins are present. We test this new procedure using\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binary black holes with mass ratios 1.5 and\n3, spin magnitude 0.5 and various spin orientations. The numerical simulations\nexhibit spin-induced oscillations in the dynamics at approximately twice the\norbital frequency.

The Tupi telescopes are\nwithin the central region of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), which allows\nparticle detectors to achieve a low rigidity of response to primary and\nsecondary charged particles ($\\geq 0.1$ GV). Here we argue for the possibility\nof a \"scale-free\" energy distribution of particles accelerated by solar flares.\nLarge and small scale flares have the same energy spectrum up to energies\nexceeding the pion production, the difference between them is only the\nintensity. If this hypothesis is correct, the Tupi telescope is registering\nmuons produced by protons (ions) whose energy corresponds to the tail of the\nspectrum. Consequently the energy distribution of the emitted protons has to be\na power law spectrum, since power law distributions are characterized as scale\nfree distributions. The Tupi events give support to this conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 17:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The observations, from the\norbiting Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI), provide the most complete measure\nof the whole-coma brightness, free from the effects of instrumental saturation\nand with a time-resolution well-matched to the rapid brightening of the comet.\nThe lightcurve is divided into two distinct parts. A rapid rise between the\nfirst SMEI observation on UT 2007 October 24 06h 37m (mid-integration) and UT\n2007 October 25, is followed by a slow decline until the last SMEI observation\non UT 2008 April 6 22h 16m (mid-integration).

Both lag their corresponding populations in Q4 by approximately 30 km/s.\nInterestingly, the Disk stars in Q1 also appear to participate in the\nrotational lag by about 30 km/s. The enhanced rotational lag for the Thick Disk\nin Q1 extends to 4 kpc or more from the Sun. At 3 to 4 kpc, our sight lines\nextend above the density contours on the near side of the bar, and as our lines\nof sight pass directly over the bar the rotational lag appears to decrease.\nThis is consistent with a \"gravitational wake\" induced by the rotating bar in\nthe Disk which would trap and pile up stars behind it.

The\nevolution in the total merger rate is modest out to z ~ 0.7, although the wet\nand dry populations have different evolutionary trends. At higher redshifts dry\nmergers make a smaller contribution to the total merging galaxy population, but\nthis is offset by a roughly equivalent increase in the contribution from wet\nmergers.

Aims: To study the effects of cosmic ray ion (H, He, CNO and\nFe-Co-Ni) and electron bombardment of PAHs in galactic and extragalactic\nenvironments. Methods: We calculate the nuclear and electronic interactions for\ncollisions between PAHs and cosmic ray ions and electrons with energies between\n5 MeV/nucleon and 10 GeV, above the threshold for carbon atom loss, in normal\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and cooling flow galaxy clusters. Results: The\ntimescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic\nexcitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.\nSmall PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more\neffective projectiles. For electron collisions, the lifetime is independent of\nthe PAH size and varies with the threshold energy To. Conclusions: Cosmic rays\nprocess the PAHs in diffuse clouds, where the destruction due to interstellar\nshocks is less efficient. In the hot gas filling galactic halos, outflows of\nstarburst galaxies and intra-cluster medium, PAH destruction is dominated by\ncollisions with thermal ions and electrons, but this mechanism is ineffective\nif the molecules are in denser cloudlets and isolated from the hot gas. Cosmic\nrays can access the denser clouds and together with X-rays will set the\nlifetime of those protected PAHs. This limits the use of PAHs as a`dye' for\ntracing the presence of cold entrained material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

An analysis of the velocity structure of the ICM for simulated\ncluster-size haloes, especially focusing on rotational patterns, has been\nperformed, demonstrating them to be an intermittent phenomenon, strongly\nrelated to the internal dynamics of substructures. We find that the expected\nbuild-up of rotation due to mass assembly gets easily destroyed by passages of\ngas-rich substructures close to the central region.

However, the\nderivation of the scaling property of an IPL liquid is based on reduced\nquantities, for example, the reduced relaxation time equal to T^1/2V^-1/3 times\nthe actual relaxation time. The difference between scaling using reduced rather\nthan unreduced units is negligible in the supercooled regime; however, at\nhigher temperature the difference can be substantial, accounting for the\npurported breakdown of the scaling and giving rise to different values of the\nscaling exponent. Only the {\\gamma} obtained using reduced quantities can be\nsensibly related to the intermolecular potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 21:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Depending on the\nlocation of the latter there are two possibilities: the D3 either remains\nseparate from the flavor branes or dissolves in them and becomes a flavor\ninstanton. The leading order interaction between the baryons is a competition\nbetween the attraction and the repulsion due to the sigma and omega mesons. The\nlightest 0++ particle sigma is a pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the\nspontaneous breaking of scale invariance. In a certain range of parameters it\nis parametrically lighter than any other massive state. As a result at large\ndistances baryons attract each other. At short distances the potential admits a\nrepulsive core due to an exchange of the omega vector meson. We discuss baryon\ncoupling to glueballs, massive mesons and pions and point out the condition for\nthe model to have a small binding energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 21:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We build on\ntheir work to express K-theoretically the structures of full CFT. In\nparticular, the modular invariant partition functions (which essentially\nparametrise the possible full CFTs) have a rich interpretation within von\nNeumann algebras (subfactors), which has led to the developments of structures\nof full CFT such as the full system (fusion ring of defect lines), nimrep\n(cylindrical partition function), alpha-induction etc. Modular categorical\ninterpretations for these have followed. For the generic families of modular\ninvariants (i.e. those associated to Dynkin diagram symmetries), we provide a\nK-theoretic framework for these other CFT structures, and show how they relate\nto D-brane charges and charge-groups. We also study conformal embeddings and\nthe E7 modular invariant of SU(2), as well as some families of finite group\ndoubles. This new K-theoretic framework allows us to simplify and extend the\nless transparent, more ad hoc descriptions of these structures obtained\npreviously within CFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 23:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 17:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-18"}

In numerical charged-particle map generation, fields along a reference\ntrajectory are differentiated multiple times. Any attempt to differentiate\ndirectly such field data multiple times is soon dominated by \"noise\" due to\nfinite meshing and/or measurement errors. This problem can be overcome by the\nuse of field data on a surface outside of the reference trajectory to\nreconstruct the fields along and around the reference trajectory. The integral\nkernels for Laplace's equation that provide interior fields in terms of\nboundary data or boundary sources are smoothing: interior fields will be\nanalytic even if the boundary data or source distributions fail to be\ndifferentiable or are even discontinuous. In our approach, we employ all three\ncomponents of the field on the surface to find a superposition of single-layer\nand double-layer surface source distributions that can be used together with\nsimple, surface-shape-independent kernels for computing vector potentials and\ntheir multiple derivatives (required for a Hamiltonian map integration) at\ninterior points. These distributions and kernels are found by the aid of\nHelmholtz's theorem (or equivalently, by Green's theorem). A novel application\nof the Dirac-monopole vector potential is used to find a kernel for the\nsingle-layer distribution. These methods are the basis for map-generating\nmodules that can be added to existing numerical electromagnetic field-solving\ncodes and would produce transfer maps to any order for arbitrary static\ncharged-particle beamline elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 23:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

Two distinct sets of exploratory observations\nwere undertaken, and used to test the SASSy approach and data reduction\npipeline. The first was a 0.5 by 0.5 degrees map around the nearby galaxy NGC\n2559. The galaxy was easily detected at 156 mJy, but no other convincing\nsources are present in the map.

Due to this tremendous growth, there has\nbeen a significant increase in spam traffic. Spam messes up user's inbox,\nconsumes network resources and spread worms and viruses. In this paper we study\nthe characteristics of spam and the technology used by spammers. In order to\ncounter anti spam technology, spammers change their mode of operation,\ntherefore continues evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers\ntechnology has become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the\nexisting anti spam technology and thereby help us to combat spam effectively.\nIn order to characterize spam, we collected four hundred thousand spam mails\nfrom a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months from January 2006 to\nFebruary 2007. For analysis we classified spam based on attachment and\ncontents. We observed that spammers use software tools to send spam with\nattachment. The main features of this software are hiding sender's identity,\nrandomly selecting text messages, identifying open relay machines, mass mailing\ncapability and defining spamming duration. Spammers do not use spam software to\nsend spam without attachment. From our study we observed that, four years old\nheavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years old light users\nmail accounts. Relatively new email accounts which are 14 months old do not\nreceive spam. But in some special cases like DDoS attacks, we found that new\nemail accounts receive spam and 14 months old heavy users email accounts have\nattracted more spam than 14 months old light users. We believe that this\nanalysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 01:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

This\nmotivates us in this work to develop a novel design framework and alternative\nmethods that take advantage of several unexploited design choices in the\nrouting and the scheduling strategy spaces.

The\nemergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing\npresence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and\nveterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention\nshould be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a\nnew compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential\nequations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter\ndriven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted\ncontact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions\nand the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for\neach set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among\nregions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not\nonly treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated\ninto the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data\nfrom the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the\nepidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive\nset of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for\naccurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the\nworld. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model\ndifferentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different\nprovinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the\noutbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction\nnumber is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction\nnumber are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 04:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 03:16:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 15:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

From the CNe rate and stellar mass-loss rate, this\nclearing mechanism predicts that ~ 0.03 M_sun should be present in <= 10^5\nM_sun GCs. We model the expanding remnant made from the 10^-4 M_sun nova ejecta\nand show that it escapes long before it has cooled.

We find that nova shells are effective at\nclearing the ICM in low-mass GCs (<= 10^5 M_sun), whereas higher-mass clusters\nmay experience a quiescent time between novae long enough to prevent the next\nnova shell from escaping. The nova clearing mechanism will also operate in\nultra-faint Milky Way satellites, where many upper limits on gas masses are\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 04:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Interestingly, however, some of the observational\nproperties cannot be readily explained within the standard scheme of stellar\nevolution, and those are rather reminiscent of young stellar objects. In the\npresent research we considered the evolutionary status of IRAS 19312+1950 as\nrevealed by the VLBI and MERLIN observations in SiO, H2O and OH maser lines.\nThe double-peaked profile of the 22 GHz H2O maser line is clearly detected,\nwith the emission regions of its red and blue-shifted components separately\nlocated, leaving a space of about 10.9 mas between them. The kinematic\nproperties of H2O maser emission region appear to be more consistent with a\nbipolar flow rather than other interpretations such as the Keplerian rotation\nof a disk. The red-shifted component of the SiO maser emission, which exhibits\na double-peak profile in previous single-dish observations, is clearly detected\nin the present interferometry, while the 1612 MHz OH maser line exhibits a\ncomplicated line profile consisting of a single strong peak and many weak,\nhigh-velocity spikes. The structure of OH maser emission region is partially\nresolved, and the kinematic properties of the OH maser emission region are\nreminiscent observations of a spherically expanding shell, even though the\nevidence is scant. Collectively, the maser observations described here provide\nadditional support for the evolved star hypothesis for IRAS 19312+1950.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 07:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We explore what can be learned from spectroscopic\nand interferometric observations about the properties of the rotation law in\nthe external layers of these objects. Using simple relations between the\nentropy and specific rotational quantities, some of which are found to be\nefficient at accounting for the solar differential rotation in the convective\nregion, we derived analytical solutions that represent possible differential\nrotations in the envelope of early-type stars. A surface latitudinal\ndifferential rotation may not only be an external imprint of the inner\nrotation, but induces changes in the stellar geometry, the gravitational\ndarkening, the aspect of spectral line profiles, and the emitted spectral\nenergy distribution. By studying the equation of the surface of stars with\nnon-conservative rotation laws, we conclude that objects undergo geometrical\ndeformations that are a function of the latitudinal differential rotation able\nto be scrutinized both spectroscopically and by interferometry. The combination\nof Fourier analysis of spectral lines with model atmospheres provides\nindependent estimates of the surface latitudinal differential rotation and the\ninclination angle. Models of stars at different evolutionary stages rotating\nwith internal conservative rotation laws were calculated to show that the Roche\napproximation can be safely used to account for the gravitational potential.\nThe surface temperature gradient in rapid rotators induce an acceleration to\nthe surface angular velocity.

However, it was recently suggested by Allaverdi, Dutta and\none of the authors (R.N.M.) that mixed, or bimodal, flavor neutrino scenarios\nare conceivable and are consistent with all known observations (these were\ncalled \"schizophrenic\" in the ADM paper). In that case each individual mass\neigenstate can be either Dirac or Majorana, so that the flavor eigenstates are\n\"large\" admixtures of both. An example of this \"bimodal\" situation is to\nconsider one mass state as a Dirac particle (with a sterile partner), while the\nother two are of Majorana type. Since only Majorana particles contribute to\nneutrinoless double beta decay, the usual dependence of this observable on the\nneutrino mass is modified within this scenario. We study this in detail and, in\nparticular, generalize the idea for all possible bimodal combinations.\nInevitably, radiative corrections will induce a pseudo-Dirac nature to the\nDirac states at the one-loop level, and the effects of the pseudo-Dirac mass\nsplitting will show up in the flavor ratios of neutrinos from distant\ncosmological sources. Comparison of the effective mass in neutrinoless double\nbeta decay as well as flavor ratios at neutrino telescopes, for different\npseudo-Dirac cases and with their usual phenomenology, can distinguish the\ndifferent bimodal possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2010 13:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2011 12:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-05"}

In detail, we first combine the substitutional method and the\nseparation method to construct a new class of analytical solutions for that\nsystem. In fact, we perturb the linear velocity: u=c(t)x+b(t), and substitute\nit into the system. Then, by comparing the coefficients of the polynomial, we\ncan deduce the functional differential equations involving\n$(c(t),b(t),\\rho^{2}(0,t)).$ Additionally, we could apply the Hubble's\ntransformation c(t)={\\dot{a}(3t)}/{a(3t)}, to simplify the ordinary\ndifferential system involving $(a(3t),b(t),\\rho ^{2}(0,t))$. After proving the\nglobal or local existences of the corresponding dynamical system, a new class\nof analytical solutions is shown. And the corresponding solutions in radial\nsymmetry are also given. To determine that the solutions exist globally or blow\nup, we just use the qualitative properties about the well-known Emden equation:\n{array} [c]{c} {d^{2}/{dt^{2}}}a(3t)= {\\xi}{a^{1/3}(3t)}, a(0)=a_{0}>0\n,\\dot{a}(0)=a_{1} {array} .
