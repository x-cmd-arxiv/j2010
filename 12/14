The motivation arises from molecular systems\nbiology. and, in particular, the recent discovery of an important transient\nproperty, related to Weber's law in psychophysics: \"fold-change detection\" in\nadapting systems, the property that scale uncertainty does not affect\nresponses. FCD appears to play an important role in key signaling transduction\nmechanisms in eukaryotes, including the ERK and Wnt pathways, as well as in\nE.coli and possibly other prokaryotic chemotaxis pathways. In this paper, we\nprovide further theoretical results regarding this property. Far more\ngenerally, we develop a necessary and sufficient characterization of adapting\nsystems whose transient behaviors are invariant under the action of a set\n(often, a group) of symmetries in their sensory field. A particular instance is\nFCD, which amounts to invariance under the action of the multiplicative group\nof positive real numbers. Our main result is framed in terms of a notion which\nextends equivariant actions of compact Lie groups. Its proof relies upon\ncontrol theoretic tools, and in particular the uniqueness theorem for minimal\nrealizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 16:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The goal was to\ndetermine the stability of the radio cores, and to assess structure effects\nassociated with positions in the ICRF. Although the four sources were compact\nat 8.6 GHz, the VLBA images at 43 GHz with 0.3-mas resolution showed that all\nwere composed of several components. A component in each source was identified\nas the radio core using some or all of the following emission properties:\ncompactness, spectral index, location at the end of the extended emission\nregion, and stationary in the sky. Over the observing period, the relative\npositions between the four radio cores were constant to 0.02 mas---the phase\nreferencing positional accuracy obtained at 23 and 43 GHz among the\nsources---suggesting that once a radio core is identified, it remains\nstationary in the sky to this accuracy. Other radio components in two of the\nfour sources had detectable motion in the radio jet direction. Comparison of\nthe 23 and 43 GHz VLBA images with the VLBA 8.6 GHz images and the ICRF\npositions suggests that some ICRF positions are dominated by a moving jet\ncomponent; hence, they can be displaced up to 0.5 mas from the radio core, and\nmay also reflect the motion of the jet component. Future astrometric efforts to\ndetermine a more accurate quasar reference frame at 23 and 43 GHz and from the\nVLBI2010 project are discussed, and supporting VLBA or EVN observations of ICRF\nsources at 43 GHz are recommended in order to determine the internal structure\nof the sources.

The\nTP-AGB can dominate the NIR flux of a coeval stellar population between ~0.1\nand ~2 Gyr, and the strong features of (especially C-rich) TP-AGB stars are\nuseful chronometers in integrated light studies. Likewise, the Paschen series\nin MSTO stars is stongly dependent on age and is an indicator of a young\nstellar component in integrated spectra. We define four NIR spectroscopic\nindices to measure the strength of absorption features from both C-rich TP-AGB\nstars and hydrogen features in main sequence stars, in a preliminary effort to\nconstruct a robust chronometer that probes the contributions from stars in\ndifferent evolutionary phases. By comparing the values of the indices measured\nin M32 and NGC 5102 to those in the Maraston (2005) stellar population\nsynthesis models for various ages and metallicities, we show that model\npredictions for the ages of the nuclei of M32 and NGC 5102 agree with previous\nresults obtained from integrated optical spectroscopy and CMD analysis of the\ngiant branches.

Moreover,\nthere are epochs during which star formation is enhanced in the feedback run\nrelative to its radiative cooling only counterpart.

Our\nmethod consists of locating the frame from which the magnitude of the\n$(\\ell=2,|m|=2)$ modes is maximized, which we denote the \"quadrupole-aligned\"\nframe. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method when applied to waveforms\nfrom numerical simulations. In the test case of an equal-mass nonspinning\nbinary, our method locates the direction of the orbital angular momentum to\nwithin $(\\Delta \\theta, \\Delta \\phi) = (0.05^{\\circ},0.2^{\\circ})$. We then\napply the method to a $q = M_2/M_1 = 3$ binary that exhibits significant\nprecession. In general a spinning binary's orbital angular momentum\n$\\mathbf{L}$ is \\emph{not} orthogonal to the orbital plane. Evidence that our\nmethod locates the direction of $\\mathbf{L}$ rather than the normal of the\norbital plane is provided by comparison with post-Newtonian (PN) results.

These\napproximations present comprehensive analytical descriptions of LZS\ninterference in most of parameter space of frequency and decoherence rate,\nagreeing well with those of the numerical simulations and providing a simple\nbut integrated understanding to system dynamics. The application of our models\nto microwave cooling can obtain the minimal frequency to realize effective\nmicrowave cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 01:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 22:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

For all of these effects we present a case study of their impact\non the cosmology derived by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey\n(SDSS-II SN Survey). Correcting supernova redshifts for the CMB dipole slightly\nover-corrects nearby supernovae that share some of our local motion. We show\nthat while neglecting the CMB dipole would cause a shift in the derived\nequation of state of Delta w ~ 0.04 (at fixed matter density) the additional\nlocal-motion correction is currently negligible (Delta w<0.01). We use a\ncovariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiar\nvelocities. This down-weights nearby supernovae and effectively acts as a\ngraduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. Neglecting coherent\nvelocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of ~2% in the\npreferred value of w and will therefore have to be considered carefully when\nfuture surveys aim for percent-level accuracy. Finally, we perform n-body\nsimulations to estimate the likely magnitude of any local density fluctuation\n(monopole) and estimate the impact as a function of the low-redshift cutoff.

To progress in the understanding of evolution of massive stars one\nneeds to constrain the mass-loss and determine the phenomenon responsible for\nthe ejection of matter an its reorganization in the circumstellar environment\nAims. In order to test various mass-ejection processes, we probed the geometry\nand kinematics of the dust and gas surrounding the A[e] supergiant HD 62623.\nMethods. We used the combined high spectral and spatial resolution covered by\nthe VLTI/AMBER instrument. Thanks to a new multiwavelength optical/IR\ninterferometry imaging technique, we reconstructed the first velocity-resolved\nimages with a milliarcsecond resolution in the infrared domain. Results. We\nmanaged to disentangle the dust and gas emission in the HD 62623 circumstellar\ndisc.We measured the dusty disc inner inner rim, i.e. 6 mas, constrained the\ninclination angle and the position angle of the major-axis of the disc.We also\nmeasured the inner gaseous disc extension (2 mas) and probed its velocity field\nthanks to AMBER high spectral resolution. We find that the expansion velocity\nis negligible, and that Keplerian rotation is a favoured velocity field. Such a\nvelocity field is unexpected if fast rotation of the central star alone is the\nmain mechanism of matter ejection. Conclusions. As the star itself seems to\nrotate below its breakup-up velocity, rotation cannot explain the formation of\nthe dense equatorial disc. Moreover, as the expansion velocity is negligible,\nradiatively driven wind is also not a suitable explanation to explain the disc\nformation. Consequently, the most probable hypothesis is that the accumulation\nof matter in the equatorial plane is due to the presence of the spectroscopic\nlow mass companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 08:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

Using\nscaling indices as test statistics we find highly significant signatures for\nnon-Gaussianities when considering all scales. We test for NGs in the bands l =\n[2,20], l = [20,60], l = [60,120] and l = [120,300].

The number or size of the output clusters is not\nconstrained in any way. The best known approximation algorithm for this problem\ngives a factor of 11. This result and all previous ones involve solving large\nlinear or semi-definite programs which become prohibitive even for modestly\nsized tasks. In this paper we present an improved factor 4 approximation\nalgorithm to this problem using a simple combinatorial algorithm which does not\nrequire solving large convex programs. The analysis extends a method developed\nby Ailon, Charikar and Alantha in 2008, where a randomized pivoting algorithm\nwas analyzed for obtaining a 3-approximation algorithm for Correlation\nClustering, which is the same problem on graphs (not bipartite). The analysis\nfor Correlation Clustering there required defining events for structures\ncontaining 3 vertices and using the probability of these events to produce a\nfeasible solution to a dual of a certain natural LP bounding the optimal cost.\nIt is tempting here to use sets of 4 vertices, which are the smallest\nstructures for which contradictions arise for Bipartite Correlation Clustering.\nThis simple idea, however, appears to be evasive. We show that, by modifying\nthe LP, we can analyze algorithms which take into consideration subgraph\nstructures of unbounded size.

The stellar velocity field shows circular rotation but\ndeviations are observed close to the minor axis which can be attributed to\nstellar motions possibly associated to a nuclear bar. The stellar velocity\ndispersion of the bulge is 162km/s leading to a black hole mass of\nM_BH=5.5x10^7M_sun based on the M_BH-sigma relationship. The gas kinematics is\ndominated by non-circular motions and the subtraction of the stellar velocity\nfield reveals blueshifts of ~-100km/s on the far side of the galaxy and a few\nredshifts on the near side. These characteristics can be interpreted in terms\nof streaming towards the center if the gas is in the plane. On the basis of the\nobserved velocities and geometry of the flow, we estimate a mass inflow rate in\nionized gas of ~4.0x10^-3M_sun/year, which is of the order of the accretion\nrate necessary to power the LINER nucleus of M81. We have also applied the\ntechnique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to our data, which reveals the\npresence of a rotating nuclear gas disk within ~50pc from the nucleus and a\ncompact outflow, approximately perpendicular to the disk. The PCA combined with\nthe observed gas velocity field shows that the nuclear disk is being fed by gas\ncirculating in the galaxy plane. The presence of the outflow is supported by a\ncompact jet seen in radio observations at a similar orientation, as well as by\nan enhancement of the [OI]\\Halpha line ratio, probably resulting from shock\nexcitation of the circumnuclear gas by the radio jet. With these observations\nwe are thus resolving both the feeding -- via the nuclear disk and observed gas\ninflow, and the feedback -- via the outflow, around the nucleus of M81.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 13:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
