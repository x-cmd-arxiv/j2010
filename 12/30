In [The fundamental progroupoid of a general topos, Journal of\nPure and Applied Algebra 212 (2008)] we had introduced the notion of\n\\emph{covering projection} in a topos.

In neurophysiological\nexperiments, the neuronal firing moments are registered, but not the state of\ncommunication lines. But future spiking moments depend essentially on the past\npositions of impulses in the lines. This suggests, that the sequence of\nintervals between firing moments (interspike intervals, ISIs) in the network\ncould be non-Markovian. In this paper, we address this question for a simplest\npossible neural \"net\", namely, a single neuron with delayed feedback. The\nneuron receives excitatory input both from the driving Poisson stream and from\nits own output through the feedback line. We obtain analytical expressions for\nconditional probability density $P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1,t_0)$, which gives the\nprobability to get an output ISI of duration $t_{n+1}$ provided the previous\n$(n+1)$ output ISIs had durations $t_n,...,t_1,t_0$.

This has made it possible to easily study the structure of multi-loop\namplitudes in the theory. In this paper we describe a remarkable fact revealed\nby these investigations: the integrand can be expressed in an amazingly simple\nand manifestly local form when represented in momentum-twistor space using a\nset of chiral integrals with unit leading singularities. As examples, we\npresent very-concise expressions for all 2- and 3-loop MHV integrands, as well\nas all 2-loop NMHV integrands.

The new local forms of the integrand are closely\nconnected to leading singularities---matching only a small subset of all\nleading singularities remarkably suffices to determine the full integrand.\nThese results strongly suggest the existence of a theory for the integrand\ndirectly yielding these local expressions, allowing for a more direct\nunderstanding of the emergence of local spacetime physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 20:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

As a result, the\nfraction of quiescent galaxies in the overall galaxy population increases with\nstellar mass in the redshift range. The fraction of quiescent galaxies at\n10^{11}-10^{11.5} Msun increases from ~20-30% at z~2 to ~40-60% at z~0.75,\nwhile that at 10^{10}-10^{10.5} Msun increases from <~ 5% to ~15% in the same\nredshift range. These results could suggest that the quenching of star\nformation had been more effective in more massive galaxies at 1<~z<~2. Such a\nmass-dependent quenching could explain the rapid increase of the number density\nof ~M* galaxies relative to lower-mass galaxies at z >~ 1-1.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 07:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We find that submm flux density and star formation rate\n(SFR) are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming\ngalaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced\nstarburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust\nmass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature\nduring the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux\ndensity (e.g., a $\\ga16$x boost in SFR yields a $\\la 2$x boost in submm flux\ndensity). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to SFR differs\nsignificantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies\nwith highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest\nbolometric luminosity or SFR. These results have important consequences for the\nbright submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG) population. Among them are: 1. The\nSMG population is heterogeneous.

Target\noutflow profiles specify the desirable inter-departure times of packets leaving\nthe switch from each traffic stream. The goal of the switch scheduler is to\ndynamically select service configurations of the switch, so that actual outflow\nstreams (\"pulled\" through the switch) adhere to their desired target profiles\nas accurately as possible. Dynamic service controls (schedules) are developed\nto minimize deviation of actual outflow streams from their targets and suppress\nstream \"distortion\". Using appropriately selected subsets of service\nconfigurations of the switch, efficient schedules are designed, which deliver\nhigh performance at relatively low complexity. Some of these schedules are\nprovably shown to achieve 100% pull-throughput. Moreover, simulations\ndemonstrate that for even substantial contention of streams through the switch,\ndue to stringent/intense target outflow profiles, the proposed schedules\nachieve closely their target profiles and suppress stream distortion. The\nswitch model investigated here deviates from the classical switching paradigm.\nIn the latter, the goal of packet scheduling is primarily to \"push\" as much\ntraffic load through the switch as possible, while controlling delay to\ntraverse the switch and keeping congestion/backlogs from exploding.

By\nconsidering pulses with mixed directions and finite width controlled by\nmagnetic fields, it is shown that pulse-width accumulation degrades the\nperformance of sequences with larger number of pulses and feasible magnetic\nfields in practice restrict the consideration to sequences with number of\ndecoupling pulses being less than 10 within each cycle.

This gives a 4d\nconstruction of \"axion monodromy inflation\": the axion winds many times over\nthe course of inflation and draws energy from the 4-form. The classical theory\nis equivalent to chaotic inflation with a quadratic inflaton potential. Such\nmodels can produce \"high scale\" inflation driven by energy densities of the\norder of $(10^{16}\\ GeV)^4$, which produces primordial gravitational waves\npotentially accessible to CMB polarization experiments. We analyze the possible\ncorrections to this scenario from the standpoint of 4d effective field theory,\nidentifying the physics which potentially suppresses dangerous corrections to\nthe slow-roll potential. This yields a constraint relation between the axion\ndecay constant, the inflaton mass, and the 4-form charge. We show how these\nmodels can evade the fundamental constraints which typically make high-scale\ninflation difficult to realize. Specifically, the moduli coupling to the\naxion-four-form sector must have masses higher than the inflationary Hubble\nscale ($\\la\\ 10^{14}\\ GeV$). There are also constraints from states that become\nlight due to multiple windings of the axion, as happens in explicit string\ntheory constructions of this scenario. Further, such models generally have a\nquantum-mechanical \"tunneling mode\" in which the axion jumps between windings,\nwhich must be suppressed.

It is shown that the proposed\nmethod can select significant components and estimate nonparametric additive\nfunction components simultaneously with an optimal convergence rate\nsimultaneously. To make the LSM stable in computation and able to adapt its\nestimators to the level of smoothness of the component functions, weighted\npower spline bases and projected weighted power spline bases are proposed.\nTheir performance is examined by simulation studies across two set-ups with\nindependent predictors and correlated predictors, respectively, and appears\nsuperior to the performance of competing methods.

I\nhave applied some modification to the global Earliest Deadline First (EDF)\nalgorithms to decrease the number of task migration and also to add\npredictability to its behavior. The Aim of this work is to provide a\nsensitivity analysis for task deadline context of multiprocessor system by\nusing a new approach of EFDF (Earliest Feasible Deadline First) algorithm. In\norder to decrease the number of migrations we prevent a job from moving one\nprocessor to another processor if it is among the m higher priority jobs.\nTherefore, a job will continue its execution on the same processor if possible\n(processor affinity). The result of these comparisons outlines some situations\nwhere one scheme is preferable over the other. Partitioning schemes are better\nsuited for hard real-time systems, while a global scheme is preferable for soft\nreal-time systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 08:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

Second, the use of cryptography can be more or less\nregulated, not to say forbidden, according to the countries. If the right to\nfreely protect our personal and private data is a fundamental right, it must\nnot hinder the action of Nation States with respect to National security.\nAllowing encryption to citizens holds for bad guys as well.\n  In this paper we propose a new approach in information and communication\nsecurity that may solve all these issues, thus representing a rather\ninteresting trade-off between apparently opposite security needs. We introduce\nthe concept of scalable security based on computationnally hard problem of\ncoding theory with the PERSEUS technology.\n  The core idea is to encode date with variable punctured convolutional codes\nin such a way that any cryptanalytic attempt will require a time-consuming\nencoder reconstruction in order to decode. By adding noise in a suitable way,\nthat reconstruction becomes untractable in practice except for Intelligence\nservices that however must use supercomputers during a significant, scalable\namount of time. Hence it limits naturally any will to unduly performs such\nattacks (eg. against citizens' privacy).\n  On the users' side, encoder and noise parameters are first exchanged through\nan initial, short HTTPS session. The principles behind that approach have been\nmathematically validated in 1997 and 2007. We present the PERSEUS library we\nhave developed under the triple GPL/LGPL/MPL licences.

This result can be explained in two different formalisms.\nFirst, by noting its relation to the \\delta-biased family introduced by Dodis\nand Smith, we demonstrate that Renner's two-universal hashing lemma is\ngeneralized to our class of hash functions. Next, we prove that the proof\ntechnique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy\namplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD\nsystem to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\ntype, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear\ncode of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical\nerror correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a\nsimilar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our\nresults in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the\nShor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace\ndistance and Holevo information, than the method based on the \\delta-biased\nfamily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 10:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2011 09:19:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 10:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 08:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

On the contrary,\nconsideration of quantum circuits/protocols and organic molecules as software\nand hardware of living systems that are co-optimized during evolution, may be\nuseful to overcome the difficulties raised by biochemical complexity and to\nunderstand the physics of life. In this sense, we review quantum\ninformation-theoretic approaches to the process of DNA replication and propose\na new model in which 1) molecular recognition of a nucleobase is assumed to\ntrigger an intrabase entanglement corresponding to a superposition of different\ntautomer forms and 2) pairing of complementary nucleobases is described by\nswapping intrabase entanglements with interbase entanglements. We examine\npossible biochemical realizations of quantum circuits/protocols to be used to\nobtain intrabase and interbase entanglements. We deal with the problem of\ncellular decoherence by using the theory of decoherence-free subspaces and\nsubsystems.

We\npropose an explicit and consistent framework for the valuation of insurance\nliabilities which incorporates the Solvency II approach as a special case.\n  The proposed framework is based on dynamic replication over multiple\n(one-year) time periods by a portfolio of assets with reliable market prices,\nallowing for \"limited liability\" in the sense that the replication can in\ngeneral not always be continued. The asset portfolio consist of two parts: (1)\nassets whose market price defines the value of the insurance liabilities, and\n(2) capital funds used to cover risk which cannot be replicated. The capital\nfunds give rise to capital costs; the main exogenous input of the framework is\nthe condition on when the investment of the capital funds is acceptable.\n  We investigate existence of the value and show that the exact calculation of\nthe value has to be done recursively backwards in time, starting at the end of\nthe lifetime of the insurance liabilities. The main question only partially\nconsidered in this paper is the uniqueness of the value. We derive upper bounds\non the value and, for the special case of replication by risk-free one-year\nzero-coupon bonds, explicit recursive formulas for calculating the value.\n  Valuation in Solvency II and IFRS 4 is based on representing the value as a\nsum of a \"best estimate\" and a \"risk margin\". In our framework, it turns out\nthat this split is not natural. Nonetheless, we show that a split can be\nconstructed as a simplification, and that it provides an upper bound on the\nvalue under suitable conditions. We illustrate the general results by\nexplicitly calculating the value for a simple example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 13:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

Here we\nreport a finding of pressure- induced suppression of the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc and enhancement of the temperature of the resistance\nhump TH through charge transfer between two iron sites with different\noccupancies. The activation energy for the electric transport of the\nhigh-temperature resistance is observed to go to zero at a critical pressure of\n8.7 GPa, at which superconductivity tends to disappear and the\nsemiconductor-to-metal transition takes place. Beyond the critical point, the\nresistance exhibits a metallic behavior over the whole temperature range\nstudied. All these features indicate the existence of quantum criticality in\niron-selenide superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 14:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 15:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 May 2012 07:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

We present a thin\nsoftware layer ameliorates adverse effects of dynamic task distribution by\nsorting tasks into locality queues, each of which is preferably processed by\nthreads that belong to the same locality domain. Dynamic scheduling is fully\npreserved inside each domain, and is preferred over possible load imbalance\neven if nonlocal access is required, making this strategy well-suited for\ntypical multicore-mutisocket systems. The effectiveness of the approach is\ndemonstrated by using a blocked six-point stencil solver as a toy model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 14:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}
