(i) We report a comprehensive characterization of\nIP traffic on smartphones using traces collected from 27 iPhone 3GS users for\nthree months. (ii) Driven by the findings from the characterization, we devise\ntwo novel system mechanisms for mobile devices to sup-port seamless flow\nmigration without network support, and extensively evaluate their effectiveness\nusing our field collected traces of real-life usage. Wait-n-Migrate leverages\nthe fact that most flows are short lived. It establishes new flows on newly\navailable networks but allows pre-existing flows on the old network to\nterminate naturally, effectively decreasing, or even eliminating, connectivity\ngaps during network switches. Resumption Agent takes advantage of the\nfunctionality integrated into many modern protocols to securely resume flows\nwithout application intervention. When combined, Wait-n-Migrate and Resumption\nAgent provide an unprecedented opportunity to immediately deploy performance\nand efficiency-enhancing policies that leverage multiple networks to improve\nthe performance, efficiency, and connectivity of mobile devices. (iii) Finally,\nwe report an iPhone 3GS based implementation of these two system mechanisms and\nshow that their overhead is negligible. Furthermore, we employ an example\nnetwork switching policy, called AutoSwitch, to demonstrate their performance.\nAutoSwitch improves the Wi-Fi user experience by intelligently migrating TCP\nflows between Wi-Fi and cellular networks.

The work is based on two-dimensional bulge-disk\ndecompositions of Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 um images of 57 galaxies with MBH estimates.\nOur estimates of effective radii (Re) and surface brightnesses, combined with\nvelocity dispersions (sigma) from the literature, define a FP relation\nconsistent with previous determinations but doubling the observed range in Re.\nNone of our galaxies is an outlier of the FP, demonstrating the accuracy of our\nbulge-disk decomposition which also allows us to independently identify\npseudobulges in our sample. We calibrate M/L at 3.6 um by using the tight\nMdyn-Lbul relation (~0.1 dex of rms) and find that no color corrections are\nrequired to estimate the stellar mass. The 3.6 um luminosity is thus the best\ntracer of Mstar yet studied. We then explore the connection between MBH and\nbulge structural parameters (luminosity, mass, effective radius). We find tight\ncorrelations of MBH with both 3.6 um bulge luminosity and dynamical mass\n(MBH/Mdyn~1/1000), with rms of ~0.35 dex, similar to the MBH-sigma relation.\nOur results are consistent with previous determinations at shorter wavelengths.\nBy using our calibrated M/L, we rescale MBH-Lbul to obtain the MBH-Mstar\nrelation, which can be used as the local reference for high-z studies which\nprobe the cosmic evolution of MBH-galaxy relations and where the stellar mass\nis inferred directly from luminosity measurements.

Using this method, all\nresonances of the same order can be described by one equation, with\napplications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling. We focus on the\nlimit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive\nplanet. We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends\non the relative migration rate of the planet and particle, and the particle's\neccentricity. Resonant capture fails for high migration rates, and has\ndecreasing probability for higher eccentricities. More massive planets can\ncapture particles at higher eccentricities and migration rates. We also\ncalculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for\ncaptured particles, and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur.\nLibration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity.

The links between cargo and motors are\nconsidered as non linear springs. By means of numerical simulations we compute\nthe relevant quantities characterizing the dynamical properties of the system,\nand we compare the results to those for non interacting motors.

Despite the importance of this problem,\nwhen considering the sliding windows model of streaming (where elements\neventually expire) the problem of finding L_2-heavy elements has remained\ncompletely open despite multiple papers and considerable success in finding\nL_1-heavy elements.\n  In this paper, we develop the first poly-logarithmic-memory algorithm for\nfinding L_2-heavy elements in sliding window model. Since L_2 heavy elements\nplay a central role for many fundamental streaming problems (such as frequency\nmoments), we believe our method would be extremely useful for many\nsliding-windows algorithms and applications. For example, our technique allows\nus not only to find L_2-heavy elements, but also heavy elements with respect to\nany L_p for 0<p<2 on sliding windows. Thus, our paper completely resolves the\nquestion of finding L_p-heavy elements for sliding windows with\npoly-logarithmic memory for all values of p since it is well known that for p>2\nthis task is impossible.\n  Our method may have other applications as well. We demonstrate a broader\napplicability of our novel yet simple method on two additional examples: we\nshow how to obtain a sliding window approximation of other properties such as\nthe similarity of two streams, or the fraction of elements that appear exactly\na specified number of times within the window (the rarity problem).

For\ngravitational waves, the dominant contribution is characterized by an effective\nstress-energy tensor at future null infinity. We employ perturbation theory and\nthe short-wavelength approximation to compute this stress-energy tensor in a\nwide class of alternative theories. We find that this tensor is generally a\nmodification of that first computed by Isaacson, where the corrections can\ndominate over the general relativistic term. In a wide class of theories,\nhowever, these corrections identically vanish at asymptotically flat, future,\nnull infinity, reducing the stress-energy tensor to Isaacson's. We exemplify\nthis phenomenon by first considering dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity,\nwhich corrects the action via a scalar field and the contraction of the Riemann\ntensor and its dual. We then consider a wide class of theories with dynamical\nscalar fields coupled to higher-order curvature invariants, and show that the\ngravitational wave stress-energy tensor still reduces to Isaacson's.

We show that\ngalaxies with bulges fitted by the Sersic index n<2 (pseudobulges) have quite\ndifferent distributions of their structural parameters than galaxies with n>=2\nbulges (classical bulges). First of all, the distribution of the apparent bulge\naxis ratio q_b for the subsample with n<2 can be attributed to triaxial, nearly\nprolate bulges, while n>=2 bulges seem to be oblate spheroids with moderate\nflattening. Secondly, the Photometric Plane of the sample bulges is not flat\nand has a prominent curvature towards small values of n. Thirdly, despite of\nthe existence of a clear relation between the flattening of stellar discs h/z_0\nand the relative mass of a spherical component, the distributions over both\nparameters are quite different for galaxies possesing bulges and pseudobulges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 21:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-16"}

Using a simple analytic model related to\nthe so-called maximally compact equation of state, model-independent upper\nlimits to thermodynamic properties in neutron stars, such as energy density,\npressure, baryon number density and chemical potential, are established which\ndepend upon the neutron star maximum mass. Using the largest well-measured\nneutron star mass, 1.97 M$_\\odot$, it is possible to show that the energy\ndensity can never exceed about 2 GeV, the pressure about 1.3 GeV, and the\nbaryon chemical potential about 2.1 GeV. Further, if quark matter comprises a\nsignificant component of neutron star cores, these limits are reduced to 1.3\nGeV, 0.9 GeV, and 1.5 GeV, respectively.

The\nform factors are defined as an extension of the ordinary stable particles and\nare directly evaluated from the meson-baryon scattering amplitude, paying\nattention to the charge conservation of the probe interaction. For the resonant\nLambda(1405) state we calculate the density distributions in two ways. One is\non the pole position of the Lambda(1405) in the complex energy plane, which\nevaluates the resonant Lambda(1405) structure without contamination from\nnonresonant backgrounds, and another on the real energy axis around the\nLambda(1405) resonance energy, which may be achieved in experiments. Using\nsereval probe interactions and channel decomposition, we separate the various\ncontributions to the internal structure of the Lambda(1405). As a result, we\nfind that the resonant Lambda(1405) state is composed of widely spread Kbar\naround N, which gives dominant component inside the Lambda(1405), with escaping\npi Sigma component. Furthermore, we consider Kbar N bound state without decay\nchannels, with which we can observe the internal structure of the bound state\nwithin real numbers. We also study the dependence of the form factors on the\nbinding energy and meson mass. This verifies that the form factor defined\nthrough the scattering amplitude serves as a natural generalization of the form\nfactor for the resonance state. The relation between the interaction strength\nand the meson mass shows that the physical kaon mass appears to be within the\nsuitable range to form a molecular bound state with the nucleon through the\nchiral SU(3) interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 05:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2011 07:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Atmospheric muon neutrino\nspectra and anisotropy in Deep Core at ten-tens GeV (yet unpublished) may test\nthe muon-tau conversion but they can hardly reveal such last tiny MINOS CPT\nasymmetry. We show how the longest baseline neutrino oscillation available,\ncrossing most of the Earth diameter, within an OPERA-like experiment from CERN\n(or FERMILAB) to ICECUBE-Deep Core neutrino detector at 21 GeV energy, may at\nbest disentangle even last tiny CPT violation (within 6 sigma a year) while\ntesting at highest rate tau-antitau appearance. We propose the muon neutrino\ndisappearance or (for any CPT violation) the partial anti-muon appearance at\nthe longest distances. Such a tuned detection experiment may lead to a clear\nand strong signature of tau or anti-tau generation (even within its neutral\ncurrent noise background events): nearly one antitau or two tau a day. The tau\nappearance signal is above (or within) 10 sigma a year, even for 1% OPERA-like\nexperiment. Peculiar configurations for theta_13 angle test and hierarchy\nneutrino mass test may also be addressed by a Deep Core-PINGU array detector\nobserving electron neutrino shower at 6 GeV neutrino energy windows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 08:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 16:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 10:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 14:25:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 17:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-21"}

In the case of\nbosons, we consider the Hartree approximation that becomes exact in a proper\nthermodynamic limit. The equilibrium configurations are solutions of the mean\nfield Schr\\\"odinger equation with a cosine interaction. We show that the\nhomogeneous phase, that is unstable in the classical regime, becomes stable in\nthe quantum regime. This takes place through a first order phase transition for\nfermions and through a second order phase transition for bosons where the\ncontrol parameter is the normalized Planck constant. In the case of fermions,\nthe homogeneous phase is stabilized by the Pauli exclusion principle while for\nbosons the stabilization is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As a\nresult, the thermodynamic limit is different for fermions and bosons. We point\nout analogies between the quantum HMF model and the concepts of fermion and\nboson stars in astrophysics. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we\nobtain new results concerning the Vlasov dynamical stability of the waterbag\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 11:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

The geodesics can be classified according to the test particle's\nenergy, angular momentum and momentum in the direction of the string axis. We\ndiscuss how the change of the magnetic fluxes, the ratio between the symmetry\nbreaking scale and the Planck mass, the Higgs to gauge boson mass ratios and\nthe binding between the F- and D-strings, respectively, influence the motion of\nthe test particles. While massless test particles can only move on escape\norbits, a new feature as compared to the infinitely thin string limit is the\nexistence of bound orbits for massive test particles. In particular, we observe\nthat - in contrast to the space-time of a single Abelian-Higgs string - bound\norbits for massive test particles in (p,q)-string space-times are possible if\nthe Higgs boson mass is larger than the gauge boson mass. We also compute the\neffect of the binding between the p- and the q-string on observables such as\nthe light deflection and the perihelion shift. While light deflection can also\nbe caused by other matter distributions, the possibility of a negative\nperihelion shift seems to be a feature of finite width cosmic strings that\ncould lead to the unmistakable identification of such objects.

The changes are more dramatic under\ncompression, in that the vacancy becomes non-magnetic when graphene is\ncompressed more than 2%.

For compressions slightly greater than 3%, this rippling leads to the\nformation of a heavily reconstructed vacancy structure that consists of two\ndeformed hexagons and pentagons.

Those gap openings are characterized by a redistribution of\nspectral weight of the optical conductivity in an energy region much larger\nthan the gap energies indicating that strong electron-electron correlations are\ninvolved in the formation of the charge gap. Calculations of the optical\nconductivity from the band structure also provided evidence for the presence of\nstrong electronic correlations. Analyzing the spectra with a fundamental\nabsorption across the gap of parabolic bands yields a direct gap at 130 meV and\ntwo indirect gaps at 6 and 31 meV. The strong reduction in the free-carrier\nconcentration at low energies and low temperatures is also reflected in a\nchange in the asymmetry of the phonon absorption which indicates a change in\nthe phonon-conduction-electron interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 13:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-16"}

While young low-mass stars show a wide range of rotation\nperiods, many CTTS are slow rotators, spinning at a small fraction of break-up,\nand their rotation period does not seem to shorten, despite the fact that they\nare actively accreting and contracting. Matt & Pudritz (2005) proposed that the\nspin-down torque of a stellar wind powered by a fraction of the accretion\nenergy would be strong enough to balance the spin-up torque due to accretion.\nSince this model establishes a direct relation between accretion and ejection,\nthe observable stellar parameters (mass, radius, rotation period, magnetic\nfield) and the accretion diagnostics (accretion shock luminosity), can be used\nto constraint the wind characteristics. In particular, since the accretion\nenergy powers both the stellar wind and the shock emission, we show in this\nletter how the accretion shock luminosity L_UV can provide upper limits to the\nspin-down efficiency of the stellar wind. It is found that luminous sources\nwith L_UV > 0.1 L_Sun and typical dipolar field components < 1 kG do not allow\nspin equilibrium solutions. Lower luminosity stars (L_UV < 0.1 L_Sun) are\ncompatible with a zero-torque condition, but the corresponding stellar winds\nare still very demanding in terms of mass and energy flux. We therefore\nconclude that accretion powered stellar winds are unlikely to be the sole\nmechanism to provide an efficient spin-down torque for accreting classical T\nTauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 13:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We\nuse this data to show that with a torus geometry, unobscured sight lines can\nachieve a maximum EW of the Fe K\\alpha line of ~150 eV, originally shown by\nGhisellini, Haardt & Matt (1994). In order for this to be exceeded, the line of\nsight must be obscured with N_H>10^23 cm^-2, as we show for one case, NGC 3690.\nWe also calculate flux suppression factors from the simulated data, the main\nconclusion from which is that for N_H>10^25 cm^-2, the X-ray flux is suppressed\nby a factor of >10 in all X-ray bands and at all redshifts, revealing the\nbiases present against these extremely heavily obscured systems inherent in all\nX-ray surveys. Furthermore, we confirm previous results from Murphy & Yaqoob\n(2009) that show that the reflection fraction determined from slab geometries\nis underestimated with respect to toroidal geometries.

We determine a Compton thick fraction for the X-ray AGN in our sample\nto be 18+/-5% which is higher than the hard X-ray (>10 keV) selected samples.\nFinally we find that the obscured fraction for our sample is a strong function\nof X-ray luminosity, peaking at L_X~10^42-43 ergs s^-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 14:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Since the complexity and cost factors in scaling\nthe infrastructure exist, we propose a novel solution for providing and\ndelivering contents to clients by introducing a brokered collaborative content\ndelivery system. The architectural design of this system leverages content\nredundancy and content distribution mechanisms in other content providers to\ndeliver contents to the clients. With the recent emergence of cloud computing,\nwe show that this system can also be adopted to run on the cloud. In this\npaper, we focus on a brokering scheme to mediate user requests to the most\nappropriate content provider based on a ranking system. The architecture\nprovides a novel Global Rank Value (GRV) concept in estimating content provider\ncapability and transforming the QoS requirement of a content request. A\nfairness model that will bring this design to be attractive to the current\ncontent delivery regime is also introduced. Through simulation, we show that\nusing fair provider selection, contents can be provisioned by a better pool of\nqualified providers thus leveraging the collaboration and preventing potential\nQoS violation that may occur when the size of pool is smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 14:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 12:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-15"}

Our analysis combines three previously published transit\nlight curves with seven new transits, which were observed between February 2008\nand May 2009 with the new MagIC-e2V instrument on the Magellan Telescopes in\nChile. We provide a revised planetary radius of R_p = 1.23+/-0.07 R_J, which is\nslightly larger than, but consistent within the errors, of the previously\npublished results. Analysis of the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital\nseparation, inclination and transit duration reveals no apparent variation in\nany of those parameters during the time span observed. We also find no sign of\ntransit timing variations larger than -108+/-49 s, with most residuals very\nclose to zero. This allows us to place an upper limit of 5-10 M_Earth for a\ncoplanar, low-eccentricity perturber in either the 2:1 or 3:2 mean-motion\nresonance with OGLE-TR-132b. We similarly find that the data are entirely\nconsistent with a constant orbital period and there is no evidence for orbital\ndecay within the limits of precision of our data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 15:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}

In\nthis paper, we will construct a well-balanced gas-kinetic\nsymplecticity-preserving BGK (SP-BGK) scheme. In order to develop such a\nscheme, we model the gravitational potential as a piecewise step function with\na potential jump at the cell interface. At the same time, the Liouville's\ntheorem and symplecticity preserving property of a Hamiltonian flow have been\nused in the description of particles penetration, reflection, and deformation\nthrough a potential barrier. The use of the symplecticity preserving property\nfor a Hamiltonian flow is crucial in the evaluation of the high-order moments\nof a gas distribution function when crossing through a potential jump. As far\nas we know, the SP-BGK method is the first shock capturing Navier-Stokes flow\nsolver with well-balanced property for a gravitational hydrodynamic system. A\nfew theorems will be proved for this scheme, which include the necessity to use\nan exact Maxwellian for keeping the hydrostatic state, the total mass and\nenergy (the sum of kinetic, thermal, and gravitational ones) conservation, and\nthe well-balanced property to keep a hydrostatic state during particle\ntransport and collision processes. Many numerical examples will be presented to\nvalidate the SP-BGK scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 15:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-16"}

The\nfree-particle Klein-Gordon equation for scalar fields modestly extends the\nclassical wave equation via a mass term. It is physically untenable for\ncomplex-valued wave functions, but has a sound nonnegative conserved-energy\nfunctional when it is restricted to real-valued classical fields. Canonical\nHamiltonization and a further canonical transformation maps the real-valued\nclassical Klein-Gordon field and its canonical conjugate into the real and\nimaginary parts of a scalar wave function (within a constant factor) which in\nconsequence satisfies the time-dependent Schroedinger equation whose\nHamiltonian operator has the natural correspondence-principle relativistic\nsquare-root form for a free particle, with a mass that matches the Klein-Gordon\nfield theory's mass term. Quantization of the real-valued classical\nKlein-Gordon field is thus second quantization of this natural\ncorrespondence-principle first-quantized relativistic Schroedinger equation.\nSource-free electromagnetism is treated in a parallel manner, but with the\nclassical scalar Klein-Gordon field replaced by a transverse vector potential\nthat satisfies the classical wave equation.
