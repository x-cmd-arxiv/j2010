Here\nwe report on our first results from an ongoing BAL monitoring campaign of a\nsample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2<z<2.9, focusing on C IV 1549 BAL\nvariability in two different time intervals: 4 to 9 months (short-term) and 3.8\nto 7.7 years (long-term) in the quasar rest-frame.

The\nvariability occurs typically in only portions of the BAL troughs. The\ncomponents at higher outflow velocities are more likely to vary than those at\nlower velocities, and weaker BALs are more likely to vary than stronger BALs.\nThe fractional change in BAL strength correlates inversely with the strength of\nthe BAL feature, but does not correlate with the outflow velocity.

In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization\nMethod), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for\nedge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and\ncommunity dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function\nexpressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random\nfluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics.\nOSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers\ndelivered by other techniques. We have also implemented sequential algorithms\ncombining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so that the community structure of\nvery large networks can be uncovered. Our method has a comparable performance\nas the best existing algorithms on artificial benchmark graphs. Several\napplications on real networks are shown as well.

Cosmic recombination proceeds far out of equilibrium\nbecause of a \"bottleneck\" at the $n=2$ level of hydrogen: atoms can only reach\nthe ground state via slow processes: two-photon decay or Lyman-$\\alpha$\nresonance escape. However, even a small primordial abundance of molecules could\nhave a large effect on the interline opacity in the recombination epoch and\nlead to an additional route for hydrogen recombination. Therefore, this paper\ncomputes the abundance of the H$_2$ molecule during the cosmic recombination\nepoch. Hydrogen molecules in the ground electronic levels X$^1\\Sigma^+_g$ can\neither form from the excited H$_2$ electronic levels B$^1\\Sigma^+_u$ and\nC$^1\\Pi_u$ or through the charged particles H$_2^+$, HeH$^+$ and H$^-$. We\nfollow the transitions among all of these species, resolving the rotational and\nvibrational sub-levels. Since the energies of the\nX$^1\\Sigma^+_g$--B$^1\\Sigma^+_u$ (Lyman band) and X$^1\\Sigma^+_g$-C$^1\\Pi_u$\n(Werner band) transitions are near the Lyman-$\\alpha$ energy, the distortion of\nthe CMB spectrum caused by escaped H Lyman-line photons accelerates both the\nformation and the destruction of H$_2$ due to this channel relative to the\nthermal rates. This causes the populations of H$_2$ molecules in\nX$^1\\Sigma^+_g$ energy levels to deviate from their thermal equilibrium\nabundances.

Recent observations have shown\nthat a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde\norbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.\nIt is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of\nthese misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after\nthe gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed\ninclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising\ncandidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the\nnon-linear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered\ninto an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being\nless than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or\ncompletely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18\nof the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for\nscattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must\nhave migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to\ntheir current positions. If stellar tides are unimportant $(Q_\\ast \\gtrsim\n10^7)$, disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters\npresent in these systems. Additionally, we find that the disruption and/or\nejection of Jupiter-mass planets deposits a Sun's worth of angular momentum\nonto the host star. For systems in which planet-planet scattering is common, we\npredict that planetary hosts have up to a 35% chance of possessing an obliquity\nrelative to the invariable plane of greater than 90 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The non-Abelian twisted Z_N states do not have\ntopologically protected gapless edge modes and, for N > 2, break time-reversal\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 00:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}

All delightful triangulations of toric surfaces\nhaving sectional genus $g\\leq1$ are completely classified and, for $g\\geq2$, a\nlower bound for the $2$- and $3$-secant degree, by means of the combinatorial\ngeometry and the singularities of non-delightful triangulations, is\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 13:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

We focus on\nthe transition from quasicircular inspiral to plunge, merger and ringdown.We\ncompare the EOB waveform to a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli (RWZ) waveform computed\nusing the hyperboloidal layer method and extracted at null infinity. Because\nthe EOB waveform keeps track analytically of most phase differences in the\nearly inspiral, we do not allow for any arbitrary time or phase shift between\nthe waveforms. The dynamics of the particle, common to both wave-generation\nformalisms, is driven by leading-order ${\\cal O}(\\nu)$ analytically--resummed\nradiation reaction. The EOB and the RWZ waveforms have an initial dephasing of\nabout $5\\times 10^{-4}$ rad and maintain then a remarkably accurate phase\ncoherence during the long inspiral ($\\sim 33$ orbits), accumulating only about\n$-2\\times 10^{-3}$ rad until the last stable orbit, i.e. $\\Delta\\phi/\\phi\\sim\n-5.95\\times 10^{-6}$.

Queue length\nexpression as measured in terms of number of packets involves Hurwitz-zeta\nfunction. When the entropy parameter q in Tsallis entropy is less than unity,\nthe distribution of packets yields power law behavior. In the limit q tending\nto unity, Tsallis entropy expression reduces to one due to Shannon and\nwell-known results of M/M/1 queuing system are recovered. Relationship between\nTsallis entropy parameter q and Hurst parameter H (measure of self-similarity)\nis postulated.
