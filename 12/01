This paper studies how the flexibility offered by network\nvirtualization can be used to improve Quality-of-Service parameters such as\nlatency, while taking into account allocation costs. A generic use case is\nconsidered where both the overall demand issued for a certain service (for\nexample, an SAP application in the cloud, or a gaming application) as well as\nthe origins of the requests change over time (e.g., due to time zone effects or\ndue to user mobility), and we present online and optimal offline strategies to\ncompute the number and location of the servers implementing this service. These\nalgorithms also allow us to study the fundamental benefits of dynamic resource\nallocation compared to static systems. Our simulation results confirm our\nexpectations that the gain of flexible server allocation is particularly high\nin scenarios with moderate dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 16:03:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 16:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 16:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2010 10:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

According to the Copenhagen school of quantum mechanics, the\nproton is sitting in the absolute Lorentz frame. If this hydrogen atom is\nobserved from a different Lorentz frame, there is a time-like separation\nlinearly mixed with the Bohr radius. Indeed, the time-separation is one of the\nessential variables in high-energy hadronic physics where the hadron is a bound\nstate of the quarks, while thoroughly hidden in the present form of quantum\nmechanics. It will be concluded that this variable is hidden in Feynman's rest\nof the universe. It is noted first that Feynman's Lorentz-invariant\ndifferential equation for the bound-state quarks has a set of solutions which\ndescribe all essential features of hadronic physics. These solutions explicitly\ndepend on the time separation between the quarks. This set also forms the\nmathematical basis for two-mode squeezed states in quantum optics, where both\nphotons are observable, but one of them can be treated a variable hidden in the\nrest of the universe. The physics of this two-mode state can then be translated\ninto the time-separation variable in the quark model. As in the case of the\nun-observed photon, the hidden time-separation variable manifests itself as an\nincrease in entropy and uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 16:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However, the majority of the existing\naggregation algorithms exhibit relevant dependability issues, when prospecting\ntheir use in real application environments. In this paper, we reveal some\ndependability issues of aggregation algorithms based on iterative averaging\ntechniques, giving some directions to solve them. This class of algorithms is\nconsidered robust (when compared to common tree-based approaches), being\nindependent from the used routing topology and providing an aggregation result\nat all nodes. However, their robustness is strongly challenged and their\ncorrectness often compromised, when changing the assumptions of their working\nenvironment to more realistic ones. The correctness of this class of algorithms\nrelies on the maintenance of a fundamental invariant, commonly designated as\n\"mass conservation\". We will argue that this main invariant is often broken in\npractical settings, and that additional mechanisms and modifications are\nrequired to maintain it, incurring in some degradation of the algorithms\nperformance. In particular, we discuss the behavior of three representative\nalgorithms Push-Sum Protocol, Push-Pull Gossip protocol and Distributed Random\nGrouping under asynchronous and faulty (with message loss and node crashes)\nenvironments. More specifically, we propose and evaluate two new versions of\nthe Push-Pull Gossip protocol, which solve its message interleaving problem\n(evidenced even in a synchronous operation mode).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 16:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

Gravitational\nlens systems provide another probe of the Hubble constant using time delay\nmeasurements. However, current investigations of ~20 time delay lenses, albeit\nof varying levels of sophistication, have resulted in different values of the\nHubble constant ranging from 50-80 km/s/Mpc. In order to reduce uncertainties,\nmore time delay measurements are essential together with better determined mass\nmodels (Oguri 2007, Saha et al. 2006). We propose a more efficient technique\nfor measuring time delays which does not require regular monitoring with a\nhigh-resolution interferometer array. The method uses double image and\nlong-axis quadruple lens systems in which the brighter component varies first\nand dominates the total flux density. Monitoring the total flux density with\nlow-resolution but high sensitivity radio telescopes provides the variation of\nthe brighter image and is used to trigger high-resolution observations which\ncan then be used to see the variation in the fainter image. We present\nsimulations of this method together with a pilot project using the WSRT\n(Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope) to trigger VLA (Very Large Array)\nobservations. This new method is promising for measuring time delays because it\nuses relatively small amounts of time on high-resolution telescopes. This will\nbe important because many SKA pathfinder telescopes, such as MeerKAT (Karoo\nArray Telescope) and ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder), have\nhigh sensitivity but limited resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 16:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

The significance of these\nresults is considerable. They may be interpreted as a signature of jet rotation\nabout its symmetry axis, thereby representing the only existing observational\nindications supporting the theory that jets extract angular momentum from\nstar-disk systems. However, the possibility that we are indeed observing jet\nrotation in pre-main sequence systems is undergoing active debate. To test the\nvalidity of a rotation argument, we must extend the survey to a larger sample,\nincluding younger sources. We present the latest results of a radial velocity\nanalysis on jets from Class 0 and I sources, using high resolution data from\nthe infrared spectrograph GNIRS on GEMINI South. We obtained infrared spectra\nprotostellar jets HH 34, HH 111-H, HH 212 NK1 and SK1. The [Fe II] emission was\nunresolved in all cases and so Doppler shifts across the jet width could not be\naccessed. The H_2 emission was resolved in all cases except HH 34. Doppler\nprofiles across the molecular emission were obtained, and gradients in radial\nvelocity of typically 3 km/s identified. Agreement with previous studies\nimplies they may be interpreted as jet rotation, leading to toroidal velocity\nand angular momentum flux estimates of 1.5 km/s and 1x10^-5 M_odot/yr AU km/s\nrespectively. However, caution is needed. For example, emission is asymmetric\nacross the jets from HH 212 suggesting a more complex interpretation is\nwarranted. Furthermore, observations for HH 212 and HH 111-H are conducted far\nfrom the source implying external influences are more likely to confuse the\nintrinsic flow kinematics. These observations demonstrate the difficulty of\nconducting this study from the ground, and highlight the necessity for high\nangular resolution via adaptive optics or space-based facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 17:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The universe including this paper and even the reader\nhim(her)self seems to be built up of ordinary matter only. Theoretically, the\nwell-known Sakharov's conditions remain the solid framework explaining the\ncircumstances that matter became dominant against the antimatter while the\nuniverse cools down and/or expands. On the other hand, the standard model for\nelementary particles apparently prevents at least two conditions out of them.\nIn this work, we introduce a systematic study of the antiparticle-to-particle\nratios measured in various $NN$ and $AA$ collisions over the last three\ndecades. It is obvious that the available experimental facilities turn to be\nable to perform nuclear collisions, in which the matter-antimatter asymmetry\nraises from $\\sim 0%$ at AGS to $\\sim 100%$ at LHC. Assuming that the final\nstate of hadronization in the nuclear collisions takes place along the\nfreezeout line, which is defined by a constant entropy density, various\nantiparticle-to-particle ratios are studied in framework of the hadron\nresonance gas (HRG) model. Implementing modified phase space and distribution\nfunction in the grand-canonical ensemble and taking into account the\nexperimental acceptance, the ratios of antiparticle-to-particle over the whole\nrange of center-of-mass-energies are very well reproduced by the HRG model.\nFurthermore, the antiproton-to-proton ratios measured by ALICE in $pp$\ncollisions is also very well described by the HRG model. It is likely to\nconclude that the LHC heavy-ion program will produce the same particle ratios\nas the $pp$ program implying the dynamics and evolution of the system would not\ndepend on the initial conditions. The ratios of bosons and baryons get very\nclose to unity indicating that the matter-antimatter asymmetry nearly vanishes\nat LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 17:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-08"}

The beta decay transition of 14C to\nthe ground state of 14N is calculated within the shell model using a model\nspace consisting of two 0p-shell holes within a closed 16O core. The effective\n0p-shell interaction is calculated up to second order in perturbation theory\nwith single-particle energies extracted from experiment.

In such\nsystems, there has so far been no firm evidence for an active, radio-emitting\njet like those found in `hard state' GBHs. VLBI observations of NGC 4051 show\nthree co-linear compact components. This structure resembles the core and outer\nhot spots seen in powerful, jet-dominated, extragalactic radio sources and\nsuggests the existence of a weak jet.\n  Radio monitoring of the core of NGC 4051 is complicated by the presence of\nsurrounding extended emission and by the changing array configurations of the\nVLA. Only in the A configuration is the core reasonably resolved. We have\ncarefully removed the contaminations of the core by extended emission in the\nvarious arrays. The resulting lightcurve shows no sign of large amplitude\nvariability (i.e. factor 50 %) over the 16 month period. Within the most\nsensitive configuration (A array) we see marginal evidence for radio core\nvariability of ~25% (~0.12 mJy at 8.4GHz) on a 2-week timescale, correlated\nwith X-ray variations. Even if the radio variations in NGC 4051 are real, the\npercentage variability is much less than in the X-ray band. Within the B\nconfiguration observations, where sensitivity is reduced, there is no sign of\ncorrelated X-ray/radio variability. The lack of radio variability in NGC 4051,\nwhich we commonly see in `hard state' GBHs, may be explained by orientation\neffects. Another possibility is that the radio emission arises from the X-ray\ncorona, although the linear structure of the compact radio components here is\nhard to explain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 18:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The proposed algorithm relaxes the\nusual assumption of the stationary noise model in sparse coding. This enables\nlearning from data corrupted with spatially varying noise or uncertainty,\ntypically obtained by laser range scanners or structured light depth cameras.\nSparse representations are learned from the Middlebury database disparity maps\nand then exploited in a two-layer graphical model for inferring depth from\nstereo, by including a sparsity prior on the learned features. Since they\ncapture higher-order dependencies in the depth structure, these priors can\ncomplement smoothness priors commonly used in depth inference based on Markov\nRandom Field (MRF) models. Inference on the proposed graph is achieved using an\nalternating iterative optimization technique, where the first layer is solved\nusing an existing MRF-based stereo matching algorithm, then held fixed as the\nsecond layer is solved using the proposed non-stationary sparse coding\nalgorithm. This leads to a general method for improving solutions of state of\nthe art MRF-based depth estimation algorithms. Our experimental results first\nshow that depth inference using learned representations leads to state of the\nart denoising of depth maps obtained from laser range scanners and a time of\nflight camera. Furthermore, we show that adding sparse priors improves the\nresults of two depth estimation methods: the classical graph cut algorithm by\nBoykov et al. and the more recent algorithm of Woodford et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 19:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 18:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Previous\nwork has shown that rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars\n(`millisecond proto-magnetars') produce outflows with energies, timescales, and\nmagnetizations sigma_0 (maximum Lorentz factor) that are consistent with those\nrequired to produce long GRBs. Here we extend this work in order to construct a\nself-consistent model that directly connects the properties of the central\nengine to the observed prompt emission. Just after the launch of the supernova\nshock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The\noutflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As\nthe magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux\ndominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet\nto clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the\nprompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:\nmagnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic\ndissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'\nspectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading\ndecreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t\n~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively\naccelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the\nprompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows.

In this work, we create detailed models for a range of old simple\nstellar populations (SSPs), to create a variety of realistic HB morphologies,\nfrom extended red clumps, to extreme blue HBs. We achieve this by utilising\nstellar tracks from the BaSTI database and implementing a different mass loss\nprescription for each SSP created, resulting in different HB morphologies.

Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and\noriginal observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each\nclass corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed\ncomputing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the\nevolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on\nwhether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority\nof existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction\nof randomness in TVGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 21:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 04:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 20:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

Though this is still a work in progress, much effort has\nbeen put toward this goal. A set of specific tools which are used in this\neffort are gauge/gravity dualities. This thesis consists of a specific\nimplementation of gauge/gravity dualities to describe k-strings of strongly\ncoupled gauge theories as objects dual to Dp-branes embedded in confining\nsupergravity backgrounds from low energy superstring field theory. Along with\nsuperstring theory, k-strings are also commonly investigated with lattice gauge\ntheory and Hamiltonian methods. A k-string is a colorless combination of\nquark-antiquark source pairs, between which a color flux tube develops. The two\nmost notable terms of the k-string energy are, for large quark anti-quark\nseparation L, the tension term, proportional to L, and the Coulombic 1/L\ncorrection, known as the Luscher term. This thesis provides an overview of\nsuperstring theories and how gauge/gravity dualities emerge from them. It shows\nin detail how these dualities can be used for the specific problem of\ncalculating the k-string energy in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 space-time dimensions as the\nenergy of Dp-branes in the dual gravitational theory. A detailed review of\nk-string tension calculations is given where good agreement is found with\nlattice gauge theory and Hamiltonian methods. In reviewing the k-string\ntension, we also touch on how different representations of k-strings can be\ndescribed with Dp-branes through gauge/gravity dualities.

To implement a multicast session,\nseveral light-trees may have to be used due to the limited fanouts of network\nnodes. Although many multicast routing algorithms have been proposed in order\nto reduce the total number of wavelength channels used (total cost) for a\nmulticast session, the maximum number of wavelengths required in one fiber link\n(link stress) and the end-to-end delay are two parameters which are not always\ntaken into consideration. It is known that the shortest path tree (SPT) results\nin the optimal end-to-end delay, but it can not be employed directly for\nmulticast routing in sparse light splitting WDM networks. Hence, we propose a\nnovel wavelength routing algorithm which tries to avoid the multicast incapable\nbranching nodes (MIBs, branching nodes without splitting capability) in the\nshortest-path-based multicast tree to diminish the link stress.

The effects are stronger for clusters at lower\nredshifts. We present X-ray signatures such as surface brightness profiles and\nemission lines in detail for a massive cluster at low redshift. In general,\nsoft emission (0.3-1.0 keV) is enhanced significantly by under-ionization, and\nthe enhancement can be nearly an order of magnitude near the shock radius. The\nmost prominent non-equilibrium ionization signature we found is the O VII and O\nVIII line ratio. The ratios for non-equilibrium ionization and collisional\nionization equilibrium models are different by more than an order of magnitude\nat radii beyond half of the shock radius.

A set of computational\nparameters are hypothesized that will give a dose plan that meets dosimetric\ncriteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric\ncriteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is\nfound. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters.\nThe purpose of this study is to improve HDR brachytherapy planning by\ndeveloping a new approach that directly optimizes the dose distribution based\non dosimetric criteria.\n  Method: We develop Inverse Planning by Integer Program (IPIP), an\noptimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast\nheuristic for it. We used our heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized\nprostate cancer patient image data sets from our clinic database. Dosimetry was\nevaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria.\n  Results: Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric\ncriteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The\naverage target coverage was 95%. The average computation time for IPIP was 30.1\nseconds on a Intel(R) CoreTM2 Duo CPU 1.67 GHz processor with 3 Gib RAM.\n  Conclusion: IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly\nincorporates dosimetric criteria. We have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically\nacceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in\nthis study, both in terms of dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required\nto determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and\ndosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 22:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave\nsuperconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)\npair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.\nAs is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in\na wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the\nexternal Zeeman splitting $\\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\\Gamma_c$, the\nsystem passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological\nsuperconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the\npair potential $\\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the\ntopological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological\nquantum critical point at $\\Gamma_c = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\mu^2}$, where $\\mu (>>\n\\Delta)$ is the chemical potential. On the other hand, since $\\Gamma_c >>\n\\Delta$, the Zeeman splitting required for the topological phase ($\\Gamma >\n\\Gamma_c$) far exceeds the value ($\\Gamma \\sim \\Delta$) above which an s-wave\npair potential is expected to vanish (and the system to become\nnon-superconducting) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We are thus led to\na situation that the topological superconducting phase appears to set in a\nparameter regime at which the system actually is non-superconducting in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling. In this paper we address the question of how a\npure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a\ntopological superconducting phase.

In\nthis work, we investigate in detail whether such cold gas is detectable using\nlow-ionisation metal absorption lines, such as CII \\lambda1334 as this\ntechnique has a proven observational record for detecting gaseous structures.\nUsing a large statistical sample of galaxies from the Mare Nostrum N-body+AMR\ncosmological simulation, we find that the typical covering fraction of the\ndense, cold gas in 10^12 Msun haloes at z~2.5 is lower than expected (~5%). In\naddition, the absorption signal by the interstellar medium of the galaxy itself\nturns out to be so deep and so broad in velocity space that it completely\ndrowns that of the filamentary gas.

While the age-rotation-activity\nrelation has been studied extensively in clusters younger than 500 Myr,\nempirically measured rotation periods are scarce for older ages. Using the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF), we have begun a survey of stellar rotation to\nmap out the late-stage evolution of the age-rotation-activity relation: the\nColumbia/Cornell/Caltech PTF (CCCP) survey of open clusters. The first CCCP\ntarget is the nearby ~600 Myr Hyades-analog Praesepe, where PTF has produced\nlight curves spanning more than 3 months and containing >150 measurements for\n~650 cluster members. Analyzing these light curves, we have measured rotation\nperiods for 40 K & M cluster members, filling the gap between the periods\npreviously reported for solar-type Hyads (Radick et al. 1987, Prosser et al.\n1995) and for a handful of low-mass Praesepe members (Scholz et al. 2007). Our\nmeasurements indicate that Praesepe's period-color relation undergoes at\ntransition at a characteristic spectral type of ~M1 --- from a well-defined\nsingular relation at higher mass, to a more scattered distribution of both fast\nand slow-rotators at lower masses.

The main contribution of this paper is the development of\na theoretical foundation for such a communication system. Specifically, we\ndevelop the additive inverse Gaussian (IG) noise channel model: a channel in\nwhich the information is corrupted by noise with an inverse Gaussian\ndistribution. We show that such a channel model is appropriate for molecular\ncommunication in fluid media - when propagation between transmitter and\nreceiver is governed by Brownian motion and when there is positive drift from\ntransmitter to receiver. Taking advantage of the available literature on the IG\ndistribution, upper and lower bounds on channel capacity are developed, and a\nmaximum likelihood receiver is derived. Theory and simulation results are\npresented which show that such a channel does not have a single quality measure\nanalogous to signal-to-noise ratio in the AWGN channel. It is also shown that\nthe use of multiple molecules leads to reduced error rate in a manner akin to\ndiversity order in wireless communications. Finally, we discuss some open\nproblems in molecular communications that arise from the IG system model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 02:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 14:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The viscous\nforce on fluid, arising from the gradient of the viscous stress-tensor,\ninvolves the second derivatives of the metric and does not vanish in the local\ninertial frame while the viscous stress-tensor itself vanishes so that inertial\nobservers detect no dissipation. We thus provide an entropy extremisation\nprinciple that leads to the DNS equation, which makes the hydrodynamical\nanalogy with gravity completely natural and obvious. Several implications of\nthese results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 07:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

The standard unified description of such systems is based on the\nformal quantization of the phenomenological Kirchhoff equations for the\ncorresponding circuits. In this paper a simplified version of the BCS theory\nfor superconductors is used to derive microscopic models for all types of small\nJosephson junctions. For these models the state-dependent individual tunneling\nof Cooper pairs couples ground pair states with excited pair states what leads\nto a more complicated structure of the lowest lying energy levels. In\nparticular, the highly degenerate levels emerge, which act as probability sinks\nfor the qubit. These models allow also for the coupling to phonons as an\nefficient mechanism of relaxation for all types of junctions. The alternative\nformulas concerning basic spectral parameters of superconducting qubits are\npresented and compared with the experimental data. Finally, the question\nwhether small Josephson junctions can be treated as macroscopic quantum systems\nis briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 09:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-02"}

Similarly the light curve of the binary was also evolving,\nindicating that the system evolved toward its merger. The violent phase of the\nmerger, marked by the systematic brightenning of the object, started in March\n2008, i.e. half a year before the outburst discovery.

This results in the expectation\nvalues of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov line lying off the unit circle and\nout in the complex plane. This is an important issue for the lattice, and also\nfor the calculation on S^1 x S^3 in the large N limit where we obtain\nanalytical results using the saddle point approximation.

This is achieved by analysing the possible symmetries\nof such systems in terms of automorphisms of the algebra. In fact, different\nrealisations for this type of symmetry are obtained, including the natural\noccurrence of charge conjugation together with parity and time reversal. Once\nspecified the underlying anti-linear symmetry of the Hamiltonian, the former,\nif unbroken, leads to a purely real spectrum and the latter can be mapped to a\nHermitian counterpart by, amongst other possibilities, a similarity\ntransformation. Here, Lie-algebraic methods which were used to investigate the\ngeneralised Swanson Hamiltonian are employed to identify the class of quadratic\nHamiltonians that allow for such a mapping to the Hermitian counterpart.\nWhereas for the linear su(2) system every Hamiltonian of this type can be\nmapped to a Hermitian counterpart by a transformation which is itself an\nexponential of a linear combination of su(2) generators, the situation is more\ncomplicated for quadratic Hamiltonians. Therefore, the possibility of more\nelaborate similarity transformations, including quadratic exponents, is also\nexplored in detail. The existence of finite dimensional representations for the\nsu(2) Hamiltonian, as opposed to the su(1,1) studied before, allows for\ncomparison with explicit diagonalisation results for finite matrices. Finally,\nthe similarity transformations constructed are compared with the analogue of\nSwanson's method for exact diagonalsation of the problem, establishing a simple\nrelation between both approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 13:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 21:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-15"}

Based on the SDSS DR6 spectral database a search for\nthe fastest stars among hot subdwarfs (sdB) in the halo is carried out to\nidentify HVS, unbound to the Galaxy, and bound population II stars in order to\nderive a lower limit to the halo mass. The radial velocity measurements were\nverified at several telescopes to exclude radial velocity variable stars. Out\nof 88 stars observed in the follow-up campaign 39 stars were found to have\nconstant radial velocities.

The majority of\nphages contain a double-stranded DNA genome packaged in a capsid at a density\nof ~500 mg/ml. This high density requires substantial compression of the normal\nB form helix, leading to the conjecture that DNA in mature phage virions is\nunder significant pressure, and that pressure is used to eject the DNA during\ninfection. A large number of theoretical, computer simulation and in vitro\nexperimental studies surrounding this conjecture has revealed many --- though\noften isolated and/or contradictory --- aspects of packaged DNA. This prompts\nus to present a unified view of the statistical physics and thermodynamics of\nDNA packaged in phage capsids. We argue that the DNA in a mature phage is in a\n(meta)stable state, wherein electrostatic self-repulsion is balanced by\ncurvature stress due to confinement in the capsid. We show that in addition to\nthe osmotic pressure associated with the packaged DNA and its counterions,\nthere are four different pressures within the capsid: pressure on the DNA,\nhydrostatic pressure, the pressure experienced by the capsid, and the pressure\nassociated with the chemical potential of DNA ejection. Significantly, we\nanalyze the mechanism of force transmission in the packaged DNA, and\ndemonstrate that the pressure on DNA is not important for ejection. We derive\nequations showing a strong hydrostatic pressure difference across the capsid\nshell. We propose that when a phage is triggered to eject by interaction with\nits receptor in vitro, the (thermodynamic) incentive of water molecules to\nenter the phage capsid flushes the DNA out of the capsid. In vivo, the\ndifference between the osmotic pressures in the bacterial cell cytoplasm and\nthe culture medium similarly results in a water flow that drags the DNA out of\nthe capsid and into the bacterial cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 15:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

We find that for the\nedge states, the spin density lies always in the plane perpendicular to the\nribbon axis, and deviate strongly from the normal to the ribbon, even for very\nsmall curvature and the small spin orbit coupling of carbon. We find that\ncurvature results also in an effective second neighbor hopping that modifies\nthe electronic properties of zigzag graphene ribbons. We discuss the\nimplications of our finding in the spin Hall phase of curved graphene Ribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 15:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It was in outburst for about a month from September 13,\n2009. The broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermal\nComptonization with an electron temperature of kT_e ~ 25 keV, soft seed photons\nof kT_bb ~ 0.6 keV, and Thomson optical depth \\tau_T ~ 2 in a slab geometry.\nDuring the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and soft\nseed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant within\nerrors. We fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and using\nthe disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8 - 5.4)\n\\times 1010 cm. The INTEGRAL and RXTE data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a\nperiod of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~ 120 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown to\ndecrease from ~22% at 3 keV to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between\n7-30 keV, and then to decrease again down to ~13% at 60 keV. The nearly\nsinusoidal pulses show soft lags monotonically increasing with energy to about\n0.2 ms at 10-20 keV similar to those observed in other accreting pulsars. The\nshort burst profiles indicate hydrogen-poor material at ignition, which\nsuggests either that the accreted material is hydrogen-deficient, or that the\nCNO metallicity is up to a factor of 2 times solar. However, the variation of\nburst recurrence time as a function of m (inferred from the X-ray flux) is much\nsmaller than predicted by helium-ignition models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 15:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

Such pulsational masses are found to be smaller than the\nmasses derived from stellar evolution theory: this is the Cepheid mass\ndiscrepancy problem, for which a solution is missing. An independent, accurate\ndynamical mass determination for a classical Cepheid variable star (as opposed\nto type-II Cepheids, low-mass stars with a very different evolutionary history)\nin a binary system is needed in order to determine which is correct. The\naccuracy of previous efforts to establish a dynamical Cepheid mass from\nGalactic single-lined noneclipsing binaries was typically about 15-30 per cent,\nwhich is not good enough to resolve the mass discrepancy problem. In spite of\nmany observational efforts, no firm detection of a classical Cepheid in an\neclipsing double-lined binary has hitherto been reported. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a classical Cepheid in a well detached, double-lined eclipsing\nbinary in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We determine the mass to a precision of\none per cent and show that it agrees with its pulsation mass, providing strong\nevidence that pulsation theory correctly and precisely predicts the masses of\nclassical Cepheids\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 15:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}
