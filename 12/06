A novel paradigm, called\ncompressed neighbor discovery is proposed, which enables all nodes to\nsimultaneously discover their respective neighborhoods with a single frame of\ntransmission, which is typically of a few thousand symbol epochs. The key\ntechnique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature and let all nodes\nsimultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radios are\nhalf-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures\n(partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its neighbors out of a large\nnetwork address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse\nrecovery) problem.\n  Two practical schemes are studied. The first employs random on-off\nsignatures, and each node discovers its neighbors using a noncoherent detection\nalgorithm based on group testing. The second scheme uses on-off signatures\nbased on a deterministic second-order Reed-Muller code, and applies a chirp\ndecoding algorithm. The second scheme needs much lower signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) to achieve the same error performance. The complexity of the chirp\ndecoding algorithm is sub-linear, so that it is in principle scalable to\nnetworks with billions of nodes with 48-bit IEEE 802.11 MAC addresses. The\ncompressed neighbor discovery schemes are much more efficient than conventional\nrandom-access discovery, where nodes have to retransmit over many frames with\nrandom delays to be successfully discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2010 16:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2010 19:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2011 03:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 16:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We present an initial semantics result\nfor typed higher-order syntax together with its formalization in the Coq proof\nassistant. The main theorem was first proved on paper in the second author's\nPhD thesis in 2010, and verified formally shortly afterwards. To a simply-typed\nbinding signature S over a fixed set T of object types we associate a category\ncalled the category of representations of S. We show that this category has an\ninitial object Sigma(S). From its construction it will be clear that the object\nSigma(S) merits the name abstract syntax associated to S. Our theorem is\nimplemented and proved correct in the proof assistant Coq through heavy use of\ndependent types. The approach through monads gives rise to an implementation of\nsyntax where both terms and variables are intrinsically typed, i.e. where the\nobject types are reflected in the meta-level types. This article is to be seen\nas a research article rather than about the formalization of a classical\nmathematical result. The nature of our theorem - involving lengthy, technical\nproofs and complicated algebraic structures - makes it particularly interesting\nfor formal verification. Our goal is to promote the use of computer theorem\nprovers as research tools, and, accordingly, a new way of publishing\nmathematical results: a parallel description of a theorem and its formalization\nshould allow the verification of correct transcription of definitions and\nstatements into the proof assistant, and straightforward but technical proofs\nshould be well-hidden in a digital library.

The approach employs a\ndirect discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with\nadjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the\noptically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of\nthe scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of\ndirectional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of\nthese \"cone-fields\" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a\nfunction of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light\n(or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger\ntimesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer\nequation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well\nas with scattering. The method casts sharp shadows, subject to the limitations\ninduced by the adopted angular resolution. If the number of point sources is\nsmall and scattering is unimportant, our implementation can alternatively treat\neach source exactly in angular space, producing shadows whose sharpness is only\nlimited by the grid resolution. A third hybrid alternative is to treat only a\nsmall number of the locally most luminous point sources explicitly, with the\nrest of the radiation intensity followed in a radiative diffusion\napproximation.

The second question is connected to the enumeration of\nplane partitions.\n  When the field $k$ has positive characteristic, we investigate three\nquestions about the Frobenius powers $F^t(Q)$ of $Q$. When does there exist a\npair $(n,N)$ so that $Q$ has infinite projective dimension and $F(Q)$ has\nfinite projective dimension? Is the tail of the resolution of the Frobenius\npower $F^t(Q)$ eventually a periodic function of $t$, (up to shift)? In\nparticular, we exhibit a situation where the tail of the resolution of\n$F^t(Q)$, after shifting, is periodic as a function of $t$, with an arbitrarily\nlarge period. Can one use socle degrees to predict that the tail of the\nresolution of $F^t(Q)$ is a shift of the tail of the resolution of $Q$?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2010 18:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-07"}

Several new solar system\nobjects are now known to shine in X-rays at energies below 2 keV.

The advent of\nhigher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray\nobservatories has been of great benefit in advancing the field of planetary\nX-ray astronomy. Progress in modeling X-ray emission, laboratory studies of\nX-ray production, and theoretical calculations of cross-sections, have all\ncontributed to our understanding of processes that produce X-rays from the\nsolar system bodies. At Jupiter and Earth, both auroral and non-auroral disk\nX-ray emissions have been observed. X-rays have been detected from Saturn's\ndisk, but no convincing evidence of an X-ray aurora has been observed. The\nfirst soft (0.1- 2 keV) X-ray observation of Earth's aurora by Chandra shows\nthat it is highly variable. The non-auroral X-ray emissions from Jupiter,\nSaturn, and Earth, those from the disk of Mars, Venus, and Moon, and from the\nrings of Saturn, are mainly produced by scattering of solar X-rays. The\nspectral characteristics of X-ray emission from comets, the heliosphere, the\ngeocorona, and the Martian halo are quite similar, but they appear to be quite\ndifferent from those of Jovian auroral X-rays. X-rays from the Galilean\nsatellites and the IPT are mostly driven by impact of Jovian magnetospheric\nparticles.

However, the bright region of the galaxy luminosity function is\nincompatible with the simplest version of hierarchical merging, and it is\nbelieved that feedback from the central black hole in the host galaxies reduces\nthe number of bright galaxies and regulates the co-evolution of black hole and\nhost galaxy. Numerous simulations of galaxy evolution have attempted to include\nthe physical effects of such feedback with a resolution usually exceeding a\nkiloparsec. However, interactions between jets and the interstellar medium\ninvolve processes occurring on less than kiloparsec scales. In order to further\nthe understanding of processes occurring on such scales, we present a suite of\nsimulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal two-phase\ninterstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale of one\nkiloparsec. The transfer of energy and momentum to the interstellar medium is\nconsiderable, and we find that jets with powers in the range of 10^43-10^46 erg\ns^-1 can inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the\ngalaxy core. We determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of\nthe ratio of the jet power to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, the\npressure of the interstellar medium and the porosity of the dense gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 08:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The big\nadvantage of the SZ effect is its redshift independence, which is not the case\nfor visible and X-ray observations. It allows us to directly estimate the\ncluster's total mass from the integrated comptonization parameter Y, even for\ndistant clusters. However, not having a full knowing intra-cluster medium (ICM)\nphysics can affect the results. By taking self-similar temperature and density\nprofiles of the ICM into account, we studied how different ICM morphologies can\naffect the cluster total mass estimation. With the help of the high percentage\nof cool core (CC) clusters, as observed so far, the present analysis focuses on\nstudying this class of objects. A sample of eight nearby (0.1 < z < 0.5) and\nhigh-mass (M > 10^(14) M_sun) clusters observed by Chandra was considered. We\nsimulated SZ observations of these clusters through X-ray derived information\nand analyzed the mock SZ data again with the simplistic assumption of an\nisothermal beta-model profile for the ICM. The bias on the recovered cluster\ntotal mass using different sets of assumptions is estimated to be 50% higher in\nthe case of hydrostatic equilibrium. Possible contributions to the total bias\ndue to the line-of-sight integration and the considered ICM template are taken\ninto account. The large biases on total mass recovery firmly support, if still\nnecessary, cluster modeling based on more sophisticated universal profiles as\nderived by X-ray observations of local objects and hydrodynamical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 09:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2011 09:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 08:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Meanwhile, popular spectral diagnostics of AGNs\nare based on optical or ultraviolet light, making the dust obscuration as a\nprimary concern for understanding the general nature of AGNs and supermassive\nblack holes residing in them. To provide with a method of investigating\nproperties of the dusty AGNs, we derive new black hole (BH) mass estimators\nbased on velocity widths and luminosities of Near Infrared (NIR) hydrogen\nemission lines such as P$\\alpha$ and P$\\beta$, and also investigate the line\nratios of these Hydrogen lines. To derive the BH mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$)\nestimators, we used a sample of 37 unobscured Type-1 AGNs with a $M_{\\rm BH}$\nrange of $10^{6.8}$-$10^{9.4} M_{\\odot}$, where $M_{\\rm BH}$ come from either\nreverberation mapping method or single-epoch measurement method using Balmer\nlines. Our work shows that $M_{\\rm BH}$ can be estimated from the Paschen line\nluminosities and the velocity widths to the accuracy of 0.18 - 0.24 dex (rms\nscatter).

We discuss the results\nfor two different types of flaring AGN: the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279,\nin particular the coincidence of a gamma-ray flare from this source with the\ndrastic change of the optical polarization angle, and the first gamma-ray flare\nfrom a radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1, PMN J0948+0022.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 10:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 11:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-02"}

Unfortunately, the mostly used social services are centralized and\npersonal information is stored at a single vendor. This results in potential\nprivacy problems as users do not have much control over how their private data\nis disseminated. To overcome this limitation, some recent approaches envisioned\nreplacing the single authority centralization of services by a peer-to-peer\ntrust-based approach where users can decide with whom they want to share their\nprivate data. In this peer-to-peer collaboration it is very difficult to ensure\nthat after data is shared with other peers, these peers will not misbehave and\nviolate data privacy. In this paper we propose a mechanism that addresses the\nissue of data privacy violation due to data disclosure to malicious peers. In\nour approach trust values between users are adjusted according to their\nprevious activities on the shared data. Users share their private data by\nspecifying some obligations the receivers must follow. We log modifications\ndone by users on the shared data as well as the obligations that must be\nfollowed when data is shared. By a log-auditing mechanism we detect users that\nmisbehaved and we adjust their associated trust values by using any existing\ndecentralized trust model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 11:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-07"}

The gas chemical composition is\nregulated by a network of reactions that includes a large number of species\n(hydrogen and deuterium based molecules, helium, and metals).

The dust contains the standard mixture of carbonaceous grains\n(graphite grains and PAHs) and silicates of which the model follows the\nformation and destruction by several processes. The model takes into account an\naccurate treatment of the cooling process, based on several physical\nmechanisms, and cooling functions recently reported in the literature. The\nmodel is applied to a wide range of the input parameters and the results for\nimportant quantities describing the physical state of the gas and dust are\npresented. The results are organized in a database suited to the artificial\nneural networks (ANNs). Once trained, the ANNs yield the same results obtained\nby ROBO, with great accuracy.

The non-detection of the\norganic molecular lines of CH3OH (6-2-7-1 E) and CH3CN (60-50) implies that the\nwarm (~ 100 K) molecular-desorbing region heated by the central protostar is\nsmaller than ~ 100 AU towards L1521F-IRS and IRAM 04191+1522, suggesting the\nyoung age of these VeLLOs. We propose that the chemical status of surrounding\ndense gas can be used to trace the evolutionary stages of VeLLOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 14:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The success\nof sparse representation owes to the development of l1-norm optimization\ntechniques, and the fact that natural images are intrinsically sparse in some\ndomain. The image restoration quality largely depends on whether the employed\nsparse domain can represent well the underlying image. Considering that the\ncontents can vary significantly across different images or different patches in\na single image, we propose to learn various sets of bases from a pre-collected\ndataset of example image patches, and then for a given patch to be processed,\none set of bases are adaptively selected to characterize the local sparse\ndomain. We further introduce two adaptive regularization terms into the sparse\nrepresentation framework. First, a set of autoregressive (AR) models are\nlearned from the dataset of example image patches. The best fitted AR models to\na given patch are adaptively selected to regularize the image local structures.\nSecond, the image non-local self-similarity is introduced as another\nregularization term. In addition, the sparsity regularization parameter is\nadaptively estimated for better image restoration performance. Extensive\nexperiments on image deblurring and super-resolution validate that by using\nadaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization, the proposed\nmethod achieves much better results than many state-of-the-art algorithms in\nterms of both PSNR and visual perception.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 14:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

With an initially over-segmented image, in which the many\nregions (or super-pixels) with homogeneous color are detected, image\nsegmentation is performed by iteratively merging the regions according to a\nstatistical test. There are two essential issues in a region merging algorithm:\norder of merging and the stopping criterion. In the proposed algorithm, these\ntwo issues are solved by a novel predicate, which is defined by the sequential\nprobability ratio test (SPRT) and the maximum likelihood criterion. Starting\nfrom an over-segmented image, neighboring regions are progressively merged if\nthere is an evidence for merging according to this predicate. We show that the\nmerging order follows the principle of dynamic programming. This formulates\nimage segmentation as an inference problem, where the final segmentation is\nestablished based on the observed image. We also prove that the produced\nsegmentation satisfies certain global properties.

In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock\noperating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze\nthis claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative\ntheories. We show that the difference of \"Compton phases\" between the two paths\nof the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including\ngeneral relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories\nand most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the\nequivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,\nthere is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality\nof free fall. We also show that frameworks in which atom interferometers would\ntest the redshift pose serious problems, such as (i) violation of the Schiff\nconjecture, (ii) violation of the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum\nmechanics and of the principle of least action for matter waves, (iii)\nviolation of energy conservation, and more generally (iv) violation of the\nparticle-wave duality in quantum mechanics.

Three-minute\nupward-propagating acoustic shocks are thoroughly established through numerical\nsimulation as the cause of intermittent bright internetwork grains, but their\npistoning and their role in the low-chromosphere energy budget remain in\ndebate. Three-minute wave interaction with magnetic canopies is a newer\ninterest, presently progressing through numerical simulation. Three-minute\numbral flashes and running penumbral waves seem a similar acoustic-shock\nphenomenon awaiting numerical simulation. The low-frequency network Doppler\nmodulation remains enigmatic. In the second part, I address low-frequency\nultraviolet brightness variations of the internetwork chromosphere in more\ndetail. They contribute about half of the internetwork brightness modulation\nand presumably figure in cool-star basal flux.

The theoretical framework is the formalism of an oscillation of two atoms\nwith different total lepton number (and parity), one of which can be in an\nexcited state so that mass degeneracy is realized. In such a case and assuming\nlight Majorana neutrinos, the two atoms will be in a mixed configuration with\nrespect to the weak interaction. A resonant enhancement of transitions between\nsuch pairs of atoms will occur, which could be detected by the subsequent\nelectromagnetic de-excitation of the excited state of the daughter atom and\nnucleus. Available data of atomic masses, as well as nuclear and atomic\nexcitations are used to select the most likely candidates for such resonant\n$0\\nu$ECEC transitions.

The use of\ncomputational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single\nventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of\npacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the\nbiomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing\nin clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In\npractice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each\nother's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate\nthis communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease\n(CHD) the main steps involved in performing computational simulation-from the\nselection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the\ncomputational results, and all of the \"black boxes\" in between. We examine the\ncurrent state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For\nexample, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based\non numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a\nmodel with a simple \"click of a button\". The creation of a faithful,\nrepresentative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires\nskilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging\nmodality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the\ntechnical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most\ncommonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence,\nNavier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in\nrunning the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of\nboundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current\nareas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally,\nexamples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an\nopportunity to \"acquire\" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with\nessentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation\nexamples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted\npostoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented.\nThe need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted\nresults are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily\napplication of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely\nremains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both\nclinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever\nbefore and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 15:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-20"}
