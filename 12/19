Flow through such discs\nmay provide most of the mass to gas giant planets, and such discs are likely\nsites for the formation of regular satellites. We model these discs as\naccretion discs subject to the tidal forces of the central star. The tidal\ntorques from the star remove the disc angular momentum near the disc outer edge\nand permit the accreting disc gas to lose angular momentum at the rate\nappropriate for steady accretion. Circumplanetary discs are truncated near the\nradius where periodic ballistic orbits cross, where tidal forces on the disc\nare strong. This radius occurs at approximately 0.4 r_H for the planet Hill\nradius r_H. During the T Tauri stage of disc accretion, the disc is fairly\nthick with aspect ratio H/r > 0.2 and the disc edge tapering occurs over a\nradial scale ~ H ~ 0.1 r_H. For a circular or slightly eccentric orbit planet,\nno significant resonances lie within the main body of the disc. Tidally driven\nwaves involving resonances nonetheless play an important role in truncating the\ndisc, especially when it is fairly thick. We model the disc structure using one\ndimensional time-dependent and steady-state models and also two dimensional SPH\nsimulations. The circumplanetary disc structure depends on the variation of the\ndisc turbulent viscosity with radius and is insensitive to the angular\ndistribution of the accreting gas. Dead zones may occur within the\ncircumplanetary disc and result in density structures. If the disc is turbulent\nthroughout, the predicted disc structure near the location of the regular\nJovian and Saturnian satellites is smooth with no obvious feature that would\nfavor formation at their current locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2010 16:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This introduces differences in plasma physics processes in\nthose media relative to the solar corona and the solar wind at a heliocentric\ndistance of 1 astronomical unit. In this paper, we consider two well-diagnosed,\npartially-ionized interstellar plasmas. The first is the Diffuse Ionized Gas\n(DIG) which is probably the extensive phase in terms of volume. The second is\nthe gas that makes up the Local Clouds of the Very Local Interstellar Medium\n(VLISM). Ion-neutral interactions seem to be important in both media. In the\nDIG, ion-neutral collisions are relatively rare, but sufficiently frequent to\ndamp magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves (as well as propagating MHD eddies) within\nless than a parsec of the site of generation. This result raises interesting\nquestions about the sources of turbulence in the DIG. In the case of the VLISM,\nthe ion-neutral collision frequency is higher than that in the DIG, because the\nhydrogen is partially neutral rather than fully ionized. We present results\nshowing that prominent features of coronal and solar wind turbulence seem to be\nabsent in VLISM turbulence. For example, ion temperature does not depend on ion\nmass. This difference may be attributable to ion-neutral collisions, which\ndistribute power from more effectively heated massive ions such as iron to\nother ion species and neutral atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2010 21:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Various optimal SVQs have been obtained, both\nanalytically and numerically. Analytic solutions which demonstrate how the\ninput space is split into independent subspaces may be obtained when an SVQ is\nused to encode data that lives on a 2-torus (e.g. the superposition of a pair\nof uncorrelated sinusoids). Many numerical solutions have also been obtained,\nusing both SVQs and chains of linked SVQs: (1) images of multiple independent\ntargets (encoders for single targets emerge), (2) images of multiple correlated\ntargets (various types of encoder for single and multiple targets emerge), (3)\nsuperpositions of various waveforms (encoders for the separate waveforms emerge\n- this is a type of independent component analysis (ICA)), (4) maternal and\nfoetal ECGs (another example of ICA), (5) images of textures (orientation maps\nand dominance stripes emerge).

In the absence of external sources this is nothing but the\nvacuum energy density. The key element of this derivation is the introduction\nof a temperature dependence into the expression for the bag constant. The\nnon-perturbative part of the analytical equation of state does not depend on\nthe coupling constant, but instead introduces a dependence on the mass gap.\nThis is responsible for the large-scale dynamical structure of the QCD ground\nstate. The perturbative part of the analytical equation of state does depend on\nthe QCD fine-structure coupling constant $\\alpha_s$. Here we develop the\nanalytical formalism, incorporating the perturbative part in a self-consistent\nway. It makes it possible to calculate the PT contributions to the equation of\nstate in terms of the convergent series in integer powers of a small\n$\\alpha_s$. We also explicitly derive and numerically calculate the first\nperturbative contribution of the $\\alpha_s$-order to the non-perturbative part\nof the equation of state derived and calculated previously. The analytical\nequation of state or, equivalently, the gluon pressure is exponentially\nsuppressed at low temperatures, while at temperature $T=T_c = 266.5 \\ \\MeV$ it\nhas a maximum, if divided by $T^4/3$.
