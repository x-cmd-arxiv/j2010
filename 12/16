This paper\naddresses the issues of defining such sequent calculi for Pure Type Systems\n(PTS, which were originally presented in natural deduction style) and then\norganizing their rules for effective proof-search. We introduce the idea of\nPure Type Sequent Calculus with meta-variables (PTSCalpha), by enriching the\nsyntax of a permutation-free sequent calculus for propositional logic due to\nHerbelin, which is strongly related to natural deduction and already well\nadapted to proof-search. The operational semantics is adapted from Herbelin's\nand is defined by a system of local rewrite rules as in cut-elimination, using\nexplicit substitutions. We prove confluence for this system. Restricting our\nattention to PTSC, a type system for the ground terms of this system, we obtain\nthe Subject Reduction property and show that each PTSC is logically equivalent\nto its corresponding PTS, and the former is strongly normalising iff the latter\nis. We show how to make the logical rules of PTSC into a syntax-directed system\nPS for proof-search, by incorporating the conversion rules as in\nsyntax-directed presentations of the PTS rules for type-checking. Finally, we\nconsider how to use the explicitly scoped meta-variables of PTSCalpha to\nrepresent partial proof-terms, and use them to analyse interactive proof\nconstruction. This sets up a framework PE in which we are able to study\nproof-search strategies, type inhabitant enumeration and (higher-order)\nunification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 16:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 08:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The Crab nebula displayed a large gamma-ray flare on September 18,\n2010. To more closely understand the origin of this phenomenon, we analyze the\nINTEGRAL (20-500 keV) and FERMI (0.1-300 GeV) data collected almost\nsimultaneously during the flare. Methods. We divide the available data into\nthree different sets, corresponding to the pre-flare period, the flare, and the\nsubsequent quiescence. For each period, we perform timing and spectral analyses\nto differentiate between the contributions of the pulsar and from the\nsurrounding nebula to the gamma-ray luminosity. Results. No significant\nvariations in the pulse profile and spectral characteristics are detected in\nthe hard X-ray domain. In contrast, we identify three separate enhancements in\nthe gamma-ray flux lasting for about 12 hours and separated by an interval of\nabout two days from each other. The spectral analysis shows that the flux\nenhancement, confined below ~ 1 GeV, can be modelled by a power-law with a high\nenergy exponential cut-off, where either the cut-off energy or the model\nnormalization increased by a factor of ~ 5 relative to the pre-flare emission.\nWe also confirm that the gamma-ray flare is not pulsed. Conclusions. The timing\nand spectral analysis indicate that the gamma-ray flare is due to synchrotron\nemission from a very compact Pevatron located in the region of interaction\nbetween the pulsar wind and the surrounding nebula. These are the highest\nelectron energies ever measured in a cosmic accelerator.

Inhere I\nmainly discuss the common physical and mathematical features of several exactly\nsolvable statistical models which describe the nuclear liquid-gas phase\ntransition and the deconfinement phase transition. Luckily, in some cases it\nwas possible to rigorously extend the solutions found in thermodynamic limit to\nfinite volumes and to formulate the finite volume analogs of phases directly\nfrom the grand canonical partition. It turns out that finite volume (surface)\nof a system generates also the temporal constraints, i.e. the finite\nformation/decay time of possible states in this finite system. Among other\nresults I would like to mention the calculation of upper and lower bounds for\nthe surface entropy of physical clusters within the Hills and Dales model;\nevaluation of the second virial coefficient which accounts for the Lorentz\ncontraction of the hard core repulsing potential between hadrons; inclusion of\nlarge width of heavy quark-gluon bags into statistical description.

By\nartificially varying the atomic number of Mn we investigate how the magnetic\nground state is influenced by alloying the Mn chains with Fe and Cr. With\nincreasing number of 3d-electrons we find a smooth transition in the magnetic\nphase space starting from an antiferromagnetic state for pure Cr chains through\na regime of non-collinear ground states for Mn-rich chains to a ferromagnetic\nsolution approaching the limit of pure Fe chains.

An accurate\nknowledge of the spectral resolution of these libraries is critical to avoid\npropagation errors and uncertain estimates of the intrinsic stellar velocity\ndispersion of galaxies. In this research note we re-assess the spectral\nresolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models\nbased on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over\nthe exact MILES resolution. We perform our test through the comparison of MILES\nstellar spectra with three different sets of higher-resolution templates, one\nfully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the\nIndo-U.S. and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a\nwell-defined very high (R=20000) resolution. Hence errors on this theoretical\nvalue do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library\nwas crucial to constrain the values of the resolution also for the other two\nempirical templates. We find that the MILES resolution has previously been\nslightly overestimated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 A FWHM,\ninstead of the nominal 2.3 A. The reason for this difference is due to an\noverestimation of the resolution for the Indo-U.S. library that was previously\nused for estimates of the MILES resolution. For the Indo-U.S. we obtain a new\nvalue of 1.35 A FWHM. Most importantly, the results derived from the MARCS and\nELODIE libraries are in very good agreement. These results are important for\nusers of the MILES spectra library and for further development of stellar\npopulation models aimed to obtain accurate stellar kinematics in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 19:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In the final section NVU dynamics is compared\nto Monte Carlo dynamics, to a diffusive dynamics of small-step random walks on\nthe constant-potential-energy hypersurface, and to Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics.

The set of equations adequate for\nlarge drops is not satisfactory for medium-size drops (10 \\leq ri \\leq 100\n{\\mu}m), and vice versa. In the case of large particles, the increase in the\ninterfacial area as a consequence of the deformation of the drops generates a\nvery large repulsive barrier which opposes coalescence. Nevertheless, the\nbuoyancy force prevails. As a consequence, it is the hydrodynamic tensor of the\ndrops which determine the characteristic behavior of the lifetime as a function\nof the particle size. While the average values of the coalescence time of the\ndrops can be justified by the mechanism of film thinning, the scattering of the\nexperimental data of large drops cannot be rationalized using the methodology\npreviously described.

A user can be a human, sitting\nin front of a desktop machine, or it can be another machine sending a request\nto a server through a network connection. We think that OS should become\nintelligent to distinguish between different processes and allocate resources,\nincluding CPU, to those processes which need them most. In this work, as a\nfirst step to make the OS aware of the current state of the system, we consider\nprocess dependencies and interprocess communications.

We explore the conditions\nfor disc fragmentation and we find that they are satisfied when a disc is large\nenough (>100 AU) so that its outer regions can cool efficiently, and it has\nenough mass to be gravitationally unstable, at such radii. We perform radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations and show that even a disc with mass 0.25 Msun and size\n100 AU fragments. The disc mass, radius, and the ratio of disc-to-star mass\n(Mdisc/Mstar~0.36) are smaller than in previous studies. We find that\nfragmenting discs decrease in mass and size within a few 10^4 yr of their\nformation, since a fraction of their mass, especially outside 100 AU is\nconsumed by the new stars and brown dwarfs that form. Fragmenting discs end up\nwith masses ~0.001-0.1 Msun, and sizes ~20-100 AU. On the other hand, discs\nthat are marginally stable live much longer. We produce simulated images of\nfragmenting discs and find that observing discs that are undergoing\nfragmentation is possible using current (e.g. IRAM-PdBI) and future (e.g. ALMA)\ninterferometers, but highly improbable due to the short duration of this\nprocess. Comparison with observations shows that many observed discs may be\nremnants of discs that have fragmented at an earlier stage. However, there are\nonly a few candidates that are possibly massive and large enough to currently\nbe gravitationally unstable. The rarity of massive (>0.2 Msun), extended (>100\nAU) discs indicates either that such discs are highly transient (i.e. form,\nincrease in mass becoming gravitationally unstable due to infall of material\nfrom the surrounding envelope, and quickly fragment), or that their formation\nis suppressed (e.g. by magnetic fields). We conclude that current observations\nof early-stage discs cannot exclude the mechanism of disc fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 11:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The orbital selectivity of the NEXAFS resonances allows\nto precisely elucidate the participation of specific orbitals in the\ncharge-transfer process. In the present case charge is transferred from\nmethoxy-orbitals 2e (PI*) and 6a1 (SIGMA*) to the cyano-orbitals b3g and au\n(PI*) and - to a weaker extent - to b1g and b2u (SIGMA*).

The innermost planet may\ngradually become very eccentric and/or inclined, as a result of the secular\ndegrees of freedom drifting towards equipartition of angular momentum deficit.\nSecular chaos is known to be responsible for the eventual destabilization of\nMercury in our own Solar System. Here we focus on systems with three giant\nplanets. We characterize the secular chaos and demonstrate the criterion for it\nto occur, but leave a detailed understanding of secular chaos to a companion\npaper (Lithwick & Wu, 2010). After an extended period of eccentricity\ndiffusion, the inner planet's pericentre can approach the star to within a few\nstellar radii. Strong tidal interactions and ensuing tidal dissipation extracts\norbital energy from the planet and pulls it inward, creating a hot Jupiter. In\ncontrast to other proposed channels for the production of hot Jupiters, such a\nscenario (which we term \"secular migration\") explains a range of observations:\nthe pile-up of hot Jupiters at 3-day orbital periods, the fact that hot\nJupiters are in general less massive than other RV planets, that they may have\nmisaligned inclinations with respect to stellar spin, and that they have few\neasily detectable companions (but may have giant companions in distant orbits).\nSecular migration can also explain close-in planets as low in mass as Neptune;\nand an aborted secular migration can explain the \"warm Jupiters\" at\nintermediate distances. In addition, the frequency of hot Jupiters formed via\nsecular migration increases with stellar age. We further suggest that secular\nchaos may be responsible for the observed eccentricities of giant planets at\nlarger distances, and that these planets could exhibit significant spin-orbit\nmisalignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2010 21:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We show that the\nmajority of information about dark energy physics contained in the shear power\ncomes from these small-scales; removing these nonlinear scales from a cosmic\nshear analysis results in a 50% cut in the accuracy of measurements of dark\nenergy parameters, marginalizing over all other parameters. In this paper we\npropose a method to recover the information on small-scales by allowing cosmic\nshear surveys to measure the nonlinear matter power spectrum themselves and\nmarginalize over all possible power spectra using path integrals. Information\nis still recoverable in these nonlinear regimes from the geometric part of weak\nlensing. In this self-calibration regime we find we recover 90% of the\ninformation on dark energy. Including an informative prior, we find the\nnonlinear matter power spectrum needs to be accurately known to 1% down to k=50\nh/Mpc to recover 99% of the dark energy information.

In this\nmodel, the two valence neutrons move in a one-dimensional mean field,\ninteracting with each other via a density-dependent contact interaction. We\nfirst investigate the ground state properties, and demonstrate that the\ndineutron correlation can be realized with this simple model due to the\nadmixture of even- and odd-parity single-particle states. We then solve the\ntime-dependent two-particle Schr\\\"odinger equation under the influence of a\ntime-dependent one-body external field, in order to discuss the effect of\ndineutron correlation on nuclear breakup processes. The time evolution of\ntwo-particle density shows that the dineutron correlation enhances the total\nbreakup probability, especially for the two-neutron breakup process, in which\nboth the valence neutrons are promoted to continuum scattering states. We find\nthat the interaction between the two particles definitely favours a spatial\ncorrelation of the two outgoing particles, which are mainly emitted in the same\ndirection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 01:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We detect variability between 5-38 microns in all but two of our objects\non timescales of 2-3 years. Most of the variability observed can be classified\nas seesaw behavior, whereby the emission at shorter wavelengths varies\ninversely with the emission at longer wavelengths. For many of the objects we\ncan reasonably reproduce the observed variability using irradiated disk models,\nparticularly by changing the height of the inner disk wall by ~20%. When the\ninner wall is taller, the emission at the shorter wavelengths is higher since\nthe inner wall dominates the emission at 2-8 microns. The taller inner wall\ncasts a larger shadow on the outer disk wall, leading to less emission at\nwavelengths beyond 20 microns where the outer wall dominates. We discuss how\nthe possible presence of planets in these disks could lead to warps which cause\nchanges in the height of the inner wall. We also find that crystalline\nsilicates are common in the outer disks of our objects and that in the four\ndisks in the sample with the most crystalline silicates, variability on\ntimescales of 1 week is present. In addition to explaining the infrared\nvariability described above, planets can create shocks and collisions which can\ncrystallize the dust and lead to short timescale variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 02:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The solution demonstrates the\n\"self-consistency\" procedure of Wheatland & Regnier (2009), for the first time\nincluding uncertainties. The self-consistency procedure addresses the problem\nthat photospheric vector magnetogram data are inconsistent with the force-free\nmodel, and in particular that the boundary conditions on vertical electric\ncurrent density are over-specified and permit the construction of two different\nnonlinear force-free solutions. The procedure modifies the boundary conditions\non current density during a sequence of cycles until the two nonlinear\nforce-free solutions agree. It hence constructs an accurate single solution to\nthe force-free model, with boundary values close, but not matched exactly, to\nthe vector magnetogram data. The inclusion of uncertainties preserves the\nboundary conditions more closely at points with smaller uncertainties. The\nself-consistent solution obtained for active region AR 10953 is significantly\nnon-potential, with magnetic energy E/E_0 = 1.08, where E_0 is the energy of\nthe reference potential (current-free) magnetic field. The self-consistent\nsolution is shown to be robust against changes in the details of the\nconstruction of the two force-free models at each cycle.

Much recent effort has been devoted to the question of\nobtaining necessary and sufficient conditions for these Gowers norms to have\nnon-trivial size (e.g. at least $\\eta$ for some small $\\eta > 0$), leading in\nparticular to the inverse conjecture for the Gowers norms, and to the Host-Kra\nclassification of characteristic factors for the Gowers-Host-Kra seminorms.\n  In this paper we investigate the near-extremal (or \"property testing\")\nversion of this question, when the Gowers norm or Gowers-Host-Kra seminorm of a\nfunction is almost as large as it can be subject to an $L^\\infty$ or $L^p$\nbound on its magnitude.

This paper examines what can be learnt from current\nand future photometric-databases using group-finding techniques. We compare\ngroups recovered from a sample of M-giants from 2MASS with those found in\nsynthetic surveys of simulated $\\Lambda$CDM stellar halos and demonstrate broad\nconsistency. We also find that these recovered groups are likely to represent\nthe majority of high-luminosity ($\\log(L/L_{Sun})>6.67$) satellites accreted\nwithin the last 10 Gyr and on orbits with apocenters within 100 kpc. However\nthe sensitivity of the M-giant survey to accretion events that were either\nancient, from low-luminosity objects or those on radial orbits is limited\nbecause of the low number of stars, bias towards high-metallicity stars and the\nshallow depth. We examine the extent to which these limitations are addressed\nby current and future surveys, in particular catalogues of main-sequence\nturn-off (MSTO) stars from SDSS and LSST, and of RR-Lyrae stars from LSST or\nPanSTARRS. The MSTO surveys are more sensitive to low-luminosity events\n($\\log(L/L_{Sun}~5$ or less) than the 2MASS M-giant sample, while the RR-Lyrae\nsurveys, with superior depth, are good at detecting events on highly eccentric\norbits. When combined we expect these photometric surveys to provide a\ncomprehensive picture of the last 10 Gyr of Galactic accretion. Events older\nthan this are too phase mixed to be discovered and would require additional\ninformation such as velocity and chemical abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 05:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We\nuse the Coles & Harmon model for the inner scale $l_{i}(R)$, that is presumed\nto arise from cyclotron damping.

We find that\nthe inclusion of spherical divergence effects suppresses the predicted source\nsize substantially. We also find that inner scale effects significantly reduce\nthe predicted source size. An important general finding for solar sources is\nthat the calculations substantially underpredict the observed source size.\nThree possible, non-exclusive, interpretations of this general result are\nproposed. First and simplest, future observations with better angular\nresolution will detect much smaller sources. Consistent with this, previous\nobservations of small sources in the corona at metric wavelengths are limited\nby the instrument resolution. Second, the spatially-varying level of turbulence\n$C_{N}^{2}(R)$ is much larger in the inner corona than predicted by\nstraightforward extrapolation Sunwards of the empirical prescription, which was\nbased on observations between 10--50 $R_{\\odot}$.

Then, Euler-Lagrange equation for Universe scale factor is\nequivalent to the second Friedman equation for the flat empty space with\ncosmological constant (in this sense our model is full agreement with recent\nastronomical observations). Also there is Euler-Lagrange equation for scalar\nfield that includes additional \"friction\" term and negative first partial\nderivative of unknown potential energy density (this equation is, in some way,\nsimilar to Klein-Gordon equation modified for cosmic expansion in Linde chaotic\ninflation scenario). Finally, total time derivative of the (constant) scalar\nfield total energy density must be zero. It implies third dynamical equation\nwhich is equivalent to usual Euler-Lagrange equation with positive partial\nderivative of unknown potential energy density (this equation is formally\nexactly equivalent to corresponding equation in static Universe). Last two\nequations admit simple exact determination of scalar field and potential energy\ndensity, while cosmological constant stands a \"free parameter\". Potential\nenergy density represents a square function of scalar field with unique maximum\n(dynamically non-stable point).

Examples include populations which are geographically separated,\ncase--control studies and quality control (when participants in a study have\nbeen genotyped at different laboratories). This latter application is of\nparticular importance in the era of large scale genome wide association\nstudies, when collections of individuals genotyped at different locations are\nbeing merged to provide increased power. The traditional method for detecting\nstructure within a population is some form of exploratory technique such as\nprincipal components analysis. Such methods, which do not utilise our prior\nknowledge of the membership of the candidate populations. are termed\n\\emph{unsupervised}. Supervised methods, on the other hand are able to utilise\nthis prior knowledge when it is available.\n  In this paper we demonstrate that in such cases modern supervised approaches\nare a more appropriate tool for detecting genetic differences between\npopulations. We apply two such methods, (neural networks and support vector\nmachines) to the classification of three populations (two from Scotland and one\nfrom Bulgaria). The sensitivity exhibited by both these methods is considerably\nhigher than that attained by principal components analysis and in fact\ncomfortably exceeds a recently conjectured theoretical limit on the sensitivity\nof unsupervised methods. In particular, our methods can distinguish between the\ntwo Scottish populations, where principal components analysis cannot. We\nsuggest, on the basis of our results that a supervised learning approach should\nbe the method of choice when classifying individuals into pre-defined\npopulations, particularly in quality control for large scale genome wide\nassociation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 10:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A coupled state of an electromagnetic field with an\nelectric or magnetic dipole-carrying excitation is well known as a polariton.\nSuch a state is the result of the mixing of a photon with an excitation of a\nmaterial. The most discussed types of polaritons are phonon-polaritons,\nexciton-polaritons, and surface plasmon-polaritons.

If the metal is also a superconductor then, at low temperatures,\ndisorder can induce a dramatic transition from a superconducting into an\ninsulating state. An outstanding question is whether the route to insulating\nbehavior proceeds via the direct localization of Cooper pairs or,\nalternatively, by a two-step process in which the Cooper pairing is first\ndestroyed followed by the standard localization of single electrons. Here we\naddress this question by studying the local superconducting gap of a highly\ndisordered, amorphous, superconductor by means of scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy. Our measurements reveal that, in the vicinity of the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition, the coherence peaks in the one-particle\ndensity of states disappear while the superconducting gap remains intact\nindicating the presence of localized Cooper pairs. Our results provide the\nfirst direct evidence that the transition in our system is driven by Cooper\npair localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 15:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-07"}

Using the MIPS camera and the IRS spectrograph we\nsearched for debris dust around 82 F-type stars with Spitzer. We found 27 stars\nthat harbor debris disks, nine of which are new discoveries. The dust\ndistribution around two of our stars, HD 50571 and HD 170773, was found to be\nmarginally extended on the 70um MIPS images. Combining the MIPS and IRS\nmeasurements with additional infrared and submillimeter data, we achieved\nexcellent spectral coverage for most of our debris systems. We have modeled the\nexcess emission of 22 debris disks using a single temperature dust ring model\nand of 5 debris systems with two-temperature models. The latter systems may\ncontain two dust rings around the star. In accordance with the expected trends,\nthe fractional luminosity of the disks declines with time, exhibiting a decay\nrate consistent with the range of model predictions. We found the distribution\nof radial dust distances as a function of age to be consistent with the\npredictions of both the self stirred and the planetary stirred disk evolution\nmodels. A more comprehensive investigation of the evolution of debris disks\naround F-type stars, partly based on the presented data set, will be the\nsubject of an upcoming paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 15:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However, these structural motifs can only tell one part of the\nfunctional story because in this analysis each node and edge is treated on an\nequal footing. In real networks, two motifs that are topologically identical\nbut whose nodes perform very different functions will play very different roles\nin the network. Here, we combine structural information derived from the\ntopology of the neuronal network of the nematode C. elegans with information\nabout the biological function of these nodes, thus coloring nodes by function.\nWe discover that particular colorations of motifs are significantly more\nabundant in the worm brain than expected by chance, and have particular\ncomputational functions that emphasize the feed-forward structure of\ninformation processing in the network, while evading feedback loops.\nInterneurons are strongly over-represented among the common motifs, supporting\nthe notion that these motifs process and transduce the information from the\nsensor neurons towards the muscles. Some of the most common motifs identified\nin the search for significant colored motifs play a crucial role in the system\nof neurons controlling the worm's locomotion. The analysis of complex networks\nin terms of colored motifs combines two independent data sets to generate\ninsight about these networks that cannot be obtained with either data set\nalone. The method is general and should allow a decomposition of any complex\nnetwork into its functional (rather than topological) motifs as long as both\nwiring and functional information is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 15:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However,\ndirect detections of these magnetic fields using optical spectropolarimetry\nhave proven to be very difficult. Aims: Non-thermal radio emission in these\nobjects would most likely be due to synchrotron radiation. As a magnetic field\nis required for the production of synchrotron radiation, this would be strong\nevidence for the presence of a magnetic field. Such non-thermal emission has\nalready been observed from the strongly magnetic Ap/Bp stars. Methods: We have\nperformed 6 & 21 cm observations using the WSRT and use these, in combination\nwith archival VLA data at 3.6 cm and results from the literature, to study the\nradio emission of 5 selected candidate magnetic O stars. Results: Out of our\nfive targets, we have detected three: $\\xi$ Per, which shows a non-thermal\nradio spectrum, and $\\alpha$ Cam and $\\lambda$ Cep, which show no evidence of a\nnon-thermal spectrum. In general we find that the observed free-free (thermal)\nflux of the stellar wind is lower than expected. This is in agreement with\nrecent findings that the mass-loss rates from O stars as derived from the\nH$\\alpha$ line are overestimated because of clumping in the inner part of the\nstellar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 15:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

Such massive stars\n(~150-300 M) may end their life as pair-instability supernovae (PISN) if they\nretain enough mass until they die. We have calculated a grid of stellar\nevolution models in order to investigate the impact of mass loss and rotation\non the evolution and fate of these very massive stars. As mass loss is very\nstrong at solar metallicity, our models predict that most of the very massive\nstars will die as type Ic SNe. Only slowly and non-rotating stars at\nmetallicities below that of the LMC might retain enough mass to produce a PISN.\nThis would mean that the first stellar generations might have produced PISN\nalthough their chemical signature is not observed in extremely metal poor stars\nin the halo of our galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

The principles in TVS is to find the minimum on a\nFowler-Nordheim plot where $\\ln(I/V^2)$ is plotted against $1/V$ and relate the\nvoltage at the minimum, $V_{\\rm min}$, to the closest molecular level.\nImportantly, $V_{\\rm min}$, is approximately half the voltage required to see a\npeak in the $dI/dV$ curve. Information about the molecular level position can\nthus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show that the\nmolecular level position can be determined at even lower voltages, $V_{\\rm\nmin}^{(\\alpha)}$ by finding the minimum of $\\ln(I/V^\\alpha)$ with $\\alpha<2$.\nOn the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we analyze theoretical\n{\\it ab initio} as well as experimental $I-V$ curves and show that the voltage\nrequired to determine the molecular levels can be reduced by $\\sim 30%$ as\ncompared to conventional TVS. As for conventional TVS, the symmetry/asymmetry\nof the molecular junction needs to be taken into account in order to gain\nquantitative information. We show that the degree of asymmetry may be estimated\nfrom a plot of $V_{\\rm min}^{(\\alpha)}$ vs. $\\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
