A faithful modeling of the dynamics is\nessential because different dynamical processes may be affected very\ndifferently by network topology. A full characterization of such systems thus\nrequires a formalization that encompasses both aspects simultaneously, rather\nthan relying only on the topological adjacency matrix. To achieve this, we\nintroduce the concept of flow graphs, namely weighted networks where dynamical\nflows are embedded into the link weights. Flow graphs provide an integrated\nrepresentation of the structure and dynamics of the system, which can then be\nanalyzed with standard tools from network theory. Conversely, a structural\nnetwork feature of our choice can also be used as the basis for the\nconstruction of a flow graph that will then encompass a dynamics biased by such\na feature. We illustrate the ideas by focusing on the mathematical properties\nof generic linear processes on complex networks that can be represented as\nbiased random walks and also explore their dual consensus dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However, while it is easy to write down toy theories allowing\narbitrary nonlocal correlations, those allowed in quantum mechanics are\nlimited. Quantum correlations cannot, for example, violate a principle known as\nmacroscopic locality, which implies that they cannot violate Tsirelson's bound.\nThis work shows that there is a connection between the strength of nonlocal\ncorrelations in a physical theory, and the structure of the state spaces of\nindividual systems. This is illustrated by a family of models in which local\nstate spaces are regular polygons, where a natural analogue of a maximally\nentangled state of two systems exists. We characterize the nonlocal\ncorrelations obtainable from such states. The family allows us to study the\ntransition between classical, quantum, and super-quantum correlations, by\nvarying only the local state space. We show that the strength of nonlocal\ncorrelations - in particular whether the maximally entangled state violates\nTsirelson's bound or not - depends crucially on a simple geometric property of\nthe local state space, known as strong self-duality. This result is seen to be\na special case of a general theorem, which states that a broad class of\nentangled states in probabilistic theories - including, by extension, all\nbipartite classical and quantum states - cannot violate macroscopic locality.\nFinally, our results show that there exist models which are locally almost\nindistinguishable from quantum mechanics, but can nevertheless generate\nmaximally nonlocal correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 16:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:50:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 16:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The answer to this question crucially depends on the\nmechanism of mass generation in QCD and interconnection of confinement and\nchiral symmetry breaking.

Almost systematical parity doubling of\nhighly excited hadrons suggests that their mass is not related to chiral\nsymmetry breaking in the vacuum and is approximately chirally symmetric. Then\nthere is a possibility for existence of confining but chirally symmetric\nmatter. We clarify a possible mechanism underlying such a phase at low\ntemperatures and large density. Namely, at large density the Pauli blocking\nprevents the gap equation to generate a solution with broken chiral symmetry.\nHowever, the chirally symmetric part of the quark Green function as well as all\ncolor non-singlet quantities are still infrared divergent, meaning that the\nsystem is with confinement.

While\nSpeckle Stabilization was initially conceived for integral field spectroscopic\nanalyses, the technique shares many similarities with speckle imaging\n(specifically shift-and-add and Lucky Imaging). Therefore, it is worth\ncomparing the two for imaging applications. We have modeled observations on a\n2.5-meter class telescope to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the two\ntechniques. While the differences are relatively minor, we find that Speckle\nStabilization is a viable competitor to current Lucky Imaging systems.\nSpecifically, we find that Speckle Stabilization is 3.35 times more efficient\n(where efficiency is defined as signal-to-noise per observing interval) than\nshift-and-add and able to detect targets 1.42 magnitudes fainter when using a\nstandard system.

We present a relation between C, F, P, and Kr abundances among PNe\nand C-rich stars. The detections of F and Kr support the idea that F and Kr\ntogether with C are synthesized in the same layer and brought to the surface by\nthe third dredge-up. We have estimated the N^2+ and O^2+ abundances using\noptical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs). The\ndiscrepancy between the abundance derived from the O ORL and that derived from\nthe O CEL is >1 dex. To investigate the status of the central star of the PN,\nnebula condition, and dust properties, we construct a theoretical SED model\nwith CLOUDY. By comparing the derived luminosity and temperature of the central\nstar with theoretical evolutionary tracks, we conclude that the initial mass of\nthe progenitor is likely to be ~1.5-2.0 Msun and the age is ~3000 yr after the\nAGB phase. The observed elemental abundances can be explained by a theoretical\nnucleosynthesis model with a star of initial mass 2.25 Msun, Z=0.008 and LMC\ncompositions. We have estimated the dust mass to be 2.9x10^-4 Msun (amorphous\ncarbon only) or 4.0x10^-4 Msun (amorphous carbon and PAH). Based on the\nassumption that most of the observed dust is formed during the last two thermal\npulses and the dust-to-gas mass ratio is 5.58x10^-3, the dust mass-loss rate\nand the total mass-loss rate are <3.1x10^-8 Msun / yr and <5.5x10^-6 Msun / yr,\nrespectively. Our estimated dust mass-loss rate is comparable to a Sgr dwarf\ngalaxy AGB star with similar metallicity and luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 17:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This technique is applied to networks with power-law node\nintensities, which includes homogeneous networks as a special case, to find a\nsimple approximation for the spectral efficiency. It is found that for\nreceivers in dense clusters, the SINR grows with N at rates higher than that of\nhomogeneous networks and that constant spectral efficiencies can be maintained\nif the ratio of N to node density is constant. This result also enables the\nanalysis of a new scaling regime where the distribution of nodes in the network\nflattens rather than increases uniformly.

The data are\nexamined to extract precise isotopologic ratios of 12CN/13CN and 12CH+/13CH+ in\norder to assess predictions of diffuse cloud chemistry. Our results on\n12CH+/13CH+ confirm that this ratio does not deviate from the ambient 12C/13C\nratio in local interstellar clouds, as expected if the formation of CH+\ninvolves nonthermal processes. We find that 12CN/13CN, however, can be\nsignificantly fractionated away from the ambient value. The dispersion in our\nsample of 12CN/13CN ratios is similar to that found in recent surveys of\n12CO/13CO. For sight lines where both ratios have been determined, the\n12CN/13CN ratios are generally fractionated in the opposite sense compared to\n12CO/13CO. Chemical fractionation in CO results from competition between\nselective photodissociation and isotopic charge exchange. An inverse\nrelationship between 12CN/13CN and 12CO/13CO follows from the coexistence of CN\nand CO in diffuse cloud cores. However, an isotopic charge exchange reaction\nwith CN may mitigate the enhancements in 12CN/13CN for lines of sight with low\n12CO/13CO ratios. For two sight lines with high values of 12CO/13CO, our\nresults indicate that about 50 percent of the carbon is locked up in CO, which\nis consistent with the notion that these sight lines probe molecular cloud\nenvelopes where the transition from C+ to CO is expected to occur.

The discovery of nonthermal X-ray\nemission from supernova remnants is now 30 years old, and its interpretation as\nthe extension of the radio synchrotron spectrum requires electrons with\nenergies of up to 100 TeV. SNRs are now detected at GeV and TeV photon energies\nas well. Strong suggestions of the presence of energetic ions exist, but\nconclusive evidence remains elusive. Several arguments suggest that magnetic\nfields in SNRs are amplified by orders of magnitude from their values in the\nambient interstellar medium.

The precise photometric redshifts and stellar masses that the NMBS\nproduces allows us to define a series of mass limited samples of galaxies more\nmassive than 0.7, 1 and 3x10^10 Msun in redshift intervals centered on z = 1.1,\n1.5 and 1.9 respectively. In each redshift interval we show that there exists a\nstrong dependence of clustering strength on the stellar mass limit of the\nsample, with more massive galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude on all\nscales. We further interpret our clustering measurements in the LCDM\ncosmological context using the halo model of galaxy clustering. We show that\nthe typical halo mass of central and satellite galaxies increases with stellar\nmass, whereas the satellite fraction decreases with stellar mass, qualitatively\nthe same as is seen at z < 1. We see little evidence of any redshift dependence\nin the stellar mass-to-halo mass relationship over our narrow redshift range.\nHowever, when we compare with similar measurements at z~0, we see clear\nevidence for a change in this relation. If we assume a universal baryon\nfraction, the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass reveals the fraction of\nbaryons that have been converted to stars. We see that the peak in this star\nformation efficiency for central galaxies shifts to higher halo masses at\nhigher redshift, moving from ~7x10^11 Msun at z~0 to ~3x10^12 Msun at z~1.5,\nrevealing evidence of `halo downsizing'. Finally we show that for highly biased\ngalaxy populations at z > 1 there may be a discrepancy between the measured\nspace density and clustering and that predicted by the halo model.

We investigate tidally-triggered star\nformation in isolated close galaxy pairs drawn from the Prism Multi-Object\nSurvey (PRIMUS), a low-dispersion prism redshift survey that has measured\n~120,000 robust galaxy redshifts over 9.1 deg^2 out to z ~ 1. We select a\nsample of galaxies in isolated galaxy pairs at redshifts 0.25 < z < 0.75, with\nno other objects within a projected separation of 300 h^-1 kpc and dz/(1+z) =\n0.01, and compare them to a control sample of isolated galaxies to test for\nsystematic differences in their rest-frame FUV-r and NUV-r colors as a proxy\nfor relative specific SFR. We find that galaxies in r_p < 50 h^-1 kpc pairs\nhave bluer dust-corrected UV-r colors on average than the control galaxies by\n-0.134 +/- 0.045 magnitudes in FUV-r and -0.075 +/- 0.038 magnitudes in NUV-r,\ncorresponding to a ~15-20% increase in SSFR. This indicates an enhancement in\nSSFR due to tidal interactions. We also find that this relative enhancement is\ngreater for a subset of r_p < 30 h^-1 kpc pair galaxies, for which the average\ncolors offsets are -0.193 +/- 0.065 magnitudes in FUV-r and -0.159 +/- 0.048\nmagnitudes in NUV-r, corresponding to a ~25-30% increase in SSFR. We test for\nevolution in the enhancement of tidally-triggered star formation with redshift\nacross our sample redshift range and find marginal evidence for a decrease in\nSSFR enhancement from 0.25 < z < 0.5 to 0.5 < z < 0.75. This indicates that a\nchange in enhanced star formation triggered by tidal interactions in low\ndensity environments is not a contributor to the decline in the global star\nformation rate density across this redshift range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 21:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We investigate the\ndependence of these \"multi-angle effects\" on the original SN neutrino fluxes in\na three-flavor framework. We show that the pattern of the spectral crossings\n(energies where F_\\nu_e= F_\\nu_x, and F_\\bar\\nu_e= F_\\bar\\nu_x) is crucial in\ndetermining the impact of multi-angle effects on the flavor evolution. For\nneutrino spectra presenting only a single-crossing, synchronization of\ndifferent angular modes prevails over multi-angle effects, producing the known\n\"quasi single-angle\" evolution. Conversely, in the presence of spectra with\nmultiple crossing energies, synchronization is not stable. In this situation,\nmulti-angle effects would produce a sizable delay in the onset of the flavor\nconversions, as recently observed. We show that, due to the only partial\nadiabaticity of the evolution at large radii, the multi-angle suppression can\nbe so strong to dramatically affect the final oscillated neutrino spectra. In\nparticular three-flavor effects, associated with the solar parameters, could be\nwashed-out in multi-angle simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 21:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2011 15:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This notion was introduced by Erdos,\nGraham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer and Straus, who asked if a set is\nRamsey if and only if it is spherical, meaning that it lies on the surface of a\nsphere. This question (made into a conjecture by Graham) has dominated\nsubsequent work in Euclidean Ramsey theory. In this paper we introduce a new\nconjecture regarding which sets are Ramsey; this is the first ever `rival'\nconjecture to the conjecture above. Calling a finite set transitive if its\nsymmetry group acts transitively---in other words, if all points of the set\nlook the same---our conjecture is that the Ramsey sets are precisely the\ntransitive sets, together with their subsets. One appealing feature of this\nconjecture is that it reduces (in one direction) to a purely combinatorial\nstatement. We give this statement as well as several other related conjectures.\nWe also prove the first non-trivial cases of the statement. Curiously, it is\nfar from obvious that our new conjecture is genuinely different from the old.\nWe show that they are indeed different by proving that not every spherical set\nembeds in a transitive set. This result may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2010 21:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-08"}

In this\nwork, we present the \\emph{distributed mini-batch} algorithm, a method of\nconverting many serial gradient-based online prediction algorithms into\ndistributed algorithms. We prove a regret bound for this method that is\nasymptotically optimal for smooth convex loss functions and stochastic inputs.\nMoreover, our analysis explicitly takes into account communication latencies\nbetween nodes in the distributed environment. We show how our method can be\nused to solve the closely-related distributed stochastic optimization problem,\nachieving an asymptotically linear speed-up over multiple processors. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the merits of our approach on a web-scale online prediction\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 00:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 18:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

As a result, we\nfind a number of interesting behaviors not observed in the exactly solvable\ncases studied previously as follows. The even and odd parts of the generating\nfunction show different system-size dependences. Different definitions of the\ncurrent lead to the same generating function in small systems. The use of the\ntotal current is important in the Monte Carlo estimation. Moreover, a cusp\nappears in the large deviation function for the asymmetric simple exclusion\nprocess.

Ballistic electrons are\nelectrons that travel over such short distances that their phase coherence is\nmaintained. For mesoscopic devices with size smaller than the mean free path,\nthe phase relaxation length and the Fermi wavelength of electrons in the\nmedium, the transport can be considered to be coherent and hence ballistic. In\nsuch a case the electron motion can be completely described by the\nSchrodinger's wave equation with an effective mass assigned to the electron. To\ndesign a beam splitter, we draw inspiration from an electromagnetic beam\nsplitter, where the Maxwell's equations (and subsequently the Helmholtz\nequation) are used to describe the splitting of light across a thin slab of\ndielectric material. The parameters of the media and the thickness of the slab\ncan be manipulated to achieve a 50-50 beam splitter. We wish to achieve a\nsimilar 50-50 beam splitting for the electron wave.

There is a phenomenologically close relation\nbetween the GUP and Modified Dispersion Relations (MDR). However, the form of\nthe MDR in theories with extra dimensions is as yet not known. The purpose of\nthis letter is to derive the MDR in extra dimensional scenarios. To achieve\nthis goal, we focus our attention on the thermodynamics of a FRW universe\nwithin a proposed MDR in an extra dimensional model universe. We then compare\nour results with the well-known results for the thermodynamics of a FRW\nuniverse in an extra dimensional GUP setup. The result shows that the entropy\nfunctionals calculated in these two approaches are the same, pointing to a\npossible conclusion that these approaches are equivalent. In this way, we\nderive the MDR form in a model universe with extra dimensions that would have\ninteresting implications on the construction of the ultimate quantum gravity\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 06:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-28"}

After an overture, two pilot sections and a brief summary of\nthe structure of flavour violation and CP violation in the SM, we will present\nthe theoretical framework for weak decays that will allow us to distinguish\nbetween different NP scenarios. Subsequently we will present twelve concrete\nBSM models summarizing the patterns of flavour violation characteristic for\neach model. In addition to models with minimal flavour violation (MFV)\naccompanied by flavour blind phases we will discuss a number of extensions\ncontaining non-MFV sources of flavour and CP violation and, in particular, new\nlocal operators originating in right-handed charged currents and scalar\ncurrents. Next we will address various anomalies in the data as seen from the\npoint of view of the SM that appear very natural in certain extensions of the\nSM. In this presentation selected superstars of this field will play a very\nimportant role. These are processes that are very sensitive to NP effects and\nwhich are theoretically clean. Particular emphasis will be put on correlations\nbetween various observables that could allow us to distinguish between various\nNP scenarios.

For GRB 060729, bumps are seen in the optical\nlight curves (LCs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of the OT resemble those of local type Ic supernovae (SNe). For GRB\n090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detect\nwell-defined bumps in the optical LCs, as well as a change in colour, that are\nindicative of light coming from a core-collapse SN. The accompanying SNe for\nboth events are individually compared with SN1998bw, a known GRB-supernova, and\nSN1994I, a typical type Ic supernova without a known GRB counterpart, and in\nboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemble\nSN1998bw. We also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for GRB 090618,\nas well as the publicly-available SWIFT -XRT data, and discuss the properties\nof the afterglow at early times. In the context of a simple jet-like model, the\nafterglow of GRB 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break at\nt-to > 0.5 days. We then compare the rest-frame, peak V -band absolute\nmagnitudes of all of the GRB and X-Ray Flash (XRF)-associated SNe with a large\nsample of local type Ibc SNe, concluding that, when host extinction is\nconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the GRB/XRF-SNe cannot be distinguished from\nthe peak magnitudes of non-GRB/XRF SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 11:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We point out two discrepancies\nbetween their treatment and ours, however, one technical, the other having to\ndo with the very understanding of what constitutes a Gaussian random signal.\nBoth groups simulate maps using the CMB power spectrum for LCDM, while we\nsimulate a pure Gaussian sky plus the WMAP's noise, which points out the\ncontradiction with a common statement [3] that \"CMB signal is random noise of\nGaussian nature\". For as it was shown in [5], the random component is a minor\none in the CMB signal, namely, about 0.2. Accordingly, the circles we saw are a\nreal structure of the CMB sky and they are not of a random Gaussian nature.\nAlthough the structures studied certainly cannot contradict the power spectrum,\nwhich is well fitted by LCDM model, we particularly emphasize that the low\nvariance circles occur in concentric families, and this key fact cannot be\nexplained as a purely random effect.

In the latter case we derive the generalized\ndiffusion coefficients and study various dynamic regimes of the adparticle. The\ncritical values of the coupling constant $G_{cr}(T,\\Omega)$, which separate\ndomains with possible recrossing from those with the monotonic motion of the\nadparticle, are calculated as functions of a temperature $T$ and a vibrational\nfrequency $\\Omega$.

The\noptical emission lines of the filaments in the energetic outflow (\"superwind\")\nfrom the nuclear starburst region of M82 are substantially polarized. The\nH-alpha polarization degrees and angles measured by our study are consistent\nwith previous narrowband imaging polarimetry data. The polarized emission lines\nare redshifted with respect to the emission lines in the total light and\nsystemic motion of the galaxy. The emission line intensity ratios [NII]/H-alpha\nand [SII]/H-alpha in the polarized light are similar to those of the nuclear\nstar-forming region. In addition, the electron density N_e derived from\nthe[SII]6731/6717 line ratio of the polarized light is 600 - 1000 cm^-3 at a\ndistance of more than 1 kpc from the nucleus, whereas the N_e derived from the\ntotal light are less than 300 cm^-3. These facts strongly suggest that the\nemission from the nuclear starburst of M82 is scattered by dust grains\nentrained and transported outward by the superwind. A simple hollow biconical\noutflow model shows that the velocity of the outflowing dust grains, v_d,\nranges from 100 to 200 km/s near the nucleus, decreases monotonically with the\ndistance from the nucleus, and reaches about 10 km/s at around 1 kpc. The\nmotion of the dust is substantially slower than that of both ionized gas (~600\nkm/s) and molecular gas (~200 km/s) at the same distance from the nucleus of\nM82. This indicates that dust grains in the superwind are kinematically\ndecoupled from both gas components at large radii. Since the dust velocity v_d\nis much less than the escape velocity of M82 (~170 km/s at 1.5 kpc from the\nnucleus), most of the dust entrained by the superwind cannot escape to\nintergalactic space, and may fall back into the galaxy disk without any\nadditional acceleration mechanisms (such as radiation pressure).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 13:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Under appropriate conditions, Josephson junctions with\nphase-shifts can have a spatially nonuniform ground state. In recent reports,\nit is experimentally shown that a microwave drive can be used to measure the\neigenfrequency of a junction's ground state. Such a microwave spectroscopy is\nbased on the observation that when the frequency of the applied microwave is in\nthe vicinity of the natural frequency of the ground state, the junction can\nswitch to a resistive state, characterized by a non-zero junction voltage. It\nwas conjectured that the process is analogous to the resonant phenomenon in a\nsimple pendulum motion driven by a time periodic external force. In the case of\nlong junctions with phase-shifts, it would be a resonance between the internal\nbreathing mode of the ground state and the microwave field. Nonetheless, it was\nalso reported that the microwave power needed to switch the junction into a\nresistive state depends on the magnitude of the eigenfrequency to be measured.\nUsing multiple scale expansions, we show here that an infinitely long Josephson\njunction with phase-shifts cannot be switched to a resistive state by microwave\nfield with frequency close to the system's eigenfrequency, provided that the\napplied microwave amplitude is small enough, which confirms the experimental\nobservations. It is because higher harmonics with frequencies in the continuous\nspectrum are excited, in the form of continuous wave radiation. The presence of\napplied microwaves balances the nonlinear damping, creating a stable breather\nmode oscillation. We confirm our analytical results numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 14:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We focus in particular on two stochastic theories: a\nnumber-conserving Bogoliubov (ncB) approach and a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation (sGPe) that have been extensively used in numerical simulations.\nEquilibrium properties like density profiles, correlation functions, and the\ncondensate statistics are compared to predictions based upon a number of\nalternative theories. We find that due to thermal phase fluctuations, and the\ncorresponding condensate depletion, the ncB approach loses its validity at\nrelatively low temperatures. This can be attributed to the change in the\nBogoliubov spectrum, as the condensate gets thermally depleted, and to large\nfluctuations beyond perturbation theory. Although the two stochastic theories\nare built on different thermodynamic ensembles (ncB: canonical, sGPe:\ngrand-canonical), they yield the correct condensate statistics in a large BEC\n(strong enough particle interactions). For smaller systems, the sGPe results\nare prone to anomalously large number fluctuations, well-known for the\ngrand-canonical, ideal Bose gas. Based on the comparison of the above theories\nto the modified Popov approach, we propose a simple procedure for approximately\nextracting the Penrose-Onsager condensate from first- and second-order\ncorrelation functions that is computationally convenient.

However,\nenvironmental cues are unreliable due to the variability of habitats, weather\nconditions or cue-sensing mechanisms among individuals. A tempting hypothesis\nis that circadian clocks have evolved so as to be robust to fluctuations in\ndaylight or other cues when entrained by the day/night cycle. To test this\nhypothesis, we analyze the synchronization behavior of weakly and periodically\nforced oscillators in terms of their phase response curve (PRC), which measures\nphase changes induced by a perturbation applied at different phases. We\nestablish a general relationship between, on the one side, the robustness of\nkey entrainment properties such as stability and phase shift and, on the other\nside, the shape of the PRC as characterized by a specific curvature or the\nexistence of a dead zone. This result can be applied to computational models of\ncircadian clocks where it accounts for the disparate robustness properties of\nvarious forcing schemes. Finally, the analysis of PRCs measured experimentally\nin several organisms strongly suggests a case of convergent evolution toward an\noptimal strategy for maintaining a clock that is accurate and robust to\nenvironmental fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 14:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The framework\nis based on the so-called generalized mutual information (GMI), and the\nanalysis in particular benefits from the setup of Gaussian codebook ensemble\nand nearest-neighbor decoding, for which it is established that the GMI takes a\ngeneral form analogous to the channel capacity of undistorted Gaussian\nchannels, with a reduced \"effective\" signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that depends\non the nominal SNR and the distortion model. When applied to specific\ndistortion models, an array of results of engineering relevance is obtained.\nFor channels with transmit-side distortion only, it is shown that a\nconventional approach, which treats the distorted signal as the sum of the\noriginal signal part and a uncorrelated distortion part, achieves the GMI. For\nchannels with output quantization, closed-form expressions are obtained for the\neffective SNR and the GMI, and related optimization problems are formulated and\nsolved for quantizer design. Finally, super-Nyquist sampling is analyzed within\nthe general framework, and it is shown that sampling beyond the Nyquist rate\nincreases the GMI for all SNR. For example, with a binary symmetric output\nquantization, information rates exceeding one bit per channel use are\nachievable by sampling the output at four times the Nyquist rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 15:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 13:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}
