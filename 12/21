We solved the complete Baade-Wesselink equation by\ncalibrating the surface brightness function with a recent grid of atmosphere\nmodels. The new approach was adopted to estimate the mean radii of a sample of\nGalactic Cepheids for which are available precise light curves in the Walraven\nbands. Current radii agree, within the errors, quite well with Cepheid radii\nbased on recent optical and near-infrared interferometric measurements. We also\ntested the impact of the projection factor on the Period-Radius relation using\ntwo different values (p=1.36, p=1.27) that bracket the estimates available in\nthe literature. We found that the agreement of our Period-Radius relation with\nsimilar empirical and theoretical Period-Radius relations in the recent\nliterature, improves by changing the projection factor from p=1.36 to p=1.27.\nOur Period-Radius relation is log(R)=(0.75\\pm 0.03)log(P)+(1.10 \\pm 0.03), with\na rms=0.03 dex. Thanks to accurate estimates of the effective temperature of\nthe selected Cepheids, we also derived the Period-Luminosity relation in the V\nband and we found Mv=(-2.78 \\pm 0.11)log(P)+(-1.42 \\pm 0.11) with rms=0.13 mag,\nfor p=1.27. It agrees quite well with recent results in the literature, while\nthe relation for p=1.36 deviates by more than 2sigma. We conclude that, even\ntaking into account the intrinsic dispersion of the obtained Period-Luminosity\nrelations, that is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the effect of the\nprojection factor, the results of this paper seem to favour the value p = 1.27.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 16:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In the absence of inner disk\ndust depletion, we find that it requires three to four giant planets to open up\nlarge enough gaps to be consistent with inferences from spectral energy\ndistributions, because the gap width is limited by the tendency of the planets\nto be driven together into 2:1 resonances. With very strong tidal torques\nand/or rapid planetary accretion, fewer planets can also generate a large\ncavity interior to the locally formed gap(s) by preventing outer disk material\nfrom moving in. In these cases, however, the reduction of surface density\nproduces a corresponding reduction in the inner disk accretion rate onto the\nstar; this makes it difficult to explain the observed accretion rates of the\npre/transitional disks. We find that even with four planets in disks,\nadditional substantial dust depletion is required to explain observed disk\ngaps/holes. Substantial dust settling and growth, with consequent significant\nreductions in optical depths, is inferred for typical T Tauri disks in any\ncase, and an earlier history of dust growth is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat pre/transitional disks are explained by the presence of giant planets. We\nconclude that the depths and widths of gaps, and disk accretion rates in\npre/transitional disks cannot be reproduced by a planet-induced gap opening\nscenario alone. Significant dust depletion is also required within the\ngaps/holes. Order of magnitude estimates suggest the mass of small dust\nparticles (<1 micron) relative to the gas must be depleted to 1e-5 -- 1e-2 of\nthe interstellar medium value, implying a very efficient mechanism of small\ndust removal or dust growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 16:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In TSS's settings, nodes have two possible states (active or\nnon-active) and the threshold triggering the activation of a node is given by\nthe number of its active neighbors. Dealing with fault tolerance in a majority\nbased system the two possible states are used to denote faulty or non-faulty\nnodes, and the threshold is given by the state of the majority of neighbors.\nHere, the major effort was in determining the distribution of initial faults\nleading the entire system to a faulty behavior. Such an activation pattern,\nalso known as dynamic monopoly (or shortly dynamo), was introduced by Peleg in\n1996. In this paper we extend the TSS problem's settings by representing nodes'\nstates with a \"multicolored\" set. The extended version of the problem can be\ndescribed as follows: let G be a simple connected graph where every node is\nassigned a color from a finite ordered set C = {1, . . ., k} of colors. At each\nlocal time step, each node can recolor itself, depending on the local\nconfigurations, with the color held by the majority of its neighbors. Given G,\nwe study the initial distributions of colors leading the system to a k\nmonochromatic configuration in toroidal meshes, focusing on the minimum number\nof initial k-colored nodes. We find upper and lower bounds to the size of a\ndynamo, and then special classes of dynamos, outlined by means of a new\napproach based on recoloring patterns, are characterized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 17:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-21"}

The orthodox quantum mechanics could be created\nonly at the cost of renunciation of reality as the aim of natural science. The\ndescription only of phenomena, i.e. results of observation, should not be\nuniversal if no one believes that these phenomena are manifestation of a unique\nreality. Such belief concerning quantum mechanics is quite unacceptable because\nof irremediably conflict with special relativity. Nevertheless the quantum\nmechanics was developed and apprehended by most physicists as a universal\ntheory of a quantum world. This fundamental discrepancy between the essence of\nthe orthodox quantum mechanics and its history of development and studying has\nresulted both to an illusion about the aim of its description among most\nphysicists and to the consideration of its fundamental obscurity as a universal\nproblem among experts in quantum foundation. The aim of this paper is to show\nthat quantum phenomena can not be described universally. It is indicated that\nrather the Schrodinger's than Born's interpretation of the wave function is\nvalid for description of many quantum phenomena. The fundamental obscurity with\nwhich we are faced at the description, for example, macroscopic quantum\nphenomena differs fundamentally from the one with which the founders of the\nquantum theory were faced on atomic level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 17:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-21"}

We focus primarily on collision kernels\nwhich would exhibit an instantaneous gelation transition in the absence of any\nregularisation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that for such kernels with\nmonodisperse initial data, the regularised gelation time decreases as M\nincreases, consistent with the expectation that the gelation time is zero in\nthe unregularised system. This decrease appears to be a logarithmically slow\nfunction of M, indicating that instantaneously gelling kernels may still be\njustifiable as physical models despite the fact that they are highly singular\nin the absence of a cut-off. We also study the case when a source of monomers\nis introduced in the regularised system. In this case a stationary state is\nreached. We present a complete analytic description of this regularised\nstationary state for the model kernel, K(m_1,m_2)=max{m_1,m_2}^v, which gels\ninstantaneously when M tends to infinity if v>1. The stationary cluster size\ndistribution decays as a stretched exponential for small cluster sizes and\ncrosses over to a power law decay with exponent v for large cluster sizes. The\ntotal particle density in the stationary state slowly vanishes as (Log\nM^(v-1))^-1/2 when M gets large. The approach to the stationary state is\nnon-trivial : oscillations about the stationary state emerge from the interplay\nbetween the monomer injection and the cut-off, M, which decay very slowly when\nM is large. A quantitative analysis of these oscillations is provided for the\naddition model which describes the situation in which clusters can only grow by\nabsorbing monomers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 18:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 13:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

With the driving frequency tuned\njust below the lowest frequency transition between valence subbands, a\nparticularly interesting phenomenon is observed. As the THz power increases, a\nnew peak emerges above the frequency of the undriven exciton peak which grows\nand eventually becomes the larger of the two. This reversal of relative peak\nintensity is inconsistent with the Autler-Townes effect in a three-state system\nwhile within the rotating wave approximation (RWA). In the samples\ninvestigated, the Bloch-Siegert shift (associated with abandoning the RWA),\nexciton binding energy, the Rabi energy, and non-resonant AC Stark effects are\nall of comparable magnitude. Solution of a semiconductor Bloch model with one\nconduction and multiple valence subbands indicates that the AC Stark effect is\npredominantly responsible for the observed phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 19:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2011 17:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-12"}

In the\nliterature, this phenomenon is sometimes interpreted as the result of some\nattraction of the particles towards this high flow rate branch.

Arguments for this attraction are given and a discussion on\nthe sometimes misleading arguments found in the literature is proposed.\nFinally, the enrichment in particles in the high flow rate branch is shown to\nbe mainly a consequence of the initial distribution in the inlet branch, which\nshows necessarily some depletion near the walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 19:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 20:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-27"}

In these rather simple\nsystems, it is well-known that TDDFT methods using conventional hybrid\nfunctionals surprisingly fail in describing the low-lying La and Lb valence\nstates, resulting in large, growing errors for the La state and an incorrect\nenergetic ordering as a function of molecular size. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that the range-separated formalism largely eliminates both of these\nerrors and also provides a consistent description of excitonic properties in\nthese systems. We further demonstrate that re-optimizing the percentage of\nHartree-Fock exchange in conventional hybrids to match wavefunction-based\nbenchmark calculations still yields serious errors, and a full 100%\nHartree-Fock range separation is essential for simultaneously describing both\nof the La and Lb transitions. Based on an analysis of electron-hole transition\ndensity matrices, we finally show that conventional hybrid functionals\noverdelocalize excitons and underestimate quasiparticle energy gaps in the\nacene systems. The results of our present study emphasize the importance of\nboth a range-separated and asymptotically-correct contribution of exchange in\nTDDFT for investigating optoelectronic and excitonic properties, even for these\nsimple valence excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 20:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-21"}

However, there is strong observational and\ntheoretical evidence that at least part of the H2 emission is produced inside\nthe ionized region of such objects. The aim of the present work is to calculate\nand analyze the infrared line emission of H2 produced inside the ionized region\nof planetary nebulae using a one-dimensional photoionization code. The\nphotoionization code Aangaba was improved in order to calculate the statistical\npopulation of the H2 energy levels and the intensity of the H2 infrared\nemission lines in physical conditions typical of planetary nebulae. A grid of\nmodels was obtained and the results are analyzed and compared with the\nobservational data. We show that the contribution of the ionized region to the\nH2 line emission can be important, particularly in the case of nebulae with\nhigh temperature central stars. This result explains why H2 emission is more\nfrequently observed in bipolar planetary nebulae (Gatley's rule), since this\nkind of object typically has hotter stars. Collisional excitation plays an\nimportant role on the population of the rovibrational levels of the electronic\nground state of H2. Radiative mechanisms are also important, particularly for\nthe upper vibrational levels. Formation pumping can have minor effects on the\nline intensities produced by de-excitation from very high rotational levels,\nespecially in dense and dusty environments.

The method of using a\ntransfer function to determine a pulse after it passes through a cavity is well\nknown. However, this approach cannot be used to determine the behavior of the\npulse inside the cavity. To circumvent this constraint, we use an approach that\nstarts by finding a self-consistent solution for a monochromatic field of\ninfinite spatial and temporal extents, and determine its amplitudes before,\ninside, and after the cavity. We then construct a Gaussian input pulse by\nadding a set of these waves, properly phased and weighted, to represent a\nmoving pulse before the cavity. Adding these waves at various time intervals\nthen yields the complete spatial profile everywhere, including before, inside\nand after the cavity. We first confirm the prediction of this model by\nanalyzing the behavior of a pulse passing through an empty cavity, and\ncomparing the prediction of the output with the one produced by the transfer\nfunction method. We then apply the technique to a cavity containing a\nfast-light medium. The resulting model allows us to visualize the behavior of\nthe pulse as it propagates superluminally inside the cavity, and interferes\nwith itself through multiple bounces. For a vanishing group index, an\ninterference pattern is formed immediately after the pulse enters the cavity,\nwith an output pulse emerging with no time delay or distortion. The results\nobtained here illustrates the physical mechanism behind pulse propagation\nthrough a white light cavity, a process we have proposed earlier for realizing\na high bandwidth, long delay data buffering system\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 21:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 17:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

Specifically, we will show why\nthis special limit gives universal equations from the Painlev\\'e II hierarchy\nof integrable systems theory. Then, following the approach of (bi) orthogonal\npolynomials introduced by Mehta to compute partition functions, we will find\nRiemann-Hilbert and isomonodromic problems connected to matrix models, making\nthe link with the theory of Jimbo, Miwa and Ueno. In particular, we will\ndescribe how the hermitian two-matrix models provide a degenerate case of\nJimbo-Miwa-Ueno's theory that we will generalize in this context.

By\nsubstituting more robust \"shape descriptors\" into these schemes we extend their\napplicability to structures formed from more complex building blocks. Here, we\ndescribe several structural characterization schemes and shape descriptors that\ncan be used to obtain various types of structural information about particle\nsystems. We demonstrate the application of shape matching algorithms to a\nvariety of example problems, for topics including local and global structure\nidentification and classification, automated phase diagram mapping, and the\nconstruction of spatial and temporal correlation functions. The methods are\napplicable to a wide range of systems, both simulated and experimental,\nprovided particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 03:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-18"}

Radio\ncontinuum emission at 610 MHz and 325 MHz is detected from all the observed\ngalaxies whereas only a few are detected at 240 MHz. In our sample, three\ngalaxies are members of groups and two galaxies (Mrk 1069 and I Zw 97) are\nisolated galaxies.

This, we suggest,\nindicates that the star formation in the latter group of galaxies has recently\nbeen triggered and that the environment in which the galaxy is evolving plays a\nrole.

The starting point is the common envelope\nphase in the evolution of a binary consisting of a red super giant and a\nneutron star. As the neutron star spirals towards the center of its companion\nit spins up via disk accretion. Depending on the specific angular momentum of\ngas captured by the neutron star via the Bondi-Hoyle mechanism, it may reach\nmillisecond periods either when it is still inside the common envelope or after\nit has merged with the companion core. The high accretion rate may result in\nstrong differential rotation of the neutron star and generation of the\nmagnetar-strength magnetic field. The magnetar wind can blow away the common\nenvelope if its magnetic field is as strong as $10^{15}\\,$G, and can destroy\nthe entire companion if it is as strong as $10^{16}\\,$G. The total explosion\nenergy can be comparable to the rotational energy of a millisecond pulsar and\nreach $10^{52}\\,$erg. However, only a small amount of $^{56}$Ni is expected to\nbe produced this way. The result is an unusual type-II supernova with very high\nluminosity during the plateau phase, followed by a sharp drop in brightness and\na steep light-curve tail. The remnant is either a solitary magnetar or a close\nbinary involving a Wolf-Rayet star and a magnetar. When this Wolf-Rayet star\nexplodes this will be a third supernovae explosion in the same binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 08:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 15:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The competition\nprovided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to\ndiscover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games,\nmore accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating\nsystem, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating\nsystem. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the\noutcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of\nthe players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that\navoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is\nrelatively small and one has to be careful not to draw \"too many conclusions\"\nout of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs\nof such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a\nvery good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the\nprivate hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the\nnumber of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the\nopponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for\ntraining the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage\nand regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 09:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

For time transfer\nthe 1PPS output is initially synchronized and then monitored by TWSTFT\nequipment connected by a second optical fiber to observe instabilities and\nuncertainties. Depending on further needs in future the transferred signal can\nbe monitored only (for software correction) or controlled in real time by\nadding adequate phase shifters. We discuss procedures for a proper calibration\nof such TTTOF links and show results of experiments using fiber lengths up to\ntwo kilometers which prove that the proposed method is well suitable for the\nenvisaged purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 09:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

Using the\nKeldysh technique, we are able to investigate the dynamics of the combined\nsystem for an arbitrary ratio of $eV/\\hbar \\Omega$, where V is the applied bias\nof the tunnel junction and $\\Omega$ the eigenfrequency of the oscillator. In\nthis sense, we go beyond the Markov approximation of previous works where these\nparameters were restricted to the regime $eV/\\hbar \\Omega\\gg 1$. Furthermore,\nwe also go beyond the Born approximation because we calculate the finite\nfrequency current noise of the tunnel junction up to fourth order in the\ntunneling amplitudes. Interestingly, we discover different ways to probe both\nposition and momentum properties of NEMS. On the one hand, for a non-stationary\noscillator, we find a complex finite frequency noise of the tunnel junction. By\nanalyzing the real and the imaginary part of this noise separately, we conclude\nthat a simple tunnel junction detector can probe both position- and\nmomentum-based observables of the non-stationary oscillator. On the other hand,\nfor a stationary oscillator, a more complicated setup based on an\nAharonov-Bohm-loop tunnel junction detector is needed.

In these models, a tachyonic instability at\nthe end of inflation leads to a succession of exponentially large increases and\n\\emph{decreases} of the inflaton fluctuations as the inflaton condensate\noscillates around the minimum of its potential. The net effect is a competition\nbetween low-momentum modes which grow and decrease significantly, and modes\nwith higher momenta which grow less but also decrease less.

Depending\non the parameters, preheating may be so efficient that it completes in less\nthan one oscillation of the inflaton condensate. Preheating after small field\ninflation may also be followed by a long matter-dominated stage before the\nuniverse thermalizes, depending on the energy scale of inflation and the\ndetails of the inflaton interactions. Finally, another feature of these models\nis that the spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations at the end of preheating may\nbe peaked around the Hubble scale. In fact, because preheating starts when the\nsecond slow-roll parameter $|\\eta|$ becomes of order unity while the first\nslow-roll parameter $\\epsilon$ is still much smaller than one, the universe is\nstill inflating during preheating and the modes amplified by the initial\ntachyonic instability leave the Hubble radius. This may lead to an abundant\nproduction of primordial black holes and gravitational waves with frequencies\ntoday which are naturally small enough to fall into the range accessible by\nhigh-sensitivity interferometric experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 13:58:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2011 15:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Alkali atoms appear as good candidates for\ninterferometric measurements but there are challenges to be overcome. The only\npractical way to generate a suitable E-field is to use the ac Stark effect\nwhich induces an instability of the dressed atom. Besides atom loss, this might\ninvalidate Berry's phase derivation but this latter problem can be solved by an\nappropriate detuning. The former puts an upper limit to the cycle duration,\nwhich is bounded below by the adiabatic condition. By relying upon our previous\nanalysis of the non-adiabatic corrections, we have been able to reach a\ncompromise for the $^{87}$Rb hf level F=2, m=0 state, which is our candidate\nfor an interferometric measurement of the exotic Berry's phase generated by a\nrotation of the E-field around the fixed B-field.

We describe a new technique, which provides an accurate\nmass reconstruction of the original resonance and does not suffer from the\nlimitations of the collinear approximation. The major improvement comes from\nreplacing assumptions of the collinear approximation by a requirement that\nmutual orientations of the neutrinos and other decay products are consistent\nwith the mass and decay kinematics of a $\\tau$ lepton.

A very simple model of excitation of disk material is in\nremarkable agreement with the observations, yet it seems that the very\nexistence of a circumbinary disk is regarded as controversial.\n  Published spectra, taken almost nightly over two orbital periods of the\nbinary system, show H alpha and He I lines; these were analysed as\nsuperpositions of Gaussian components. A model in which the excitation of any\ngiven patch of putative circumbinary material is proportional to the inverse\nsquare of its instantaneous distance from the compact object was constructed\nand compared with observations.\n  The new model provides an excellent description of the observations. The\nvariation of the H alpha and He I spectra with orbital phase are described\nquantitatively provided the radius of the emitting ring is not much greater\nthan the radius of the closest stable circumbinary orbit.\n  The new analysis has greatly strengthened the case for a circumbinary disk\norbiting the SS 433 system with a speed of over 200 km/s and presents supposed\nalternative explanations with major difficulties.
