Efficient analysis methods\nare needed that are accessible to modelers and easy to use. Method: By\nconverting discrete models into algebraic models, tools from computational\nalgebra can be used to analyze their dynamics.

More in general, coronal and photospheric\nabundances in late-type stars appear to be different in many cases, but\nunderstanding how chemical stratification effects work in stellar atmospheres\nrequires an observational base larger than currently available. We obtained\nXMM-Newton high-resolution X-ray spectra of Tau Bootis, a well known nearby\nstar with a Jovian-mass close-in planet. We analyzed these data with the aim to\nperform a detailed line-based emission measure analysis and derive the\nabundances of individual elements in the corona with two different methods\napplied independently. We compared the coronal abundances of Tau Bootis with\npublished photospheric abundances based on high-resolution optical spectra and\nwith those of other late-type stars with different magnetic activity levels,\nincluding the Sun. We find that the two methods provide consistent results\nwithin the statistical uncertainties for both the emission measure distribution\nof the hot plasma and for the coronal abundances, with discrepancies at the\n2-sigma level limited to the amount of plasma at temperatures of 3-4 MK and to\nthe O and Ni abundances. In both cases, the elements for which both coronal and\nphotospheric measurements are available (C, N, O, Si, Fe, and Ni) result\nsystematically less abundant in the corona by a factor 3 or more, with the\nexception of the coronal Ni abundance, which is similar to the photospheric\nvalue. Comparison with other late-type stars of similar activity level shows\nthat these coronal/photospheric abundance ratios are peculiar to Tau Bootis and\npossibly related to the characteristic over-metallicity of this planet-hosting\nstar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 18:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 12:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

No-signaling strategies are a curious class\nof joint strategy that cannot in general be implemented without communication\nbetween the provers, yet cannot be used as a black box to establish\ncommunication between them. Attention is restricted in this paper to two-turn\ninteractions in which the verifier asks questions of each of the four provers\nand decides whether to accept or reject based on their responses.\n  We prove that the complexity class of decision problems that admit two-turn\ninteractive proofs with competing teams of no-signaling provers is a subset of\nPSPACE.

By this new model, superconducting state\nconsists of the dynamic bound state of superconducting electrons, which is\nformed by the high-energy nonbonding electrons through dynamic interaction with\ntheir surrounding lattice to trap themselves into the three - dimensional\npotential wells lying in energy at above the Fermi level of the material. The\nbinding energy of superconducting electrons dominates the superconducting\ntransition temperature in the corresponding material. Under an electric field,\nsuperconducting electrons move coherently with lattice distortion wave and\nperiodically exchange their excitation energy with chain lattice, that is, the\nsuperconducting electrons transfer periodically between their dynamic bound\nstate and conducting state. Thus, the intrinsic feature of superconductivity is\nto generate an oscillating current under a dc voltage. The coherence lengths in\ncuprates must have the value equal to an even number times the lattice\nconstant. A superconducting material must simultaneously satisfy three criteria\nrequired by superconductivity. Almost all of the puzzling behavior of the\ncuprates can be uniquely understood under this new model. We demonstrate that\nthe factor 2 in Josephson current equation, in fact, is resulting from 2V, the\nvoltage drops across the two superconductor sections on both sides of a\njunction, not from the Cooper pair, and the magnetic flux is quantized in units\nof h/e, postulated by London, not in units of h/2e.
