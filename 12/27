By performing lattice\nBoltzmann simulations of the flow inside a mixer geometry, introducing massless\nand non-interacting tracer particles and following their trajectories the\nfinite time Lyapunov exponents can be calculated. The applicability of the\nmethod is demonstrated by a comparison of the improved geometrical structure of\nthe staggered herringbone mixer with available literature data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2010 23:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 07:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2011 08:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 17:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}

We expect to apply outcomes of this article to several\ntypes of Floer homology, thus we define Morse homology purely axiomatically and\nalgebraically. The Morse homology on noncompact manifolds generally depends on\nthe choice of Morse functions; it is easy to see that critical points may\nescape along homotopies of Morse functions on noncompact manifolds. Even worse,\nhomology classes also can escape along homotopies even though critical points\nare alive. The aim of the article is two fold. First, we give an example which\nbreaks the invariance property by the escape of homology classes and find\nappropriate growth conditions on homotopies which prevent such an escape. This\ntakes advantage of the bifurcation method. Another goal is to apply the first\nresults to the invariance problem of Rabinowitz Floer homology. The bifurcation\nmethod for Rabinowitz Floer homology, however, is not worked out yet.

Another way to obtain the same result is by using a flatter\ninitial mass function (IMF) in large galaxies, increasing in this way the\nnumber of Type II Supernovae and therefore the production rate of\nalpha-elements. The integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) theory\npredicts that the higher the star formation rate, the flatter the IMF.

The mean-square bond\nlength and mean bond angle are the critical parameters that influence the\ntime-varying stress developed in the polymer. The bond length distribution\nalong the chain is uniform without any abrupt changes at the ends. Among the\nexternally set parameters such as density, temperature, strain rate, and chain\nlength, the density as well as the chain length of the polymer have a\nsignificant effect on the stress. At high density values, changes in\nmean-square bond length dominates over changes in radius of gyration and\nend-to-end length. In other words, bond deformations dominate as opposed to\nchanges in size and shape. Also, there is a large change in the mean-square\nbond length that is reflected as a jump in the stress. Beyond a particular\nvalue of the chain length, $n = 50$, called the entanglement length,\nstress-response is found to have distinctly different behavior which we\nattribute to the entanglement effects. Short chain polymers more or less behave\nlike rigid molecules. There is no significant change in their internal\nstructure when loaded.

We design an automated security\nanalysis technique, parametric in the number of users and roles, by adapting\nrecent methods for model checking infinite state systems that use first-order\nlogic and state-of-the-art theorem proving techniques. Preliminary experiments\nwith a prototype implementations seem to confirm the scalability of our\ntechnique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2010 10:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

These three laws commonly known as the three laws of robotics are\nthe earliest forms of depiction for the needs of ethics in Robotics. In\nsimplistic language Isaac Asimov is able to explain what rules a robot must\nconfine itself to in order to maintain societal sanctity. However, even though\nthey are outdated they still represent some of our innate fears which are\nbeginning to resurface in present day 21st Century. Our society is on the\nadvent of a new revolution; a revolution led by advances in Computer Science,\nArtificial Intelligence & Nanotechnology. Some of our advances have been so\nphenomenal that we surpassed what was predicted by the Moore's law. With these\nadvancements comes the fear that our future may be at the mercy of these\nandroids. Humans today are scared that we, ourselves, might create something\nwhich we cannot control. We may end up creating something which can not only\nlearn much faster than anyone of us can, but also evolve faster than what the\ntheory of evolution has allowed us to. The greatest fear is not only that we\nmight lose our jobs to these intelligent beings, but that these beings might\nend up replacing us at the top of the cycle. The public hysteria has been\nheightened more so by a number of cultural works which depict annihilation of\nthe human race by robots. Right from Frankenstein to I, Robot mass media has\nalso depicted such issues. This paper is an effort to understand the need for\nethics in Robotics or simply termed as Roboethics. This is achieved by the\nstudy of artificial beings and the thought being put behind them. By the end of\nthe paper, however, it is concluded that there isn't a need for ethical robots\nbut more so ever a need for ethical roboticists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2010 11:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

We address the problem of continuous-variable (unconditional and\nconditional) teleportation of a pure single-photon state and a mixed attenuated\nsingle-photon state generally in a nonunity gain regime. Our figure of merit is\nthe maximum of negativity of the Wigner function that witnesses highly\nnon-classical feature of the teleported state. We find that negativity of the\nWigner function of the single-photon state can be {\\em unconditionally}\nteleported for arbitrarily weak squeezed state used to create the entangled\nstate shared in the teleportation. In contrast, for the attenuated\nsingle-photon state there is a strict threshold squeezing one has to surpass in\norder to successfully teleport the negativity of its Wigner function. The {\\em\nconditional} teleportation allows to approach perfect transmission of the\nsingle photon for an arbitrarily low squeezing at a cost of a success rate. On\nthe other hand, for the attenuated single photon conditional teleportation\ncannot overcome the squeezing threshold of the unconditional teleportation and\nit approaches negativity of the input state only if the squeezing\nsimultaneously increases. However, as soon as the threshold squeezing is\nsurpassed the conditional teleportation still pronouncedly outperforms the\nunconditional one.

Over a large range of scales, both the\naverage conditional density and its variance show a nontrivial scaling\nbehavior: at small scales, r<20 Mpc/h, the average (conditional) density scales\nas 1/r. At larger scales, the density depends only weakly (logarithmically) on\nthe system size and density fluctuations follow the Gumbel distribution of\nextreme value statistics. These complex behaviors are different from what is\nexpected in a homogeneous distribution with Gaussian fluctuations.

The mixing of $\\nu_s$ in\nthe eigenstate $\\nu_3$ with $\\sin^2 \\beta \\sim 0.1$ leads to production of\n$\\nu_s$ via oscillations in the Universe and to additional contribution $\\Delta\nN_{eff} \\approx 0.7 - 1$ before the big bang nucleosynthesis and later. Such a\nmixing can be tested in forthcoming experiments with the atmospheric neutrinos\nas well as in future accelerator long baseline experiments. It has substantial\nimpact on conversion of the supernova neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2010 15:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 15:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It is shown how to build a bridge\nbetween RGT and emotions. For this purpose the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD)\nmodel is adopted. The major advantages of RGT are its ability to predict human\nbehavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind. On the\nother hand, PAD provides ultimate approach to model emotions. It is illustrated\nthat emotions are reflexive processes and, consequently, RGT fused with PAD\nmodel is natural solution to model emotional interactions between people. The\nfusion of RGT and PAD, called Emotional Reflexive Games (ERG), inherits the key\nfeatures of both components. Using ERG, we show how reflexive control can be\nsuccessfully applied to model human emotional states. Up to date, EGR is a\nunique methodology capable of modeling human reflexive processes and emotional\naspects simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2010 15:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

Our model consists of\na source transmitting packets of a single flow to a set of $n$ users over\nindependent erasure channels. The source performs random linear network coding\n(RLNC) over $k$ (coding window size) packets and broadcasts them to the users.\nWe note that the broadcast throughput of RLNC must vanish with increasing $n$,\nfor any fixed $k.$ Hence, in contrast to other works in the literature, we\ninvestigate how the coding window size $k$ must scale for increasing $n$. Our\nanalysis reveals that the coding window size of $\\Theta(\\ln(n))$ represents a\nphase transition rate, below which the throughput converges to zero, and above\nwhich it converges to the broadcast capacity. Further, we characterize the\nasymptotic distribution of decoding delay and provide approximate expressions\nfor the mean and variance of decoding delay for the scaling regime of\n$k=\\omega(\\ln(n)).$ These asymptotic expressions reveal the impact of channel\ncorrelations on the throughput and delay performance of RLNC. We also show how\nour analysis can be extended to other rateless block coding schemes such as the\nLT codes. Finally, we comment on the extension of our results to the cases of\ndependent channels across users and asymmetric channel model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2010 17:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 01:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
