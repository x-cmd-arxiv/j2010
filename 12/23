While the former has an operational definition,\nunlike the latter, it also tends to overestimate non-classicality because of a\nlack of optimization over local measurements. Applied to quantum walks, we find\nthat MID, while acting as a loose upper bound on QD, still tends to reflect\ncorrectly the trends in the behavior of the latter. However, there are regimes\nwhere its behavior is not indicative of non-classicality: in particular, we\nfind an instance where MID increases with the application of noise, where we\nexpect a reduction of quantumness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 17:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 14:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 03:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-01"}

This quantity, in contrast to\nthe remaining Jensen divergences, is very sensitive to the fluctuations of the\nprobability distributions because it is controlled by the (local) Fisher\ninformation, which is a gradient functional of the distribution. So, it is\nappropriate and informative when studying the similarity of distributions,\nmainly for those having oscillatory character. The new Jensen-Fisher divergence\nshares with the Jensen-Shannon divergence the following properties:\nnon-negativity, additivity when applied to an arbitrary number of probability\ndensities, symmetry under exchange of these densities, vanishing if and only if\nall the densities are equal, and definiteness even when these densities present\nnon-common zeros. Moreover, the Jensen-Fisher divergence is shown to be\nexpressed in terms of the relative Fisher information as the Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence does in terms of the Kullback-Leibler or relative Shannon entropy.\nFinally the Jensen-Shannon and Jensen-Fisher divergences are compared for the\nfollowing three large, non-trivial and qualitatively different families of\nprobability distributions: the sinusoidal, generalized gamma-like and\nRakhmanov-Hermite distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 17:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

Mars has a low-density atmosphere, so deep convection\ncan be triggered by small amounts of latent heat release. In our reference\nsimulation, the buoyant plume lifts vapor above condensation level, forming a\n20km-high optically-thick cloud. Ice grains grow to 200 microns radius and fall\nnear (or in) the lake at mean rates up to 1.5 mm/hr water equivalent (maximum\nrates up to 6 mm/hr water equivalent). Because atmospheric temperatures outside\nthe surface layer are always well below 273K, supersaturation and condensation\nbegin at low altitudes above lakes on Mars. In contrast to Earth lake-effect\nstorms, lake storms on Mars involve continuous precipitation, and their\nvertical velocities and plume heights exceed those of tropical thunderstorms on\nEarth. Convection does not reach above the planetary boundary layer for lakes\n<<10^3 km^2 or for atmospheric pressure >O(10^2) mbar. Instead, vapor is\nadvected downwind with little cloud formation.

For example, in\nexploration geosciences, noisy drill hole records need separating into\nstratigraphic zones, and in biophysics, jumps between molecular dwell states\nneed extracting from noisy fluorescence microscopy signals. Many PWC denoising\nmethods exist, including total variation regularization, mean shift clustering,\nstepwise jump placement, running medians, convex clustering shrinkage and\nbilateral filtering; conventional linear signal processing methods are\nfundamentally unsuited however. This paper shows that most of these methods are\nassociated with a special case of a generalized functional, minimized to\nachieve PWC denoising. The minimizer can be obtained by diverse solver\nalgorithms, including stepwise jump placement, convex programming, finite\ndifferences, iterated running medians, least angle regression, regularization\npath following, and coordinate descent. We introduce novel PWC denoising\nmethods, which, for example, combine global mean shift clustering with local\ntotal variation smoothing. Head-to-head comparisons between these methods are\nperformed on synthetic data, revealing that our new methods have a useful role\nto play. Finally, overlaps between the methods of this paper and others such as\nwavelet shrinkage, hidden Markov models, and piecewise smooth filtering are\ntouched on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 20:55:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2011 09:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

For example, the rate for\n$D_s$ semileptonic decay is known to be $(17.0 \\pm 5.3)%$ lower than those for\n$D^0$ or $D^+$, and the model accounts for this difference. When applied to\nhadrons containing $b$ quarks, this method implies that the $B_s$ semileptonic\ndecay rate is about 1% higher than that of the nonstrange $B$ mesons. This\nsmall difference thus suggests surprisingly good local quark-hadron duality for\n$B$ semileptonic decays, complementing the expectation based on inclusive\nquark-hadron duality that these differences in rates should not exceed a few\ntenths of a percent. For $\\Lambda_b$ semileptonic decay, however, the inclusive\nrate is predicted to be about 13% greater than that of the nonstrange $B$\nmesons.

The detailed analysis of Hinode EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) timeseries observations of an active region (known to\ncontain propagating disturbances) shows strongly correlated, quasi-periodic,\noscillations in intensity, Doppler shift, and line width. No frequency doubling\nis visible in the latter. The enhancements in the moments of the line profile\nare generally accompanied by a faint, quasi-periodically occurring, excess\nemission at ~100 km/s in the blue wing of coronal emission lines. The\ncorrespondence of quasi-periodic excess wing emission and the moments of the\nline profile indicates that repetitive high-velocity upflows are responsible\nfor the oscillatory behavior observed.

To allow a rich class of control\nsystems to be abstracted, the update maps of the timed game automaton are\nextended.\n  Conditions on the partitioning of the state space and the control are set up\nto obtain sound abstractions. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate\nthe method applied to a control problem related to navigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 21:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-24"}

Analysing RV data to determine the\nparameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challenge\nowing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies between\norbital parameters. Determining the number of planets favoured by the observed\ndata is an even more difficult task. Bayesian model selection provides a\nmathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginal\nposterior probabilities of models with different number of planets, but the use\nof this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by the\ncomputational cost of the evaluating Bayesian evidence. Nonetheless, Bayesian\nmodel selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existing\nobservational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets. We present a\nnew and efficient Bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolar\nplanets, as well as for inferring their orbital parameters, without having to\ncalculate directly the Bayesian evidence for models containing a large number\nof planets. Instead, we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain a\nconservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additional\nplanet into the model.

The mode\npropagates outwards with a phase speed consisting of two components. One is the\nphase speed of the mode in the plasma rest frame, the other is the speed of the\nsolar wind streaming along the plasma sheet. The former can be well represented\nby the Alfven speed outside the plasma sheet, according to a linear wave\ndispersion analysis with a simplified slab model of magnetized plasmas. The\nradial profiles of the Alfven speed can be deduced with constraints put on the\nspeed of the solar wind, which is done by making use of the measurements of\nstreamer blobs flowing passively in the wind. The radial profiles of the\nstrength of the coronal magnetic field can be depicted once the electron\ndensity distribution is specified, this is done by inverting the observed\npolarized brightness data.

A natural measure is the increase of payoff. We consider natural mappings\nbetween classical and quantum states, and study how well those mappings\npreserve the equilibrium properties. Among other results, we exhibit correlated\nequilibrium $p$ whose quantum superposition counterpart $\\sum_s\n\\sqrt{p(s)}\\ket{s}$ is far from being a quantum correlated equilibrium;\nactually a player can increase her payoff from almost 0 to almost 1 in a\n[0,1]-normalized game.

Polarization control in the soft\nX-ray region from linear to circular is highly desirable. Several schemes using\nhelical undulators have been discussed for the LCLS. One consists in replacing\nthree of the last planar undulator segments by APPLE III. A second proposal,\nthe 2nd harmonic helical afterburner, uses short, crossed undulators tuned to\nthe second harmonic. This last scheme is expected to be the better one. Its\nadvantages are a high and stable degree of circular polarization and a low\ncost. Its disadvantage is a small output power and a narrow wavelength range.\nWe propose a novel method to generate 10 GW level power at the fundamental\nharmonic with 99% degree of circular polarization from the LCLS baseline. Its\nmerits are low cost, simplicity and easy implementation. After the baseline\nundulator, the electron beam is sent through a 40 m long straight section, and\nsubsequently passes through a short APPLE II radiator. The microbunch structure\nis easily preserved, and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the helical\nradiator. The background radiation from the baseline undulator is suppressed by\nletting radiation and electrons through horizontal and vertical slits upstream\nthe helical radiator, where the radiation spot size is about ten times larger\nthan the electron bunch transverse size. Using thin Beryllium foils for the\nslits the divergence of the electron beam halo increases by Coulomb scattering,\nbut the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses. The\napplicability of our method is not restricted to the LCLS baseline setup. LCLS\nII or the European XFEL may benefit from this work as well, due to availability\nof sufficiently long free space at the end of undulator tunnel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 06:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-24"}

However, this\nextension relies heavily on mathematical peculiarities of the K3ST model, and\nproviding an analogous augmentation of the general Markov model has thus far\nbeen elusive. In this paper we rectify this shortcoming by showing how to\nextend the general Markov model on trees to to include arbitrary splits; and\neven further to more general network models. This is achieved by exploring the\nalgebra of the generators of the continuous-time Markov chain together with the\n\"splitting\" operator that generates the branching process on phylogenetic\ntrees. For simplicity we proceed by discussing the two state case and note that\nour results are easily extended to more states with little complication.\nIntriguingly, upon restriction of the two state general Markov model to the\nparameter space of the binary symmetric model, our extension is\nindistinguishable from the previous approach only on trees; as soon as any\nincompatible splits are introduced the two approaches give rise to differing\nprobability distributions with disparate structure. Through exploration of a\nsimple example, we give a tentative argument that our approach to extending to\nmore general networks has desirable properties that the previous approaches do\nnot share.

The measurements are carried out using a novel scheme to\nintegrate the two-way coupling between the particle and the incompressible\nsurrounding fluid flow maintained in a high-Reynolds-number turbulent regime.\nThe main idea consists in combining a Fourier pseudo-spectral method for the\nfluid with an immersed-boundary technique to impose the no-slip boundary\ncondition on the surface of the particle. Benchmarking of the code shows a good\nagreement with experimental and numerical measurements from other groups. A\nstudy of the turbulent wake downstream the sphere is also reported. The mean\nvelocity deficit is shown to behave as the inverse of the distance from the\nparticle, as predicted from classical similarity analysis. This law is\nreinterpreted in terms of the principle of \"permanence of large eddies\" that\nrelates infrared asymptotic self-similarity to the law of decay of energy in\nhomogeneous turbulence.\n  The developed method is then used to attack the problem of an upstream flow\nthat is in a developed turbulent regime. It is shown that the average drag\nforce increases as a function of the turbulent intensity and the particle\nReynolds number. This increase is significantly larger than predicted by\nstandard drag correlations based on laminar upstream flows. It is found that\nthe relevant parameter is the ratio of the viscous boundary layer thickness to\nthe dissipation scale of the ambient turbulent flow.

Numerical and\ntheoretical models cannot yet explain the main properties of merger-induced\nstarbursts, including their intensity and their spatial extent. Usually, the\nmechanism invoked in merger-induced starbursts is a global inflow of gas\ntowards the central kpc, resulting in a nuclear starburst. We show here, using\nhigh-resolution AMR simulations and comparing to observations of the gas\ncomponent in mergers, that the triggering of starbursts also results from\nincreased ISM turbulence and velocity dispersions in interacting systems. This\nforms cold gas that are denser and more massive than in quiescent disk\ngalaxies. The fraction of dense cold gas largely increases, modifying the\nglobal density distribution of these systems, and efficient star formation\nresults. Because the starbursting activity is not just from a global compacting\nof the gas to higher average surface densities, but also from higher turbulence\nand fragmentation into massive and dense clouds, merging systems can enter a\ndifferent regime of star formation compared to quiescent disk galaxies. This is\nin quantitative agreement with recent observations suggesting that disk\ngalaxies and starbursting systems are not the low-activity end and\nhigh-activity end of a single regime, but actually follow different scaling\nrelations for their star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 15:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This correlation step is the most computationally\nintensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to be\ndiscovered increases. In this paper we tested two different algorithms (and the\nrelated prototype software) recently developed to solve the correlation problem\nfor objects in geostationary orbit (GEO), including the accurate orbit\ndetermination by full least squares solutions with all six orbital elements.\nBecause of the presence in the GEO region of a significant subpopulation of\nhigh area to mass objects, strongly affected by non-gravitational\nperturbations, it was actually necessary to solve also for dynamical parameters\ndescribing these effects, that is to fit between 6 and 8 free parameters for\neach orbit. The validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from the\nESA Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) at the Teide observatory (Canary Islands).\nWe proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into a\nset of objects with orbits, starting from a sparse time distribution of\nobservations, which would be compatible with a survey capable of covering the\nregion of interest in the sky just once per night. This could result in a\nsignificant reduction of the requirements for a future telescope network, with\nrespect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithm\nfor correlation and orbit determination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 15:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It has been shown that convection in red supergiant stars gives rise\nto large granules causing surface inhomogeneities together with shock waves in\nthe photosphere. The resulting motion of the photocenter (on time scales\nranging from months to years) could possibly have adverse effects on the\nparallax determination with Gaia. Aims. We explore the impact of the\ngranulation on the photocentric and photometric variability. We quantify these\neffects in order to better characterize the error possibly altering the\nparallax. Methods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of convection\nwith CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D to compute\nintensity maps and spectra in the Gaia G band [325-1030 nm]. Results. We\nprovide astrometric and photometric predictions from 3D simulations of RSGs\nthat are used to evaluate the degradation of the astrometric parameters of\nevolved stars derived by Gaia. We show from RHD simulations that a supergiant\nlike Betelgeuse exhibits a photocentric noise characterised by a standard\ndeviation of the order of 0.1 AU. The number of bright giant and supergiant\nstars whose Gaia parallaxes will be altered by the photocentric noise ranges\nfrom a few tens to several thousandths. The degradation of the astrometric fit\ndue to the presence of this photocentric noise will be noticeable up to about 5\nkpc for the brightest supergiants. Moreover, parallaxes of supergiants are\naffected by a error of the order of a few percents. We show that the\nphotocentric noise, as predicted by the 3D simulation, does account for a\nsubstantial part of the supplementary 'cosmic noise' that affects Hipparcos\nmeasurements of Betelgeuse and Antares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 15:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

An\nessential open question is whether the two classes of materials share the same\nessential physics. In both, superconductivity (SC) emerges when an\nantiferromagnetical (AFM) ordered phase is suppressed. However, in cuprates,\nthe repulsive interaction among the electrons is so strong that the parent\ncompounds are \"Mott insulators.\" By contrast, all iron-based parents are\nmetallic. One perspective is that the iron-based parents are weakly correlated\nand that the AFM arises from a strong \"nesting\" of the Fermi surfaces. An\nalternative view is that the electronic correlations in the parents are still\nsufficiently strong to place the system close to the boundary between\nitinerancy and electronic localization. A key strategy to differentiate theses\nviews is to explore whether the iron-based system can be tuned into a Mott\ninsulator. Here we identify an insulating AFM in (Tl,K)FexSe2 by introducing\nFe-vacancies and creating superconductivity in the Fe-planar. With the\nincreasing Fe-content, the AFM order is reduced. When the magnetism is\neliminated, a superconducting phase with Tc as high as 31K (and a Tc onset as\nhigh as 40K) is induced. Our findings indicate that the correlation effect\nplays a crucial role in the iron-based superconductors. (Tl,K)FexSe2,\ntherefore, represents the first Fe-based high temperature superconductor near\nan insulating AFM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2010 15:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}
