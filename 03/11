Therefore, the total cost in smart grid\nshould be jointly optimized with the communication cost. In this paper, a\nprobabilistic mechanism of locational margin price (LMP) is applied and a model\nfor the stochastic evolution of the underlying load which determines the power\nprice is proposed. Based on this framework of power price, the problem of\ndetermining when to inquire the power price is formulated as a Markov decision\nprocess and the corresponding elements, namely the action space, system state\nand reward function, are defined. Dynamic programming is then applied to obtain\nthe optimal strategy. A simpler myopic approach is proposed by comparing the\ncost of communications and the penalty incurred by using the old value of power\nprice. Numerical results show the significant performance gain of the optimal\nstrategy of price inquiry, as well as the near-optimality of the myopic\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 16:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-11"}

The communication between the power supplier and power\ncustomers is a key issue in smart grid. Performance degradation like delay or\noutage may cause significant impact on the stability of the pricing based\ncontrol and thus the reward of smart grid. Therefore, a QoS mechanism is\nproposed for the communication system in smart grid, which incorporates the\nderivation of QoS requirement and applies QoS routing in the communication\nnetwork. For deriving the QoS requirement, the dynamics of power load and the\nload-price mapping are studied. The corresponding impacts of different QoS\nmetrics like delay are analyzed. Then, the QoS is derived via an optimization\nproblem that maximizes the total revenue. Based on the derived QoS requirement,\na simple greedy QoS routing algorithm is proposed for the requirement of high\nspeed routing in smart grid. It is also proven that the proposed greedy\nalgorithm is a $K$-approximation.

If so, it hosts the closest known neutron\nstar, and its existence implies a great abundance of similar systems and a rate\nof white-dwarf neutron-star mergers similar to that of the type Ia supernova\nrate. Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which\nconfirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white\ndwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass, and the other hotter and more\nmassive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling\n(various factors combine to lower the latter by more than two orders of\nmagnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two\nhydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity\ncomponent are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just\npressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to\nrotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid\nrotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically,\nit appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is\nlost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf. This\nsuggests that the massive white dwarf in SDSS 1257+5428 is magnetic as well,\nwith B~10^5 G.

Moreover, the new\nformulation is relevant when interpreting X-ray data. We compare our composite\nisothermal model to the standard beta-model used to fit X-ray observations of\nearly-type galaxies, to determine the value of the NFW scale radius r_s.\nAssuming a 10% stellar baryon fraction, we find that the exclusion of stars\nfrom the gravitational potential leads to (i) an underestimate of r_s by ~80%,\nand to (ii) an overestimate of the enclosed dark matter at r_s by a factor of\n~2, compared to the equivalent beta-model fit results when stars are not taken\ninto account. For higher stellar mass fractions, a beta-model is unable to\naccurately reproduce our solution, indicating that when the observed surface\nbrightness profile of an isolated elliptical galaxy is found to be well fitted\nby a beta-model, the stellar mass fraction cannot be much greater than ~10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 18:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 15:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

All commonly employed dust\nattenuation curves (such as the Calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-law\ncurve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highly\ninclined galaxies. This conclusion rests on the fact that the average FUV-NUV\ncolor varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors such\nas NUV-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. After considering a number of\nmodel variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dust\nextinction feature at 2175A seen in the Milky Way (MW) extinction curve is\nresponsible for the observed trends. Independent of our interpretation, these\nresults imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet is\nsignificantly more complicated than traditionally assumed.

The BrBr partial radial distribution functions of the liquid and\nplastic crystalline phases are almost the same, while CC correlations clearly\ndisplay long range ordering in the latter phase. Orientational correlations\nalso suggest strong similarities between liquid and plastic crystalline phases,\nwhereas the monoclinic phase behaves very differently. Orientations of the\nmolecules are distinct in the ordered phase, whereas in the plastic crystal\ntheir distribution seems to be isotropic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 04:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

All the TM linear\nchains are found to be unstable against the corresponding zigzag structures.\nAll the TM chains, except Nb, Ag and La, have a stable (or metastable) magnetic\nstate in either the linear or zigzag or both structures. Magnetic states appear\nalso in the sufficiently stretched Nb and La linear chains and in the largely\ncompressed Y and La chains. The spin magnetic moments in the Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, W,\nRe chains could be large ($\\geq$1.0 $\\mu_B$/atom). Structural transformation\nfrom the linear to zigzag chains could suppress the magnetism already in the\nlinear chain, induce the magnetism in the zigzag structure, and also cause a\nchange of the magnetic state (ferromagnetic to antiferroamgetic or vice verse).\nThe calculations including the spin-orbit coupling reveal that the orbital\nmoments in the Zr, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir and Pt chains could be\nrather large ($\\geq$0.1 $\\mu_B$/atom). Importantly, large magnetic anisotropy\nenergy ($\\geq$1.0 meV/atom) is found in most of the magnetic TM chains,\nsuggesting that these nanowires could have fascinating applications in\nultrahigh density magnetic memories and hard disks. In particular, giant\nmagnetic anisotropy energy ($\\geq$10.0 meV/atom) could appear in the Ru, Re,\nRh, and Ir chains. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy energy in several\nelongated linear chains could be as large as 40.0 meV/atom. A\nspin-reorientation transition occurs in the Ru, Ir, Ta, Zr, La and Zr, Ru, La,\nTa and Ir linear chains when they are elongated. Remarkably, all the 5$d$ as\nwell as Tc and Pd chains show the colossal magnetic anisotropy (i.e., it is\nimpossible to rotate magnetization into certain directions). Finally, the\nelectronic band structure and density of states of the nanowires have also been\ncalculated in order to understand the electronic origin of the large magnetic\nanisotropy and orbital magnetic moment as well as to estimate the conduction\nelectron spin polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 05:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A multiple-antenna base-station is\nassumed to serve multiple single-antenna users, who quantize and feed back\ntheir channel state information (CSI) through a shared rate-limited feedback\nchannel. The optimization problem is cast in the form of minimizing the average\ntransmission power at the base-station subject to users' target\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) and outage probability\nconstraints. The goal is to derive the feedback bit allocations among the users\nand the corresponding channel magnitude and direction quantization codebooks in\na high-resolution quantization regime. Toward this end, this paper develops an\noptimization framework using approximate analytical closed-form solutions, the\naccuracy of which is then verified by numerical results. The results show that,\nfor channels in the real space, the number of channel direction quantization\nbits should be $(M-1)$ times the number of channel magnitude quantization bits,\nwhere $M$ is the number of base-station antennas. Moreover, users with higher\nrequested quality-of-service (QoS), i.e. lower target outage probabilities, and\nhigher requested downlink rates, i.e. higher target SINR's, should use larger\nshares of the feedback rate. It is also shown that, for the target QoS\nparameters to be feasible, the total feedback bandwidth should scale\nlogarithmically with the geometric mean of the target SINR values and the\ngeometric mean of the inverse target outage probabilities. In particular, the\nminimum required feedback rate is shown to increase if the users' target\nparameters deviate from the corresponding geometric means.

We find that in simulations with radiative\ncooling, star formation and stellar feedback (CSF), intracluster gas outside\nthe cluster core is more spherical compared to non-radiative (NR) simulations,\nwhile in the core the gas in the CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly\noblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settles\ninto a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. The shape of the gas\nin the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas\ncooling. We find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential rather\nwell outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller\nradii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. In the CSF\nruns, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally\nsupported. Interestingly, we find that in NR simulations the difference between\ngas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which make\nthe gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. Finally,\nwe use mock Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observed\nin three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of\nX-ray isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clusters\nagainst observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling of the\nintracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 08:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 13:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

To model\nthe excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG)\napproximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the\nobservations toward the positions where the over-excitation of H13CO+ has\npreviously been observed [i.e. toward L1448- mm at offsets (0,0) and (0,-10)],\nand ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required\nfor the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of\nup to 400 K. We also report several lines of SiO, HN13C and H13CO+ toward new\npositions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the\nover-excitation of the ions in L1448-mm. From the isotopologue observations, we\nfind that the emission of H13CO+ and HN13C from the precursor is optically thin\nif this emission is extended.

The purely elastic behavior obtained at large impact-parameter L,\nthrough duality from disconnected AdS_5 minimal surfaces beyond the\nGross-Ooguri transition point, is combined with unitarity and analyticity\nconstraints in the central region. In this way we obtain an absolute bound on\nthe high-energy behavior of the forward scattering amplitude due to the\ngraviton interaction between minimal surfaces in the bulk. The dominant\n\"Pomeron\" intercept is bounded by alpha less than or equal to 11/7 using the\nAdS/CFT constraint of a weak gravitational field in the bulk. Assuming the\nelastic eikonal approximation in a larger impact-parameter range gives alpha\nbetween 4/3 and 11/7.

This paper\ngoes beyond the description of predicted probability distributions, and\npresents results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an\nexplicitly stochastic context. The method developed is Bayesian.

This is due\nto its broad range of applications, from catalysis to photocatalysis to\nphotovoltaics. Despite this large interest, many of its bulk properties have\nbeen sparsely investigated using either experimental techniques or ab initio\ntheory. Further, some of TiO2's most important properties, such as its\nelectronic band gap, the localized character of excitons, and the localized\nnature of states induced by oxygen vacancies, are still under debate. We\npresent a unified description of the properties of rutile and anatase phases,\nobtained from ab initio state of the art methods, ranging from density\nfunctional theory (DFT) to many body perturbation theory (MBPT) derived\ntechniques.

With this aim we compare TiO2's electronic properties for 0D\nclusters, 1D nanorods, 2D layers, and 3D bulks using different approximations\nwithin DFT and MBPT calculations. While quantum confinement effects lead to a\nwidening of the energy gap, it has been shown that substitutional doping with\nboron or nitrogen gives rise to (meta-)stable structures and the introduction\nof dopant and mid-gap states which effectively reduce the band gap.

The theory of supersonic magnetized\nturbulence, as well as the understanding of projection effects of observed\nquantities, are still in progress. In this work we explore the characterization\nof the turbulent cascade and its damping from observational spectral line\nprofiles. We address the difference of ion and neutral velocities by clarifying\nthe nature of the turbulence damping in the partially ionized. We provide\ntheoretical arguments in favor of the explanation of the larger Doppler\nbroadening of lines arising from neutral species compared to ions as arising\nfrom the turbulence damping of ions at larger scales. Also, we compute a number\nof MHD numerical simulations for different turbulent regimes and explicit\nturbulent damping, and compare both the 3-dimensional distributions of velocity\nand the synthetic line profile distributions. From the numerical simulations,\nwe place constraints on the precision with which one can measure the 3D\ndispersion depending on the turbulence sonic Mach number. We show that no\nuniversal correspondence between the 3D velocity dispersions measured in the\nturbulent volume and minima of the 2D velocity dispersions available through\nobservations exist. For instance, for subsonic turbulence the correspondence is\npoor at scales much smaller than the turbulence injection scale, while for\nsupersonic turbulence the correspondence is poor for the scales comparable with\nthe injection scale. We provide a physical explanation of the existence of such\na 2D-3D correspondence and discuss the uncertainties in evaluating the damping\nscale of ions that can be obtained from observations. However, we show that the\nstatistics of velocity dispersion from observed line profiles can provide the\nspectral index and the energy transfer rate of turbulence. Also, comparing two\nsimilar simulations with different viscous coefficients it was possible to\nconstrain the turbulent cut-off scale. This may especially prove useful since\nit is believed that ambipolar diffusion may be one of the dominant dissipative\nmechanism in star-forming regions. In this case, the determination of the\nambipolar diffusion scale may be used as a complementary method for the\ndetermination of magnetic field intensity in collapsing cores. We discuss the\nimplications of our findings in terms of a new approach to magnetic field\nmeasurement proposed by Li & Houde (2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 15:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

These\nstructures encode geometrical information of the embedding of arbitrary valence\nvertices of a graph in 3-dimensional Riemannian space, and can be represented\nby sign strings containing relative orientations of embedded edges. We\ndemonstrate that these signature factors are a special representation of the\ngeneral mathematical concept of an oriented matroid. Moreover, we show that\noriented matroids can also be used to describe the topology (connectedness) of\ndirected graphs. Hence the mathematical methods developed for oriented matroids\ncan be applied to the difficult combinatorics of embedded graphs underlying the\nconstruction of LQG. As a first application we revisit the analysis of [4-5],\nand find that enumeration of all possible sign configurations used there is\nequivalent to enumerating all realizable oriented matroids of rank 3, and thus\ncan be greatly simplified. We find that for 7-valent vertices having no\ncoplanar triples of edge tangents, the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the\nvolume spectrum does not grow as one increases the maximum spin $\\jmax$ at the\nvertex, for any orientation of the edge tangents. This indicates that, in\ncontrast to the area operator, considering large $\\jmax$ does not necessarily\nimply large volume eigenvalues. In addition we give an outlook to possible\nstarting points for rewriting the combinatorics of LQG in terms of oriented\nmatroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 15:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-22"}

We investigate\nthe emission of jets as a result of repeated reconnection events between\ncolliding magnetic fields. We perform 3D simulations by solving the\ntime-dependent, resistive MHD equations in a highly stratified atmosphere. A\nsmall active region field is constructed by the emergence of a toroidal\nmagnetic flux tube. A current structure is build up and reconnection sets in\nwhen new emerging flux comes into contact with the ambient field of the active\nregion. The topology of the magnetic field around the current structure is\ndrastically modified during reconnection. The modification results in a\nformation of new magnetic systems that eventually collide and reconnect. We\nfind that reconnection jets are taking place in successive recurrent phases in\ndirections perpendicular to each other, while in each phase they release\nmagnetic energy and hot plasma into the solar atmosphere. After a series of\nrecurrent appearance of jets, the system approaches an equilibrium where the\nefficiency of the reconnection is substantially reduced. We deduce that the\nemergence of new magnetic flux introduces a perturbation to the active region\nfield, which in turn causes reconnection between neighboring magnetic fields\nand the release of the trapped energy in the form of jet-like emissions. This\nis the first time that self-consistent recurrency of jets in active regions is\nshown in a three-dimensional experiment of magnetic flux emergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 15:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-12"}

Interferometry resolved this issue by filtering the incoming light\nwith single-mode fibers. Thanks to this technique, we obtained with the IOTA\ninterferometer very precise measurements of the spatial frequencies of seven\nevolved stars. From these measurements, we performed a blind deconvolution to\nrestore an image of the surface of the stars. Six of the them, Betelgeuse, Mu\nCep, R leo, Mira, Chi Cyg and CH Cyg, feature very asymmetrical brightness\ndistributions. On the other hand, the Arcturus data are extremely well fitted\nwith a simple limb-darkened photospheric disc. From the observations of $\\chi$\nCyg, we show that the star is surrounded by a molecular shell undergoing a\nballistic motion. We propose to use the same technique of spatial filtering\nwith single-mode fibers to correct for the effect of turbulence in the pupil of\na telescope. Because the pupil is redundant, this technique does require a\nremapping of the pupil. We developed a dedicated algorithm to show that it was\npossible to reconstruct images at the diffraction limit of the telescope free\nof any speckle noise. Our simulations show that a high dynamic range (over\n10^6) could be obtained in the visible on an 8 meter telescope. A lab\nexperiment is under construction to validate the concept of this new\ninstrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 19:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-18"}

The base flow is\ncharacterised by the cross flow Reynolds number, $R_{inj}$ and the\ndimensionless wall velocity, $k$. Squire's transformation may be applied to the\nlinear stability equations and we therefore consider 2D (spanwise-independent)\nperturbations. Corresponding to each dimensionless wall velocity, $k\\in[0,1]$,\ntwo ranges of $R_{inj}$ exist where unconditional stability is observed. In the\nlower range of $R_{inj}$, for modest $k$ we have a stabilisation of long\nwavelengths leading to a cut-off $R_{inj}$. This lower cut-off results from\nskewing of the velocity profile away from a Poiseuille profile, shifting of the\ncritical layers and the gradual decrease of energy production. Cross-flow\nstabilisation and Couette stabilisation appear to act via very similar\nmechanisms in this range, leading to the potential for robust compensatory\ndesign of flow stabilisation using either mechanism. As $R_{inj}$ is increased,\nwe see first destabilisation and then stabilisation at very large $R_{inj}$.\nThe instability is again a long wavelength mechanism. Analysis of the\neigenspectrum suggests the cause of instability is due to resonant interactions\nof Tollmien-Schlichting waves. A linear energy analysis reveals that in this\nrange the Reynolds stress becomes amplified, the critical layer is irrelevant\nand viscous dissipation is completely dominated by the energy\nproduction/negation, which approximately balances at criticality. The\nstabilisation at very large $R_{inj}$ appears to be due to decay in energy\nproduction, which diminishes like $R_{inj}^{-1}$. Our study is limited to two\ndimensional, spanwise independent perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 07:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-06"}

Moreover, we have measured the colors of several ICL features\nwhich extend beyond M87's outermost reaches and find that they have similar\ncolors to the M87's halo itself, B-V ~ 0.8. The common colors of these features\nsuggests that the extended outer envelopes of cD galaxies, such as M87, may be\nformed from similar streams, created by tidal interactions within the cluster,\nthat have since dissolved into a smooth background in the cluster potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 21:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 10:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
