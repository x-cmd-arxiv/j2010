Our\nobservations are consistent with the jet model presented by \\cite{wilsonetal01}\nin which a cocoon originating from the nuclear jet is shocking the gas in the\ngalaxy disc. Alternatively, our observations are also consistent with the\nbipolar hypershell model of \\cite{Sofue80} and \\cite{SofueandVogler01}.

One-dimensional\n(1D) stellar modeling of this intrinsically multi-dimensional dynamic event is\nlikely to be inadequate. Previous hydrodynamic simulations imply that the\nsingle convection zone in the helium core of metal-rich Pop I stars grows\nduring the flash on a dynamic timescale. This may lead to hydrogen injection\ninto the core, and a double convection zone structure as known from\none-dimensional core helium flash simulations of low-mass Pop III stars. We\nperform hydrodynamic simulations of the core helium flash in two and three\ndimensions to better constrain the nature of these events. To this end we study\nthe hydrodynamics of convection within the helium cores of a 1.25 \\Msun\nmetal-rich Pop I star (Z=0.02), and a 0.85 \\Msun metal-free Pop III star (Z=0)\nnear the peak of the flash.

The hydrodynamic simulation of the Pop I model involving a single\nconvection zone covers 27 hours of stellar evolution, while the first\nhydrodynamic simulations of a double convection zone, in the Pop III model,\nspan 1.8 hours of stellar life. We find differences between the predictions of\nmixing length theory and our hydrodynamic simulations. The simulation of the\nsingle convection zone in the Pop I model shows a strong growth of the size of\nthe convection zone due to turbulent entrainment. Hence we predict that for the\nPop I model a hydrogen injection phase (i.e. hydrogen injection into the helium\ncore) will commence after about 23 days, which should eventually lead to a\ndouble convection zone structure known from 1D stellar modeling of low-mass Pop\nIII stars. Our two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the double\n(Pop III) convection zone model show that the velocity field in the convection\nzones is different from that predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations.\nThe simulations suggest that the double convection zone decays quickly, the\nflow eventually being dominated by internal gravity waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 18:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It uses electrical scattering matrices and\nnoise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and\ncomplexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that\nthe scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are\nanalytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and\nanalysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver\ncomponents can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the\ninstrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and\nnoise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component\nimperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors\nprecisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance,\nallowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections\ncontribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm\nspecifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is\npreferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal\nreflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis\nis unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the\ncomponents can be described by scattering matrices. Of particular interest to\nthe sub-mm and terahertz frequency regime is the choice between coherent and\ndirect detection technologies. Steady improvements in mm and sub-mm Low Noise\nAmplifiers (LNAs) mean that coherent receivers with LNAs as their first active\nelement are becoming increasingly competitive, in terms of sensitivity, with\nbolometer-based receivers at frequencies above ~100 GHz. As an example of the\nutility of SNS, we use it to compare two polarimeter architectures commonly\nused to perform measurements of the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background:\ndifferencing polarimeters, an architecture commonly used in polarization\nsensitive bolometer-based polarimeters; and pseudo-correlation polarimeters, an\narchitecture commonly used in coherent, LNA-based, polarimeters.

In contrast, theories\nof WIMPs with excited states can lead to nuclear recoil spectra that peak at\nfinite recoil energies E_R. The peaks of such signals are typically fairly\nbroad, with Delta E_R/E_peak ~ 1. We show that in the presence of dark matter\nstructures with low velocity dispersion, such as streams or clumps, peaks from\nup-scattering can become extremely narrow with FWHM of a few keV only. This\ndiffers dramatically from the conventionally expected WIMP spectrum and would,\nonce detected, open the possibility to measure the dark matter velocity\nstructure with a fantastic accuracy. As an intriguing example, we confront the\nobserved cluster of 3 events near 42 keV from the CRESST commissioning run with\nthis scenario, and find a wide range of parameters capable for producing such a\npeak. We compare the possible signals at other experiments, and find that such\na particle could also give rise to the signal at DAMA, although not from the\nsame stream. Over some range of parameters a signal would be visible at xenon\nexperiments. We show that such dark matter peaks are a very clear signal, and\ncan be easily disentangled from potential backgrounds, both terrestrial or due\nto WIMP down-scattering, by an enhanced annual modulation signature in both the\namplitude of the signal and its shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 19:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

These\ntechniques are improvements over the classical LSB data hiding technique and\nthe Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. \\cite{r1}.\nThe classical LSB technique is the simplest, but using this technique it is\npossible to embed only in first few bit-planes, since image quality becomes\ndrastically distorted when embedding in higher bit-planes. Battisti et al.\n\\cite{r1} proposed an improvement over this by using Fibonacci decomposition\ntechnique and generating a different set of virtual bit-planes all together,\nthereby increasing the number of bit-planes. In this paper, first we\nmathematically model and generalize this particular approach of virtual\nbit-plane generation. Then we propose two novel embedding techniques, both of\nwhich are special-cases of our generalized model. The first embedding scheme is\nbased on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime numbers, while\nthe second one is based on decomposition in sum of natural numbers. Each of\nthese particular representations generates a different set of (virtual)\nbit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one\nto embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much\ndistortion, with a much better stego-image quality, in a reliable and secured\nmanner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A comparative\nperformance study between the classical Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the\ndata hiding technique using Fibonacci -p-Sequence decomposition and our\nproposed schemes has been done. Theoretical analysis indicates that image\nquality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using Fibonacci\ndecomposition improves against simple LSB substitution method, while the same\nusing the prime decomposition method improves drastically against that using\nFibonacci decomposition technique, and finally the natural number decomposition\nmethod is a further improvement against that using prime decomposition\ntechnique. Also, optimality for the last technique is proved. For both of our\ndata-hiding techniques, the experimental results show that, the stego-image is\nvisually indistinguishable from the original cover image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 20:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-22"}

Here, we\ninvestigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character\nof the spatiotemporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical\nsystems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the\ncorrelation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in\nspace at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function\nextracted from resting-state fMRI data exhibits self-similarity in space and\ntime. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive\nspatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency\nbehavior of the power spectrum. The uncovered dynamical self-similarity implies\nthat the brain is spontaneously at a continuously changing (in space and time)\nintermediate state between two extremes, one of excessive cortical integration\nand the other of complete segregation.

The social space is modeled with an agent network, where each agent\nstands for a member of the community and has knowledge about expertise and\npersonal characteristics of some other members.

Near-infrared observations with Subaru/MOIRCS provided a clear\ndetection of afterglow in Ks band, although no optical counterpart was\nreported. The flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to X-ray bands of the\nafterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to the\nafterglow is Av = 2.7 - 10 mag. This large extinction is probably the major\nreason for optical faintness of GRB 080325. The J - Ks color of the host\ngalaxy, (J - Ks = 1.3 in AB magnitude), is significantly redder than those for\ntypical GRB hosts previously identified. In addition to J and Ks bands, optical\nimages in B, Rc, i', and z' bands with Subaru/Suprime-Cam were obtained at\nabout one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host is\nestimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. The host luminosity is comparable to L^{*} at\nz \\sim 2 in contrast to the sub-L^{*} property of typical GRB hosts at lower\nredshifts. The best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host shows\nthat a large dust extinction (Av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of the\nhost and that the host galaxy is massive (M_{*} = 7.0 \\times 10^{10} Msun)\nwhich is one of the most massive GRB hosts previously identified. By assuming\nthat the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \\sim 2 is\napplicable for the GRB host, this large stellar mass suggests the high\nmetallicity environment around GRB 080325, consistent with inferred large\nextinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 05:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 09:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In particular we calculate\nthe SZ angular power spectrum and the central temperature decrement. The effect\nof magnetic fields is included in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation by\nsplitting the Lorentz force into two terms one being the force due to magnetic\npressure which acts outwards and the other being magnetic tension which acts\ninwards. A perturbative approach is adopted to solve for the gas density\nprofile for weak magnetic fields (< 4 micro G}). This leads to an enhancement\nof the gas density in the central regions for nearly radial magnetic field\nconfigurations. Previous works had considered the force due to magnetic\npressure alone which is the case only for a special set of field\nconfigurations. However, we see that there exists possible sets of\nconfigurations of ICM magnetic fields where the force due to magnetic tension\nwill dominate. Subsequently, this effect is extrapolated for typical field\nstrengths (~ 10 micro G) and scaling arguments are used to estimate the angular\npower due to secondary anisotropies at cluster scales. In particular we find\nthat it is possible to explain the excess power reported by CMB experiments\nlike CBI, BIMA, ACBAR at l > 2000 with sigma_8 ~ 0.8 (WMAP 5 year data) for\ntypical cluster magnetic fields. In addition we also see that the magnetic\nfield effect on the SZ temperature decrement is more pronounced for low mass\nclusters (<T> ~ 2 keV). Future SZ detections of low mass clusters at few arc\nsecond resolution will be able to probe this effect more precisely. Thus, it\nwill be instructive to explore the implications of this model in greater detail\nin future works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 06:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In general, hindered motion\ngives rise to anomalous transport, though the nature of the onset of this\nbehavior is still under debate and difficult to investigate experimentally.\nHere, we present a systematic study where proteins bound to supported lipid\nmembranes diffuse freely in two dimensions, but are increasingly hindered by\nthe presence of other like proteins. In our model system, the surface coverage\nof the protein avidin on the lipid bilayer is well controlled by varying the\nconcentration of biotinylated lipid anchors. Using fluorescence correlation\nspectroscopy (FCS), we measure the time correlation function over long times\nand convert it to the mean-square displacement of the diffusing proteins. Our\napproach allows for high precision data and a clear distinction between\nanomalous and normal diffusion. It enables us to investigate the onset of\nanomalous diffusion, which takes place when the area coverage of membrane\nproteins increases beyond approximately 5%. This transition region exhibits\npronounced spatial heterogeneities. Increasing the packing fraction further,\ntransport becomes more and more anomalous, manifested in a decrease of the\nexponent of subdiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 09:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

Spectra of 147 sources are presented and classified.\nBackground stars (with slope consistent with a reddened stellar spectrum and\nsilicate features in absorption), galaxies (with redshifted PAH features) and a\nplanetary nebula (with high ionization lines) amount to 22% of contamination in\nthis sample, leaving 115 true YSOs.

The\npresence, strength and shape of these silicate features are used to infer disk\nproperties for these systems. About 8% of the disks have 30/13 micron flux\nratios consistent with cold disks with inner holes or gaps, and 3% of the disks\nshow PAH emission.

At this distance the\ngalaxy census is complete to Mi=-17.5 mag, i.e. approx 4 mag fainter than M*.\nThe morphological classification of galaxies into early- (ellipticals) and\nlate-types (spirals) was carried out by inspection of individual SDSS images\nand spectra. The density around each galaxies was determined in cylinders of 1\nMpc radius and 1000 km s^-1 half length. The color-luminosity relation was\nderived for galaxies in bins morphological type and in four thresholds of\ngalaxy density-contrast, ranging from delta{1,1000} <= 0 (UL = the cosmic web);\n0 < delta{1,1000} <= 4 (L = the loose groups); 4 < delta{1,1000} <= 20 (H = the\nlarge groups and the cluster's outskirts) and delta{1,1000} > 20 (UH = the\ncluster's cores). The fraction of early-type galaxies increases with the log of\nthe over-density. A well defined \"red sequence\" composed of early-type galaxies\nexists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity\n(dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity\nisolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low\nluminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters\nand groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions.\nAt z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment\n(Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star\nforming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into\namorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The\nmechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping,\nwithout significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This\nprocess is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the\nhighest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star\nformation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of\npost-star-burst in galaxy spectra. PSB galaxies, that are in fact found\nsignificantly clustered around the largest dynamical units, represent the\nremnants of star forming isolated galaxies that had their star formation\nviolently suppressed during their infall in clusters in the last 0.5-1.5 Gyrs,\nand the progenitors of future dEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 14:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Since such a co-eval system with common age and composition\nprovides crucial information of this special transition phase, we monitored the\nsystem over 3 years to derive first orbital parameters and dynamical mass\nestimates, as well as a spectral type determination. We obtained resolved high\nangular resolution, near-IR images with HST and the adaptive optics instrument\nNACO at the VLT including the laser guide star system PARSEC. Based on two\nepochs of astrometric data we derive a minimum semi-major axis of 5.2 +- 0.8\nAU. The assumption of a face-on circular orbit yields an orbital period of 72\n+- 4 years and a total system mass of 30-60 Mjup. This places the masses of the\nindividual components of the system at the lower end of the mass regime of\nbrown dwarfs. The achieved photometry allowed a first spectral type\ndetermination of L9 +- 1 for each component. In addition, this seems to be only\nthe fifth resolved L/T transition binary with a flux reversal. While ultimate\nexplanations for this effect are still owing, the 2MASS J03105986+1648155\nsystem adds an important benchmark object for improving our understanding of\nthis remarkable evolutionary phase of brown dwarfs. Additionally, the\nobservational results of 2MASS J03105986+1648155 AB derived with the new PARSEC\nAO system at the VLT show the importance of this technical capability. The\nupdated AO system allows us to significantly extend the sample of brown dwarfs\nobservable with high-resolution from the ground and hence to reveal more of\ntheir physical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 15:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Ultrafast electron\ncrystallography (UEC) offers, through observation of spatio-temporally resolved\ndiffraction, the means for determining structural dynamics and the possible\nrole of electron-lattice interaction. A polarized femtosecond (fs) laser pulse\nexcites the charge carriers, which relax through electron-electron and\nelectron-phonon coupling, and the consequential structural distortion is\nfollowed diffracting fs electron pulses. In this review, the recent findings\nobtained on cuprates are summarized. In particular, we discuss the strength and\nsymmetry of the directional electron-phonon coupling in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\\delta\n(BSCCO), as well as the c-axis structural instability induced by near-infrared\npulses in La2CuO4 (LCO). The theoretical implications of these results are\ndiscussed with focus on the possibility of charge stripes being significant in\naccounting for the polarization anisotropy of BSCCO, and cohesion energy\n(Madelung) calculations being descriptive of the c-axis instability in LCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 15:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-14"}

The electrical conductivity of a volatile\nenriched liquid alloy can be substantially lower than a light-element-depleted\nfluid found close to the inner core boundary. In this paper, we investigate the\neffect of radially variable electrical conductivity on planetary dynamo action\nusing an electrical conductivity that decreases exponentially as a function of\nradius. We find that numerical solutions with continuous, radially outward\ndecreasing electrical conductivity profiles result in strongly modified flow\nand magnetic field dynamics, compared to solutions with homogeneous electrical\nconductivity. The force balances at the top of the simulated fluid determine\nthe overall character of the flow. The relationship between Coriolis and\nLorentz forces near the outer boundary controls the flow and magnetic field\nintensity and morphology of the system. Our results imply that a low\nconductivity layer near the top of Mercury's liquid outer core is consistent\nwith its weak magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 15:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

The sample of radio sources are selected from\nthe catalogue of Kimball & Ivezi\\'c (2008) with flux densities at 325, 1400 and\n4850 MHz, using WENSS, NVSS and GB6 radio surveys and from flux measurements at\n74 MHz taken from VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey \\citep{cohen}. We study\nradiogalaxy spectral properties using radio colour-colour diagrams and find\nthat our sample follows a single power law from 74 to 4850 MHz. The spectral\nindex vs. spectroscopic redshift relation ($\\alpha-z$) is not significant for\nour sample of radio sources. We analyze a subsample of radio sources associated\nwith clusters of galaxies identified from the maxBCG catalogue and find that\nabout 40% of radio sources with ultra steep spectra (USS, $\\alpha<-1$, where\n$S_\\nu \\propto \\nu^{\\alpha}$) are associated with galaxy clusters or groups of\ngalaxies. We construct a Hubble diagram of USS radio sources in the optical $r$\nband up to $z\\sim0$.8 and compare our results with those for normal galaxies\nselected from different optical surveys and find that USS radio sources are\naround as luminous as the central galaxies in the maxBCG cluster sample and\ntypically more than 4 magnitudes brighter than normal galaxies at $z\\sim0$.3.\nWe study correlations between spectral index, richness and luminosity of\nclusters associated with radio sources. We find that USS at low redshift are\nrare, most of them reside in regions of unusually high ambient density, such of\nthose found in rich cluster of galaxies. Our results also suggest that clusters\nof galaxies associated with steeper than the average spectra have higher\nrichness counts and are populated by luminous galaxies in comparison with those\nenvironments associated to radio sources with flatter than the average spectra.\nA plausible explanation for our results is that radio emission is more pressure\nconfined in higher gas density environments such as those found in rich\nclusters of galaxies and as a consequence radio lobes in rich galaxy clusters\nwill expand adiabatically and lose energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nlosses, resulting in a steeper radio spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 20:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In particular\nthere has been considerable interest in their use in tackling problems arising\nin the areas of scheduling and timetabling. However, the classical genetic\nalgorithm paradigm is not well equipped to handle constraints and successful\nimplementations usually require some sort of modification to enable the search\nto exploit problem specific knowledge in order to overcome this shortcoming.\nThis paper is concerned with the development of a family of genetic algorithms\nfor the solution of a nurse rostering problem at a major UK hospital. The\nhospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of\nnurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to\nfulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes\nand qualifications have to be taken into account. The schedules must also be\nseen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all\nnurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for\nsenior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic\nalgorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover,\nsingle-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of\nall schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the\nremaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the\nfitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the\nproblem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the\nshortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing\nfeasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as\nmeasured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving\nparameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill\nclimbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it\nwill be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these\ndifficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to\nmeasure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm\nis able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the\nhospital. The talk will conclude with some observations as to the overall\nquality of this approach to this and similar problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 11:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}
