The above scaling relation allows to\ncontrol experimentally the chemical potential, independently of all other\nHamiltonian parameters, via trap squeezing; given that the global chemical\npotential coincides with the local chemical potential in the trap center,\nmeasurements of the central density as a function of the chemical potential\ngives access to the information on the bulk compressibility of the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. Supplemented with time-of-flight measurements of the coherence\nproperties, the measurement of compressibility enables one to discern among the\nvarious possible phases realized by bosons in an optical lattice with or\nwithout external (periodic or random) potentials -- e.g. superfluid, Mott\ninsulator, band insulator, and Bose glass.

In\nnon-premixed flows the beta distribution has been a convenient choice to\nrepresent the mixture fraction in binary mixtures or a progress variable in\ncombustion. Here the beta-pdf approach is extended to variable-density mixing:\nmixing between materials that have very large density differences and thus the\nscalar fields are active. As a consequence, new mixing phenomena arise due to\n1) cubic non-linearities in the Navier-Stokes equation, 2) additional\nnon-linearities in the molecular diffusion terms and 3) the appearance of the\nspecific volume as a dynamical variable. The assumed beta-pdf approach is\nextended to transported pdf methods by giving the associated stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE). The beta distribution is shown to be a realizable,\nconsistent and sufficiently general representation of the marginal pdf of the\nfluid density, an active scalar, in non-premixed variable-density turbulent\nmixing. The moment equations derived from mass conservation are compared to the\nmoment equations derived from the governing SDE. This yields a series of\nrelations between the non-stationary coefficients of the SDE and the mixing\nphysics. Our treatment of this problem is general: the mixing is mathematically\nrepresented by the divergence of the velocity field which can only be specified\nonce the problem is defined. In this paper we seek to describe a theoretical\nframework to subsequent applications. We report and document several rigorous\nmathematical results, necessary for forthcoming work that deals with the\napplications of the current results to model specification, computation and\nvalidation of binary mixing of inert fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 02:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 14:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 17:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}

The\nrotating reference system is constructed as an infinite set of Frenet-Seret\ntetrads defined so that the detector is at rest in a tetrad at each proper\ntime. Correlation functions, more exactly their frequency spectrum, contain the\nPlanck thermal factor, and the energy density the rotating detector observes is\nproportional to the sum of energy densities of Planck's spectrum at the\ntemperature T_rot = \\hbar \\Omega / (2 \\pi k_B) and zero-point radiation. The\nproportionality factor is (2/3)(4\\gamma^2 - 1) for an electromagnetic field and\n(2/9)(4\\gamma^2 - 1) for a massless scalar field, where \\gamma = (1 - (\\Omega\nr/c)^2)^(-1/2), and r is a detector rotation radius. The origin of these\nthermal effects is the periodicity of the correlation functions and their\ndiscrete spectrum, both following rotation with angular velocity \\Omega. The\nthermal energy can also be interpreted as a source of a vacuum force, f_vac,\napplied to the rotating detector from the vacuum field. The f_vac depends on\nthe size of neither the charge nor the mass, like the force in the Casimir\nmodel for a charged particle, but, contrary to the last one, it is directed to\nthe center of the circular orbit. The f_vac infinitely grows by magnitude when\nr \\to r_0 = c/\\Omega, with a fixed \\Omega. The orbits with a radius greater\nthan r_0 do not exist simply because the returning vacuum force becomes\ninfinite. On the uttermost orbit with the radius r_0, a linear velocity of the\nrotating particle would have become c. The f_vac becomes very small and\nproportional to r when r is small, r << c/\\aOmega. Such vacuum force dependence\non radius, at large and small r, can be associated respectively with so called\nconfinement and asymptotic freedom, known in QCD, and provide a new explanation\nfor them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 04:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 12:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-31"}

In FastSLAM, particle filter is used for the\nmobile robot pose (position and orientation) estimation, and an Extended Kalman\nFilter (EKF) is used for the feature location's estimation. However, FastSLAM\ndegenerates over time. This degeneracy is due to the fact that a particle set\nestimating the pose of the robot loses its diversity. One of the main reasons\nfor loosing particle diversity in FastSLAM is sample impoverishment. It occurs\nwhen likelihood lies in the tail of the proposal distribution. In this case,\nmost of particle weights are insignificant. Another problem of FastSLAM relates\nto the design of an extended Kalman filter for landmark position's estimation.\nThe performance of the EKF and the quality of the estimation depends heavily on\ncorrect a priori knowledge of the process and measurement noise covariance\nmatrices (Q and R) that are in most applications unknown. On the other hand, an\nincorrect a priori knowledge of Q and R may seriously degrade the performance\nof the Kalman filter. This paper presents a Neuro-Fuzzy Multi Swarm FastSLAM\nFramework. In our proposed method, a Neuro-Fuzzy extended kalman filter for\nlandmark feature estimation, and a particle filter based on particle swarm\noptimization are presented to overcome the impoverishment of FastSLAM.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 06:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

Despite\nthe advantages of aspect-oriented concepts regarding modularity, the implicit\nnature of the aspect weaving operation may also introduce issues when reasoning\nabout the system behavior. Since in AOGGs aspect weaving is characterized by\nmeans of rule-based rewriting, we can overcome these problems by using known\nanalysis techniques from the graph transformation literature to study aspect\ncomposition.

The ESO SN Ia Progenitor Survey (SPY) aims at finding merging double\ndegenerate binaries as candidates for supernova type Ia (SN Ia) explosions. A\nwhite dwarf merger has also been suggested to explain the formation of rare\ntypes of stars like R CrB, extreme helium or He sdO stars. Here we present the\nhot subdwarf B binary GD 687, which will merge in less than a Hubble time.\n  Methods. The orbital parameters of the close binary have been determined from\ntime resolved spectroscopy. Since GD 687 is a single-lined binary, the spectra\ncontain only information about the subdwarf primary and its orbit. From high\nresolution spectra the projected rotational velocity was derived. Assuming\norbital synchronisation, the inclination of the system and the mass of the\nunseen companion were constrained.\n  Results. The derived inclination is $i=39.3^{+6.2}_{-5.6}\\,^{\\circ}$.

Numerically solving these equations are\nchallenging due to the nonlinear stiff collision (source) terms induced by\nsmall mean free or relaxation time. We study an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time\ndiscretization in which the convection is explicit while the relaxation term is\nimplicit to overcome the stiffness. We first show how the implicit relaxation\ncan be solved explicitly, and then prove asymptotically that this time\ndiscretization drives the density distribution toward the local Maxwellian when\nthe mean free time goes to zero while the numerical time step is held fixed.\nThis naturally imposes an asymptotic-preserving scheme in the Euler limit. The\nscheme so designed does not need any nonlinear iterative solver for the\nimplicit relaxation term. Moreover, it can capture the macroscopic fluid\ndynamic (Euler) limit even if the small scale determined by the Knudsen number\nis not numerically resolved.

Such a term is related to a\nbackground closed 3-form H on the target space. More exactly, the sigma-model\nFeynman amplitudes of classical fields are associated to a bundle gerbe with\nconnection of curvature H over the target space. Under conditions that were\nunraveled more than twenty years ago, the classical amplitudes may be coupled\nto the topologically trivial gauge fields of the symmetry group in a way which\nassures infinitesimal gauge invariance. We show that the resulting gauged\nWess-Zumino amplitudes may, nevertheless, exhibit global gauge anomalies that\nwe fully classify. The general results are illustrated on the example of the\nWZW and the coset models of conformal field theory. The latter are shown to be\ninconsistent in the presence of global anomalies. We introduce a notion of\nequivariant gerbes that allow an anomaly-free coupling of the Wess-Zumino\namplitudes to all gauge fields, including the ones in non-trivial principal\nbundles. The obstructions to the existence of equivariant gerbes and their\nclassification are discussed. The choice of different equivariant structures on\nthe same bundle gerbe gives rise to a new type of discrete-torsion ambiguities\nin the gauged amplitudes.

We focus on\nthe occurrence of Stommel's retention zones, and on the splitting of their\nseparatrices. The goal of this paper is to analyze under which conditions these\nretention zones can form, and under which conditions they can break and induce\nchaotic particle settling. The terminal velocity of the particle in still fluid\nis of the order of the typical velocity of the flow, and the particle response\ntime is much smaller than the typical flow time-scale. It is observed that if\nthe flow is steady and has an upward streamline where the vertical velocity has\na strict local maximum, then inertialess particle trajectories can take locally\nthe form of elliptic Stommel cells, provided the particle terminal velocity is\nclose enough to the local peak flow velocity. These structures only depend on\nthe local flow topology and do not require the flow to have closed streamlines\nor stagnation points. If, in addition, the flow is submitted to a weak\ntime-periodic perturbation, classical expansions enable one to write the\nparticle dynamics as a hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom, plus a\nperturbation containing both the dissipative terms of the particle motion\nequation and the flow unsteadiness. Melnikov's method therefore provides\naccurate criteria to predict the splitting of the separatrices of the elliptic\ncell mentioned above, leading to chaotic particle trapping and chaotic\nsettling. The effect of particle inertia and flow unsteadiness on the\noccurrence of simple zeros in Melnikov's function is discussed. Particle motion\nin a plane cellular flow and in a vertical pipe is then investigated to\nillustrate these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 13:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

The reason for this is\nnot only that individual analyses of single stars are rather time consuming,\nbut more importantly that these large volumes of observations open the\npossibility to do population studies on large samples of stars and such\npopulation studies demand a consistent analysis. By consistent analysis we\nunderstand an analysis that can be performed without the need to make any\nsubjective choices on e.g. mode identification and an analysis where the\nuncertainties are calculated in a consistent way.\n  Here we present a set of automated asterosesimic analysis tools. The main\nengine of these set of tools is an algorithm for modelling the autocovariance\nspectra of the stellar acoustic spectra allowing us to measure not only the\nfrequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation, but also the\nsmall frequency separation and potentially the mean rotational rate and the\ninclination.\n  The measured large and small frequency separations and the frequency of\nmaximum power are used as input to an algorithm that estimates fundamental\nstellar parameters such as mass, radius, luminosity, effective temperature,\nsurface gravity and age based on grid modeling.\n  All the tools take into account the window function of the observations which\nmeans that they work equally well for space-based photometry observations from\ne.g. the NASA Kepler satellite and ground-based velocity observations from e.g.\nthe ESO HARPS spectrograph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 14:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With\nregard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential.

With regard to service,\nhigh value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that\nrepositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated\nservices supporting the production of new knowledge. Along these lines,\nchallenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three\nkey dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of\nservices; and c) preservation of content and sustainability of service.

By studying one of the most massive\nand dense star-forming regions in the Galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc,\nthe filament containing the well-known sources DR21 and DR21(OH), we expect to\nfind observational signatures that allow to discriminate between the two views.\nWe use molecular line data from our 13CO 1-0, CS 2-1, and N2H+ 1-0 survey of\nthe Cygnus X region obtained with the FCRAO and high-angular resolution\nobservations of CO, CS, HCO+, N2H+, and H2CO, obtained with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope.
