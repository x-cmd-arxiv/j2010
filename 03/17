In order to better characterize\nthe properties of their embedded cores, we have obtained new 24um, 60-100um,\nand sub-millimeter continuum data toward a sample of 38 IRDCs. The 24um Spitzer\nimages reveal that while the IRDCs remain dark, many of the cores are\nassociated with bright 24um emission sources, which suggests that they contain\none or more embedded protostars. Combining the 24um, 60-100um, and\nsub-millimeter continuum data, we have constructed broadband spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) for 157 of the cores within these IRDCs and, using simple\ngray-body fits to the SEDs, have estimated their dust temperatures,\nemissivities, opacities, bolometric luminosities, masses and densities. Based\non their Spitzer/IRAC 3-8um colors and the presence of 24um point source\nemission, we have separated cores that harbor active, high-mass star formation\nfrom cores that are quiescent. The active `protostellar' cores typically have\nwarmer dust temperatures and higher bolometric luminosities than the more\nquiescent, perhaps `pre-protostellar', cores. Because the mass distributions of\nthe populations are similar, however, we speculate that the active and\nquiescent cores may represent different evolutionary stages of the same\nunderlying population of cores. Although we cannot rule out low-mass\nstar-formation in the quiescent cores, the most massive of them are excellent\ncandidates for the `high-mass starless core' phase, the very earliest in the\nformation of a high-mass star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 17:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Specifically, when the channel being simulated is\nnoiseless, this reduces to the zero-error capacity of the channel, assisted by\nthe various classes of non-signalling correlations.

The most striking result of this kind is that entanglement can\nassist in zero-error communication, in stark contrast to the standard setting\nof communicaton with asymptotically vanishing error in which entanglement does\nnot help at all.

Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo\nmass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus\non the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central\ngalaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes\nthan blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar\nmass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and\nblue centrals, especially for M* $\\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} Msun. This indicates\nthat stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity.\nNevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is\nnon-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of\nstellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue\ncentrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results\nfrom other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a\nSDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, and\nfrom subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques\nyield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within\na factor of two), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable\ndescription of the galaxy-dark matter connection.

His philosophy was\na variety of Platonism, in which Pauli's affiliation with Carl Jung formed an\nintegral part, but Pauli's philosophical explorations in physics appeared\nbefore he met Jung. Jung validated Pauli's psycho-philosophical perspective.\nThus, the roots of Pauli's physics and philosophy are important in the history\nof modern physics. In his early physics, Pauli attempted to ground his\ntheoretical physics in positivism. He then began instead to trust his intuitive\nvisualizations of entities that formed an underlying reality to the sensible\nphysical world. These visualizations included holistic kernels of\nmathematical-physical entities that later became for him synonymous with Jung's\nmandalas. I have connected Pauli's visualization patterns in physics during the\nperiod 1900 to 1930 to the psychological philosophy of Jung and displayed some\nexamples of Pauli's creativity in the development of quantum mechanics. By\nlooking at Pauli's early physics and philosophy, we gain insight into Pauli's\ncontributions to quantum mechanics. His exclusion principle, his influence on\nWerner Heisenberg in the formulation of matrix mechanics, his emphasis on firm\nlogical and empirical foundations, his creativity in formulating electron\nspinors, his neutrino hypothesis, and his dialogues with other quantum\nphysicists, all point to Pauli being the dominant genius in the development of\nquantum theory. Because Pauli was in a difficult individuation process during\nhis early years, his own writings on philosophy tend to be sparse and often\ncontradictory. My analysis of Pauli's physics and philosophy is based upon\npublished and unpublished sources, and Pauli's later reflections. A pattern has\nemerged. Pauli changed his mind from relying on high rationality and\nempiricism, to valuing intuitive metaphysical visualizations. This coupled with\ndisturbing events in his life precipitated a breakdown and led Pauli to seek\ntreatment at the Jung Clinic. Pauli's psychological tension diminished after\n1932. His physics consistently involved symmetry and invariants. His philosophy\nallied with Jung's resembled a Platonism of combined psyche and physics. Pauli\nsought a rational unification and foundation for his philosophy, but that goal\nwas cut short by his untimely death at the age of 58.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 19:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}

The HI\nextends for a total of ~15kpc. The data, combined with a titled-ring model of\nthe disk, allow to conclude that the kinematics of the HI is that of a\nregularly rotating, highly warped structure down to the nuclear scale. The\nparameters (in particular the inclination) of our model are somewhat different\nfrom some of the previously proposed models but consistent with what was\nrecently derived from stellar light in a central ring. The model nicely\ndescribes also the morphology of the dust lane as observed with Spitzer. There\nare no indications that large-scale anomalies in the kinematics exist that\ncould be related to supplying material for the AGN. Large-scale radial motions\ndo exist, but these are only present at larger radii r>6kpc). This unsettled\ngas is mainly part of a tail/arm like structure. The relatively regular\nkinematics of the gas in this structure suggests that it is in the process of\nsettling down into the main disk. The presence of this structure further\nsupports the merger/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. From the structure\nand kinematics we estimate a timescale of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merging\nevent. No bar structure is needed to describe the kinematics of the HI. The\ncomparison of the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure and those\nof the radio structure together with the relative regularity of the HI down to\nthe sub-kpc regions does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between the\nmerger and the phase of radio activity.

This means that the blueshifted absorption\ndiscovered earlier and discussed in our previous paper cannot be caused by\nout-moving gas at large radius projected onto the centre. Therefore, the\ninterpretation of the blueshifted absorption, together with at least a fraction\nof the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence for a regular inner disk,\nstill holds.

This is inadequate for situations where collisions with this background\nplasma are not completely dominant, as may be the case in, for example,\nlow-density coronal sources. We aim to formulate a model of a self-interacting,\nentirely fast electron population in the absence of a dense background plasma,\nto investigate its implications for observed bremsstrahlung spectra and the\nflare energy budget. We derive approximate expressions for the time-dependent\ndistribution function of the fast electrons using a Fokker-Planck approach. We\nuse these expressions to generate synthetic bremsstrahlung X-ray spectra as\nwould be seen from a corresponding coronal source. We find that our model\nqualitatively reproduces the observed behaviour of some flares. As the flare\nprogresses, the model's initial power-law spectrum is joined by a lower energy,\nthermal component. The power-law component diminishes, and the growing thermal\ncomponent proceeds to dominate the total emission over timescales consistent\nwith flare observations. The power-law exhibits progressive spectral hardening,\nas is seen in some flare coronal sources. We also find that our model requires\na factor of 7 - 10 fewer accelerated electrons than the cold, thick target\nmodel to generate an equivalent hard X-ray flux. This model forms the basis of\na treatment of self-interactions among flare fast electrons, a process which\naffords a more efficient means to produce bremsstrahlung photons and so may\nreduce the efficiency requirements placed on the particle acceleration\nmechanism. It also provides a useful description of the thermalisation of fast\nelectrons in coronal sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 22:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 14:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

To compare the results with the observations, we also computed\ntransmitted X-ray spectra based on the wind solution.

Consequently, the model fails\nto predict spectra with line absorption as strong and as blueshifted as those\nobserved. However, despite the thermal wind being weak and Compton thin, the\nratio between the mass-loss rate and the mass accretion rate is about seven.\nThis high ratio is insensitive to the accretion luminosity, in the limit of\nlower luminosities. Most of the mass is lost from the disk between 0.07 and 0.2\nof the Compton radius. We discovered that beyond this range the wind solution\nis self-similar.

We establish observationally\nmotivated constraints on the mass and radii of these haloes using a variety of\nindependent arguments. First, the observed dispersion measure of pulsars in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the hot halo around the Milky\nWay: if it obeys the standard NFW profile, it must contain less than 4-5% of\nthe missing baryons from the Galaxy. This is similar to other upper limits on\nthe Galactic hot halo, such as the soft X-ray background and the pressure\naround high velocity clouds. Second, we note that the X-ray surface brightness\nof hot haloes with NFW profiles around large isolated galaxies is high enough\nthat such emission should be observed, unless their haloes contain less than\n10-25% of their missing baryons. Third, we place constraints on the column\ndensity of hot haloes using nondetections of OVII absorption along AGN\nsightlines: in general they must contain less than 70% of the missing baryons\nor extend to no more than 40 kpc. Flattening the density profile of galactic\nhot haloes weakens the surface brightness constraint so that a typical L$_*$\ngalaxy may hold half its missing baryons in its halo, but the OVII constraint\nremains unchanged, and around the Milky Way a flattened profile may only hold\n$6-13%$ of the missing baryons from the Galaxy ($2-4 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$). We also show that AGN and supernovae at low to moderate redshift -\nthe theoretical sources of winds responsible for driving out the missing\nbaryons - do not produce the expected correlations with the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relationship and so are insufficient to explain the missing\nbaryons from galaxies. We conclude that most of missing baryons from galaxies\ndo not lie in hot haloes around the galaxies, and that the missing baryons\nnever fell into the potential wells of protogalaxies in the first place. They\nmay have been expelled from the galaxies as part of the process of galaxy\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 23:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

The design is scalable:\nall species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single\ntest tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which\nis a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the\nconcentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of\ninput species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The\ndesign is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as\nhigh or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a\nsingle-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the\ndifference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the\ncircuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital\nabstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is\nenergy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0\nconcentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal\nconcentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic)\nequilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until\nthe input again changes.\n  Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided\nnon-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy\nmust be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at\nsteady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are\npermanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not \"generic\"; each gate\nin the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence\ndifferent circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we\nrequire input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an\ninput of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by\nthe presence of another. That is, we do not construct a \"true NOT gate\" that\nsets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration\nis low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive,\ndigital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of\nthese problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually\nincompatible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 23:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 01:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It is known that the system with more\nthan two planets becomes unstable after remaining quasi-stable for long times,\nleading to highly eccentric orbital motions or ejections of some of the\nplanets. In this paper, we are concerned with the underlying physics for this\nquasi-stability as well as the subsequent instability and advocate the\nso-called \"stagnant motion\" in the phase space, which has been explored in the\nfield of dynamical system. We employ the Lyapunov exponent, the power spectra\nof orbital elements and the distribution of the durations of quasi-stable\nmotions to analyze the phase space structure of the three-planet system, the\nsimplest and hopefully representative one that shows the instability. We find\nfrom the Lyapunov exponent that the system is almost non-chaotic in the initial\nquasi-stable state whereas it becomes intermittently chaotic thereafter. The\nnon-chaotic motions produce the horizontal dense band in the action-angle plot\nwhereas the voids correspond to the chaotic motions. We obtain power laws for\nthe power spectra of orbital eccentricities. Power-law distributions are also\nfound for the durations of quasi-stable states. All these results combined\ntogether, we may reach the following picture: the phase space consists of the\nso-called KAM tori surrounded by satellite tori and imbedded in the chaotic\nsea. The satellite tori have a self-similar distribution and are responsible\nfor the scale-free power-law distributions of the duration times. The system is\ntrapped around one of the KAM torus and the satellites for a long time (the\nstagnant motion) and moves to another KAM torus with its own satellites from\ntime to time, corresponding to the intermittent chaotic behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 06:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In the positive pressure case ($1 < \\gamma < 2$), there\nis no such solution when the black hole is attached to an exact Friedmann\nbackground via a sonic point. However, it has been claimed that there is a\none-parameter family of asymptotically Friedmann black hole solutions providing\nthe ratio of the black hole size to the cosmological horizon size is in a\nnarrow range above some critical value. There are also \"universal\" black holes\nin which the black hole has an apparent horizon but no event horizon. It turns\nout that both these types of solution are only asymptotically {\\it\nquasi}-Friedmann, because they contain a solid angle deficit at large\ndistances, but they are not necessarily excluded observationally.\n  We also consider the possibility of self-similar black hole solutions in a\nuniverse dominated by a scalar field. If the field is massless, the situation\nresembles the stiff fluid case, so any black hole solution is again contrived,\nalthough there may still be universal black hole solutions. The situation is\nless clear if the scalar field is rolling down a potential and therefore\nmassive, as in the quintessence scenario. Although no explicit asymptotically\nFriedmann black hole solutions of this kind are known, they are not excluded\nand comparison with the $0 < \\gamma < 2/3$ perfect fluid case suggests that\nthey should exist if the black hole is not too large. This implies that a black\nhole might grow as fast as the cosmological horizon in a quintessence-dominated\nuniverse in some circumstances, supporting the proposal that accretion onto\nprimordial black holes may have played a role in the production of the\nsupermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 08:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Here\nwe calculate the disc response for such a general sech^(2/n) density\ndistribution, and show that the warps develop from a smaller radius of 2-4 disc\nscalelengths. This naturally explains why most galaxies show stellar warps that\nstart within the optical radius. Thus a qualitatively different picture of\nubiquitous optical warps emerges for the observed less-steep density profiles.\nThe surprisingly strong dependence on the density profile is due to the fact\nthat the disc self-gravity depends crucially on its mass distribution close to\nthe mid-plane. General results for the radius of onset of warps, obtained as a\nfunction of the disc scalelength and the vertical scaleheight, are presented as\ncontour plots which can be applied to any galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 09:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}

This is due to the combination of very low\nabsorbing column density along this line of sight which allows the shape of the\ndisk emisison to be constrained at low energies by the CCD's, while the tail\ncan be simultaneously determined up to 30 keV by the high energy detectors.\nThese data clearly demonstrate that the observed disk spectrum is broader than\na simple 'sum of blackbodies', and relativistic smearing of the emission is\nstrongly required. However, the intrinsic emission should be more complex than\na (color-corrected) sum of blackbodies as it should also contain photo-electric\nabsorption edges from the partially ionised disk photosphere. These are\nbroadened by the relativistic smearing, but the models predict ~ 3-5 per cent\ndeviations for 1/3- 1 solar abundance around the edge energies, significantly\nstronger than observed. This indicate that the models need to include more\nphysical processes such as self-irradiation, bound-bound (line) absorption,\nand/or emission from recombination continuua and/or lines. Alternatively, if\nnone of these match the data, it may instead require that the accretion disk\ndensity and/or emissivity profile with height is different to that assumed.\nThus these data demonstrate the feasibility of observational tests of our\nfundamental understanding of the vertical structure of accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 11:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The electronic Dicke effect, resulting from\nquasi-resonant states of two side-coupled non-interacting quantum dots, is\nfound to produce important effects on the Kondo resonance of the interacting\ndot. We study in detail the Kondo regime of the system by applying a numerical\nrenormalization group analysis to a finite-U multi-impurity Anderson\nHamiltonian model. We find an extreme narrowing of the Kondo resonance, as the\nsingle-particle levels of the side dots are tuned towards the Fermi level and\n\"squeeze\" the Kondo resonance, accompanied by a strong drop in the Kondo\ntemperature, due to the presence of a supertunneling state. Further, we show\nthat the Kondo temperature vanishes in the limit of the Dicke effect of the\nstructure. By analyzing the magnetic moment and entropy of the three-dot\ncluster versus temperature, we identify a different local singlet that competes\nwith the Kondo state, resulting in the eventual suppression of the Kondo\ntemperature and strongly affecting the spin correlations of the structure.

In one simulation, the star is assumed to remain fixed\nat the center of the inertial reference frame. In the other, stellar motion is\nhandled properly by including an indirect potential in the hydrodynamic\nequations to model the star's reference frame as one which is accelerated by\nstar/disk interactions. The disks in both simulations orbit a solar mass star,\ninitially extend from 2.3 to 40 AU with a r^-1/2 surface density profile, and\nhave a total mass of 0.14 M_sun. The gamma = 5/3 ideal gas is assumed to cool\neverywhere with a constant cooling time of two outer rotation periods.\n  The overall behavior of the disk evolution is similar, except for weakening\nin various measures of GI activity by about at most tens of percent for the\nindirect potential case. Overall conclusions about disk evolution in earlier\npapers by our group, where the star was always assumed to be fixed in an\ninertial frame, remain valid. There is no evidence for independent one-armed\ninstabilities, like SLING, in either simulation. On the other hand, the stellar\nmotion about the system center of mass (COM) in the simulation with the\nindirect potential is substantial, up to 0.25 AU during the burst phase, as GIs\ninitiate, and averaging about 0.9 AU during the asymptotic phase, when the GIs\nreach an overall balance of heating and cooling. These motions appear to be a\nstellar response to nonlinear interactions between discrete global spiral modes\nin both the burst and asymptotic phases of the evolution, and the star's\norbital motion about the COM reflects the orbit periods of disk material near\nthe corotation radii of the dominant spiral waves. This motion is, in\nprinciple, large enough to be observable and could be confused with stellar\nwobble due to the presence of one or more super-Jupiter mass protoplanets\norbiting at 10's AU. We discuss why the excursions in our simulation are so\nmuch larger than those seen in simulations by Rice et al. 2003a.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 19:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
