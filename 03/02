We first test a model where the\neffective Newton's constant, mu, and the ratio of the two gravitational\npotentials, eta, transit from the GR value to another constant at late times;\nin this case, we find that standard GR is fully consistent with the combined\ndata. The strongest constraint comes from the ISW effect which would arise from\nthis gravitational transition; the observed ISW signal imposes a tight\nconstraint on a combination of mu and eta that characterizes the lensing\npotential. Next, we consider four pixels in time and space for each function mu\nand eta, and perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finding that seven of\nthe resulting eight eigenmodes are consistent with GR within the errors. Only\none eigenmode shows a 2-sigma deviation from the GR prediction, which is likely\nto be due to a systematic effect. However, the detection of such a deviation\ndemonstrates the power of our time- and scale-dependent PCA methodology when\ncombining observations of structure formation and expansion history to test GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 17:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 14:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-19"}

For a representative waveguide, we\npredict substantial meV frequency shifts and band structure broadening for a\ntelecommunications operating frequency, even for state of the art fabrication.\nThe disorder-induced broadening is found to increase as the propagation\nfrequency approaches the slow light regime (mode edge) due to restructuring of\nthe electric field distribution.

We propose a\nstrategy to enhance the sampling of MCMC in this context, using a biasing\nprocedure which originates from computational Statistical Physics. The\nprinciple is first to choose a \"reaction coordinate\", that is, a \"direction\" in\nwhich the target distribution is multimodal. In a second step, the marginal\nlog-density of the reaction coordinate with respect to the posterior\ndistribution is estimated; minus this quantity is called \"free energy\" in the\ncomputational Statistical Physics literature. To this end, we use adaptive\nbiasing Markov chain algorithms which adapt their targeted invariant\ndistribution on the fly, in order to overcome sampling barriers along the\nchosen reaction coordinate. Finally, we perform an importance sampling step in\norder to remove the bias and recover the true posterior. The efficiency factor\nof the importance sampling step can easily be estimated \\emph{a priori} once\nthe bias is known, and appears to be rather large for the test cases we\nconsidered. A crucial point is the choice of the reaction coordinate. One\nstandard choice (used for example in the classical Wang-Landau algorithm) is\nminus the log-posterior density. We discuss other choices. We show in\nparticular that the hyper-parameter that determines the order of magnitude of\nthe variance of each component is both a convenient and an efficient reaction\ncoordinate. We also show how to adapt the method to compute the evidence\n(marginal likelihood) of a mixture model.

The\nlow and intermediate ions in this absorber are consistent with an origin in\nphotoionized gas with [Si/H] and [C/H] of -0.6 dex. In contrast, the broader O\nVI absorption is likely produced in collisionally ionized plasma under\nnonequilibrium conditions. The z=0.22638 system has broad-Lya (BLA) and C III\nabsorption offset by v = -53 km/s from O VI. The H I and C III line widths for\nthe BLA imply T = 1.1 x 10^5 K. For non-equilibrium cooling we obtain [C/H] of\n-1.5 dex and a total hydrogen column of N(H) = 3.2 x 10^{18} cm^-2 in the BLA.\nThe O VI, offset from the BLA with no detected H I or C III, is likely\ncollisionally ionized at T ~ 3 x 10^5 K. From the observed multiphase\nproperties and the proximity to a luminous galaxy, we propose that the\nz=0.22496 absorber is an extragalactic analog of a highly ionized Galactic HVC,\nin which the O VI is produced in transition temperature plasma (T ~ 10^5 K) at\nthe interface layers between the warm HVC gas phase and the hot coronal halo of\nthe galaxy. The z=0.22638 O VI - BLA absorber could be tracing a cooling\ncondensing fragment in the nearby galaxy's hot gaseous halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

HII\nregions in static equilibrium comprise a family of similarity solutions,\nparametrized by 3 parameters: beta, gamma, and the product (Q_0 n_rms); beta\ncharacterizes the stellar spectrum, gamma characterizes the dust/gas ratio, Q_0\nis the ionizing output from the star (photons/s), and n_rms is the rms density\nwithin the ionized region. Adopting standard values for beta and gamma, varying\n(Q_0 n_rms) generates a one-parameter family of density profiles, ranging from\nnearly uniform density (small Q_0 n_rms), to hollow-sphere HII regions (large\nQ_0 n_rms). When (Q_0 n_rms) exceeds 10^{52} cm^{-3} s^{-1}, dusty HII regions\nhave conspicuous central cavities, even if no stellar wind is present. For\ngiven beta, gamma and (Q_0 n_rms), a fourth quantity, which can be Q_0,\ndetermines the overall size and density of the HII region. Examples of density\nand emissivity profiles are given.

The primary limitation of these calculations is now\ncomputational. In particular, it is difficult to model systems with large mass\nratio and large spins, since one must accurately resolve the multiple\nlengthscales which play a role in such systems. Perturbation theory can play an\nimportant role in extending the reach of computational modeling for binary\nsystems. In this paper, we present first results of a code which allows us to\nmodel the gravitational waves generated by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown\nof a binary system in which one member of the binary is much more massive than\nthe other. This allows us to accurately calibrate binary dynamics in the large\nmass ratio regime. We focus in this analysis on the recoil imparted to the\nmerged remnant by these waves. We closely examine the \"antikick\", an anti-phase\ncancellation of the recoil arising from the plunge and ringdown waves,\ndescribed in detail by Schnittman et al. We find that, for orbits aligned with\nthe black hole spin, the antikick grows as a function of spin. The total recoil\nis smallest for prograde coalescence into a rapidly rotating black hole, and\nlargest for retrograde coalescence. Amusingly, this completely reverses the\npredicted trend for kick versus spin from analyses that only include inspiral\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 01:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

Here we\nconstruct simplified, cylindrically-symmetric sunspot models, which are\ndesigned to capture the magnetic and thermodynamics effects coming from about\n500 km below the quiet-Sun $\\tau_{5000}=1$ level to the lower chromosphere. We\nuse a combination of existing semi-empirical models of sunspot thermodynamic\nstructure (density, temperature, pressure): the umbral model of Maltby et al.\n(1986) and the penumbral model of Ding and Fang (1989). The OPAL equation of\nstate tables are used to derive the sound speed profile. We smoothly merge the\nnear-surface properties to the quiet-Sun values about 1mm below the surface.\nThe umbral and penumbral radii are free parameters. The magnetic field is added\nto the thermodynamic structure, without requiring magnetostatic equilibrium.\nThe vertical component of the magnetic field is assumed to have a Gaussian\nhorizontal profile, with a maximum surface field strength fixed by surface\nobservations. The full magnetic field vector is solenoidal and determined by\nthe on-axis vertical field, which, at the surface, is chosen such that the\nfield inclination is 45$^\\circ$ at the umbral-penumbral boundary. We construct\na particular sunspot model based on SOHO/MDI observations of the sunspot in\nactive region NOAA 9787. The helioseismic signature of the model sunspot is\nstudied using numerical simulations of the propagation of f, p$_1$, and p$_2$\nwave packets.

Its implementation amounts to treating\nWeyl invariance as a fundamental symmetry of all physical theories. In this\nthesis, we study the consequences of this \"unit invariance\" principle and find\nthat it is a unifying one. Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge\nfield called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to\npoint. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and\nmatter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.\nAs a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to\nchanges of scale. This response is calibrated by certain \"tractor Weyl\nweights\". Reality of these weights yield Breitenlohner-Freedman stability\nbounds in anti de Sitter spaces. Another valuable outcome of our approach is a\ngeneral mechanism for constructing conformally invariant theories. In\nparticular, we provide direct derivations of the novel Weyl invariant\nDeser--Nepomechie vector and spin three-half theories as well as new higher\nspin generalizations thereof. To construct these theories, a \"tractor calculus\"\ncoming from conformal geometry is employed, which keeps manifest Weyl\ninvariance at all stages. In fact, our approach replaces the usual Riemannian\ngeometry description of physics with a conformal geometry one. Within the same\nframework, we also give a description of fermionic and interacting\nsupersymmetric theories which again unifies massless and massive excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 09:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-22"}

The relative dynamics of the system is computed\n{\\it without making any adiabatic approximation} by using an effective one body\n(EOB) description, namely by representing the binary by an effective particle\nof mass $\\mu=m_1 m_2/(m_1+m_2)$ moving in a (quasi-)Schwarzschild background of\nmass $M=m_1+m_2$ and submitted to an $\\O(\\nu)$ 5PN-resummed analytical\nradiation reaction force, with $\\nu=\\mu/M$.

However,\nangular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so only\nthe lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes.\nThe standard sub-grid model for black hole accretion in galaxy formation\nsimulations - based on the Bondi-Hoyle method - does not account for the\nangular momentum of accreting material, and so it is unclear how representative\nthe black hole accretion rate estimated in this way is likely to be. In this\npaper we introduce a new sub-grid model for black hole accretion that naturally\naccounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. Both the black hole\nand its accretion disc are modelled as a composite accretion disc particle. Gas\nparticles are captured by the accretion disc particle if and only if their\norbits bring them within its accretion radius R_acc, at which point their mass\nis added to the accretion disc and feeds the black hole on a viscous timescale\nt_visc. The resulting black hole accretion rate (dM/dt)_BH powers the accretion\nluminosity L_acc ~ (dM/dt)_BH, which drives black hole feedback. Using a series\nof controlled numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our new accretion disc\nparticle method is more physically self-consistent than the Bondi-Hoyle method.\nWe also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle method\nfor systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that the\nM_BH-sigma relation in these systems should be offset from the relation for\nclassical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 14:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 11:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Due to the absence of closed transitions a\nstraightforward application to molecules fails: optical pumping can lead the\nparticle into uncoupled states. An alternative operation in the far\noff-resonant regime generates only very slow cooling due to the reduced\nfield-molecule coupling. We predict to overcome this by using a strongly driven\nring-cavity operated in the sideband cooling regime. As in the optomechanical\nsetups one takes advantage of a collectively enhanced field-molecule coupling\nstrength using a large photon number. A linearized analytical treatment\nconfirmed by full numerical quantum simulations predicts fast cooling despite\nthe off-resonant small single molecule - single photon coupling. Even ground\nstate cooling can be obtained by tuning the cavity field close to the\nAnti-stokes sideband for sufficiently high trapping frequency. Numerical\nsimulations show quantum jumps of the molecules between the lowest two trapping\nlevels, which can be be directly and continuously monitored via scattered light\nintensity detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 14:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

It is shown that the $B(E2)$ values for the\nexcitation of these states are accurately described in the rotor model. The\ninteraction of the strongly deformed $^9$Be nucleus with a spherical target is\ncalculated using the double-folding technique and the effective M3Y\ninteraction, which is supplemented with a repulsive term that is adjusted to\noptimize the fit to the data for the $^{144}$Sm target.

Here we investigate a\nprevious report that there may be a large population of sub-arcsecond\ncompanions to Be stars. We present the first systematic, comparative imaging\nstudy of the binary properties of matched samples of B and Be stars observed\nusing the same equipment. We obtained high angular resolution (0.07-0.1 arcsec)\nK band Adaptive Optics data of 40 B stars and 39 Be stars. The separations that\ncan be probed range from 0.1 to 8 arcsec (corresponding to 20-1000 AU), and\nmagnitude differences up to 10 magnitudes can in principle be covered. We\ndetect 11 binaries out of 37 Be targets (corresponding to a binary fraction of\n30 +/- 8%) and 10 binaries out of 36 B targets (29 +/- 8%). Further tests\ndemonstrate that the B and Be binary systems are not only similar in frequency\nbut also remarkably similar in terms of binary separations, flux differences\nand mass ratios. We find that any hypotheses invoking binary companions as\nresponsible for the formation of a disk need the companions to be closer than\n20 AU. Close companions are known to affect the circumstellar disks of Be\nstars, but as not all Be stars have been found to be close binaries, the data\nsuggest that binarity can not be responsible for the Be phenomenon in all Be\nstars. Finally, the similarities of the binary parameters themselves also shed\nlight on the Be formation mechanism. They strongly suggest that the initial\nconditions that gave rise to B and Be star formation must, to all intents and\npurposes, be similar. This in turn indicates that the Be phenomenon is not the\nresult of a different star formation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 15:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
