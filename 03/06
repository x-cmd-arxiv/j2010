Comparing VLA and XMM\nradial profiles of several such clusters, we find a universal linear\ncorrelation between radio and X-ray surface brightness, valid in both types of\nhalos. It implies a halo central emissivity\nnu*j_nu=10^{-31.4+-0.2}*(n/10^-2cm^-3)^2*(T/T_0)^{0.2+-0.5} erg/s/cm^3, where T\nand T_0 are the local and central temperatures, and n is the electron number\ndensity. We argue that the tight correlation and the scaling of j_nu, combined\nwith morphological and spectral evidence, indicate that both GHs and MHs arise\nfrom secondary electrons and positrons, produced in cosmic-ray ion (CRI)\ncollisions with a strongly magnetized, B >3 muG intracluster gas. When the\nmagnetic energy density drops below that of the microwave background, the radio\nemission weakens considerably, producing halos with a clumpy morphology (e.g.\nRXCJ2003.5-2323 and A2255) or a distinct radial break. We thus measure a\nmagnetic field B=3 muG at a radius r~110 kpc in A2029 and r~50 kpc in Perseus.\nThe spectrum of secondaries, produced from hadronic collisions of ~20 GeV CRIs,\nreflects the energy dependence of the collision cross section. We use the\nobserved spectra of halos, in particular where they steepen with increasing\nradius or frequency, to (i) measure B~10(nu/700 MHz) muG, with nu the spectral\nbreak frequency; (ii) identify a correlation between the average spectrum and\nthe central magnetic field; and (iii) infer a CRI spectral index s <-2.7 and\nenergy fraction xi_p~10^{-3.6+-0.2} at particle energies above 10 GeV. Our\nresults favor a model where CRIs diffuse away from their sources (which are\nprobably supernovae, according to a preliminary correlation with star\nformation), whereas the magnetic fields are generated by mergers in GHs and by\ncore sloshing in MHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 20:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 17:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 17:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 06:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Such sources often exhibit highly transient spectra\nevolving rapidly, compared with source lifetimes. Radiation emitted from these\nsources is typically associated with non-linear plasma physics, complex field\ntopologies and non-thermal particle distributions. In such circumstances a\nstandard synchrotron paradigm may fail to produce accurate conclusions\nregarding the underlying physics. Simulating spectral emission and spectral\nevolution numerically in various relativistic shock scenarios is then the only\nviable method to determine the detailed physical origin of the emitted spectra.\nIn this Letter we present synthetic radiation spectra representing the early\nstage development of the filamentation (streaming) instability of an initially\nunmagnetized plasma, which is relevant for both collisionless shock formation\nand reconnection dynamics in relativistic astrophysical outflows, as well as\nfor laboratory astrophysics experiments.

Spectra exhibit dependence on the presence - or\nabsence - of an inert plasma constituent, when comparing baryonic plasmas (i.e.\ncontaining protons) with pair plasmas.

This indicates that, apart from \"quantum jumps,\" the atom\nexhibits a kind of \"quantum incompressibility\" during free fall in\ninhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth. A\nsuperconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating around\nit behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall.

The procedure is tested on Monte Carlo generated events with a\nrealistic detector resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 17:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2010 13:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

Due to the\ntight confinement and strong field enhancement, SPPs are widely used for\nvarious purposes at the subwavelength scale. Taking advantage of transformation\noptics, here we demonstrate that the confinement as well as propagation of SPPs\ncan be managed in a prescribed manner by careful control of the dielectric\nmaterial properties adjacent to a metal. Since the metal properties are\ncompletely unaltered, it provides a straightforward way for practical\nrealizations.

The\ncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of the CH equation in action-angle variables\nis expressed for solitons by using the scattering data for its associated\nisospectral eigenvalue problem, rephrased as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. The\nmomentum map from the action-angle scattering variables $T^*({\\mathbb{T}^N})$\nto the flow momentum ($\\mathfrak{X}^*$) provides the Eulerian representation of\nthe $N$-soliton solution of CH in terms of the scattering data and squared\neigenfunctions of its isospectral eigenvalue problem. The dispersionless limit\nof the CH equation and its resulting peakon solutions are examined by using an\nasymptotic expansion in the dispersion parameter. The peakon solutions of the\ndispersionless CH equation in one dimension are shown to generalize in higher\ndimensions to peakon wave-front solutions of the EPDiff equation whose\nassociated momentum is supported on smoothly embedded subspaces. The Eulerian\nrepresentations of the singular solutions of both CH and EPDiff are given by\nthe (cotangent-lift) momentum maps arising from the left action of the\ndiffeomorphisms on smoothly embedded subspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 00:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

However, the\nreliability of that tracer has long been questioned in environments different\nfrom the Milky Way. We study the relationship between H2 and CO abundances\nusing a fully dynamical model of magnetized turbulence coupled to a chemical\nnetwork simplified to follow only the dominant pathways for H2 and CO formation\nand destruction, and including photodissociation using a six-ray approximation.\nWe find that the abundance of H2 is primarily determined by the amount of time\navailable for its formation, which is proportional to the product of the\ndensity and the metallicity, but insensitive to photodissociation.\nPhotodissociation only becomes important at extinctions under a few tenths of a\nvisual magnitude, in agreement with both observational and prior theoretical\nwork. On the other hand, CO forms quickly, within a dynamical time, but its\nabundance depends primarily on photodissociation, with only a weak secondary\ndependence on H2 abundance. As a result, there is a sharp cutoff in CO\nabundance at mean visual extinctions A_V < 3. At lower values of A_V we find\nthat the ratio of H2 column density to CO emissivity X_CO is proportional to\nA_V^(-3.5). This explains the discrepancy observed in low metallicity systems\nbetween cloud masses derived from CO observations and other techniques such as\ninfrared emission. Our work predicts that CO-bright clouds in low metallicity\nsystems should be systematically larger or denser than Milky Way clouds, or\nboth. Our results further explain the narrow range of observed molecular cloud\ncolumn densities as a threshold effect, without requiring the assumption of\nvirial equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 00:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 12:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this paper we discuss these phases, the\ntransitions between them, and the way they are seen by a \"Census Taker\"; a\nhypothetical observer inside the non-inflating, \"black,\" region. We discuss\nthree phases that we call, \"black island,\" \"tubular,\" and \"white island.\" The\nblack island phase is familiar, comprised of rare Coleman De Luccia bubble\nnucleation events. The Census Taker sees an essentially spherical boundary,\ndescribed by the conformal field theory of the FRW/CFT correspondence. In the\ntubular phase the Census Taker sees a complicated infinite genus structure\ncomposed of arbitrarily long tubes. The white island phase is even more\nmysterious from the black side. Surprisingly, when viewed from the\nnon-inflating region this phase resembles a closed, positively curved universe\nwhich eventually collapses to a singularity. Nevertheless, pockets of eternal\ninflation continue forever. In addition there is an \"aborted\" phase in which no\neternal inflation takes place.

Based upon our recent\npublication on the problem of gravitational collapse in the physical universe\nfor an external observer, the following results are reported here: (1) Matter\ncan indeed fall across the event horizon within a finite time and thus BHs,\nrather than \"frozen stars\", are formed in gravitational collapse in the\nphysical universe.

The present study on PPP\nchains has revealed that, (i) long-range electron correlations enable both the\ncharge and spin degree of freedom of the electron, to propagate faster in the\nPPP model compared to Hubbard model, (ii) for standard parameters of the PPP\nmodel as applied to conjugated polymers, the charge velocity is almost twice\nthat of the spin velocity and, (iii) the simplistic interpretation of\nlong-range correlations by merely renormalizing the {\\it U} value of the\nHubbard model fails to explain the dynamics of doped holes/electrons in the PPP\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 10:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 04:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 05:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

This inflow of relatively\nlow-metallicity gas dilutes the metallicity of the circumnuclear gas. We have\ninvestigated several aspects of the process as the timing and duration of the\ndilution and its correlation with the induced star formation. We analysed major\n(1:1) gas-rich interactions and mergers, spanning a range of initial orbital\ncharacteristics. Star formation and metal enrichment from SNe are included in\nour model. Our results show that the strongest trend is between the star\nformation rate and the dilution of the metals in the nuclear region; i.e., the\nmore intense the central burst of star formation, the more the gas is diluted.\nThis trend comes from strong inflows of relatively metal-poor gas from the\nouter regions of both disks, which fuels the intense star formation and lowers\nthe overall metallicity for a time. The strong inflows happen on timescales of\nabout 10^8 years or less, and the most intense star formation and lowest gas\nphase metallicities are seen generally after the first pericentre passage. As\nthe star formation proceeds and the merger advances, the dilution reduces and\nenrichment becomes dominant - ultimately increasing the metallicity of the\ncircumnuclear gas to a level higher than the initial metallicities of the\nmerging galaxies. The \"fly-bys\" - pairs that interact but do not merge - also\ncause some dilution. We even see some dilution early in the merger or in the\n\"fly-bys\" and thus do not observe a strong trend between the nuclear\nmetallicities and separation in our simulations until the merger is well\nadvanced. We also analyse the O and Fe enrichment of the ISM, and show that the\nevolution of the alpha/Fe ratios, as well as the dilution of the central gas\nmetallicity, can be used as a clock for \"dating\" the interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 11:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 12:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Spectro-polarimetric observations of the quiet Sun at\nthe disk center were performed with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board\nHinode with Fe I 630.2 nm lines. Using repetitive scans with a cadence of 130\ns, we first detect the horizontal field that appears inside a granule, near its\nedge. On the second scan, vertical fields with positive and negative polarities\nappear at both ends of the horizontal field. Then, the horizontal field\ndisappears leaving the bipolar vertical magnetic fields. The results from the\ninversion of the Stokes spectra clearly point to the existence of a flux tube\nwith magnetic field strength of $\\sim400$ G rising through the line forming\nlayer of the Fe I 630.2 nm lines.

The observed Doppler velocity is\nmaximally 3 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the upward motion of the structure as\nretrieved from the SIRGAUS code.

The particle density\n$\\rho\\in (0,\\infty)$ is kept fixed. Our main result is the identification of\nthe limiting free energy, $f(\\beta,\\rho)$, at positive temperature $1/\\beta$,\nin terms of an explicit variational formula, for any fixed $\\rho$ if $\\beta$ is\nsufficiently small, and for any fixed $\\beta$ if $\\rho$ is sufficiently small.\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium is described by the symmetrized trace of\n$e^{-\\beta {\\mathcal{H}}_N}$, where ${\\mathcal{H}}_N$ denotes the corresponding\nHamilton operator. The well-known Feynman--Kac formula reformulates this trace\nin terms of $N$ interacting Brownian bridges. Due to the symmetrization, the\nbridges are organized in an ensemble of cycles of various lengths. The novelty\nof our approach is a description in terms of a marked Poisson point process\nwhose marks are the cycles. This allows for an asymptotic analysis of the\nsystem via a large-deviations analysis of the stationary empirical field. The\nresulting variational formula ranges over random shift-invariant marked point\nfields and optimizes the sum of the interaction and the relative entropy with\nrespect to the reference process. In our proof of the lower bound for the free\nenergy, we drop all interaction involving \"infinitely long\" cycles, and their\npossible presence is signalled by a loss of mass of the \"finitely long\" cycles\nin the variational formula. In the proof of the upper bound, we only keep the\nmass on the \"finitely long\" cycles. We expect that the precise relationship\nbetween these two bounds lies at the heart of Bose--Einstein condensation and\nintend to analyze it further in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 15:24:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 09:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 12:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}
