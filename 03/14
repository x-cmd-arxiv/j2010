We argue that\nthe net effect of these instabilities will be to pin the pressure anisotropies\nat a marginal level, controlled by the plasma beta parameter. This gives rise\nto local heating rates that turn out to be comparable to the radiative cooling\nrates. Furthermore, we show that a balance between this heating and\nBremsstrahlung cooling is thermally stable, unlike the often conjectured\nbalance between cooling and thermal conduction. Given a sufficient (and\nprobably self-regulating) supply of turbulent power, this provides a physical\nmechanism for mitigating cooling flows and preventing cluster core collapse.\nFor observed density and temperature profiles, the assumed balance of viscous\nheating and radiative cooling allows us to predict magnetic-field strengths,\nturbulent velocities and turbulence scales as functions of distance from the\ncentre.

Here we present results of star formation simulations that accurately\ntrack the evolution of a protostellar fragment over eleven orders of magnitude\nin density (from 300 cm^-3 to \\approx 10^14 cm^-3), i.e., from the early\nambipolar-diffusion--initiated fragmentation phase, through the magnetically\nsupercritical, dynamical-contraction phase and the subsequent magnetic\ndecoupling stage, to the formation of a protostellar core in near hydrostatic\nequilibrium. As found by Fiedler & Mouschovias (1993), gravitationally-driven\nambipolar diffusion leads to the formation and subsequent dynamic contraction\nof a magnetically supercritical core. Moreover, we find that ambipolar\ndiffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, is responsible for decoupling all the species\nexcept the electrons from the magnetic field, by a density \\approx 3 x 10^12\ncm^-3. Magnetic decoupling precedes the formation of a central stellar object\nand ultimately gives rise to a concentration of magnetic flux (a `magnetic\nwall') outside the hydrostatic core --- as also found by Tassis & Mouschovias\n(2005a,b) through a different approach.

We\nanalyze the effects of bonding type, molecular orientation, and geometry\nrelaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport across\nthe single-molecule junction. We consider nine interface geometries leading to\nfive bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations: (i) Au-C bonding, (ii)\nAu-Au bonding, (iii) Au-S bonding, (iv) Au-H bonding, and (v) physisorption via\nvan der Waals forces. The two molecular orientations of Mn$_{12}$ correspond to\nthe magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [hereafter denoted\nas orientation (1)] or parallel [orientation (2)] to the direction of electron\ntransport. We find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level in all the cases that we have\nsimulated. Relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant\noccupied molecular levels toward the Fermi energy as well as slightly reduces\nthe broadening of the LUMO level. As a result, the current slightly decreases\nat low bias voltage. Our calculations also show that placing the molecule in\nthe orientation (1) broadens the LUMO level much more than in the orientation\n(2), due to the internal structure of the Mn$_{12}$. Consequently, junctions\nwith the former orientation yield a higher current than those with the latter.\nAmong all of the bonding types considered, the Au-C bonding gives rise to the\nhighest current (about one order of magnitude higher than the Au-S bonding),\nfor a given distance between the electrodes. The current through the junction\nwith other bonding types decreases in the order of Au-Au, Au-S, and Au-H.\nImportantly, the spin-filtering effect in all the nine geometries stays robust\nand their ratios of the majority-spin to the minority-spin transmission\ncoefficients are in the range of 10$^3$ to 10$^8$. The general trend in\ntransport among the different bonding types and molecular orientations obtained\nfrom this study may be applied to other single-molecular magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2010 00:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We examine the\nclustering properties of these stellar mass selected samples as a function of\nredshift and stellar mass, and discuss the implications of measured clustering\nstrengths in terms of their likely halo masses. We find that galaxies with high\nstellar masses have a progressively higher clustering strength, and amplitude,\nthan galaxies with lower stellar masses. We also find that galaxies within a\nfixed stellar mass range have a higher clustering strength at higher redshifts.\nWe furthermore use our measured clustering strengths, combined with models from\nMo & White (2002), to determine the average total masses of the dark matter\nhaloes hosting these galaxies. We conclude that for all galaxies in our sample\nthe stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is always lower than the universal\nbaryonic mass fraction. Using our results, and a compilation from the\nliterature, we furthermore show that there is a strong correlation between\nstellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio and derived halo masses for central galaxies,\nsuch that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of their mass in the\nform of stars over our entire redshift range.

This suggests\nthat galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter\nhaloes, and earlier in massive haloes.

Because these are much\nricher structures than Kripke models, they do not straightforwardly inherit the\nmodel-theoretical results of modal logic. Therefore, while epistemic\nplausibility structures are well-suited for modeling purposes, an extensive\ninvestigation of their model theory has been lacking so far. The aim of the\npresent paper is to fill exactly this gap, by initiating a systematic\nexploration of the model theory of epistemic plausibility models. Like in\n'ordinary' modal logic, the focus will be on the notion of bisimulation. We\ndefine various notions of bisimulations (parametrized by a language L) and show\nthat L-bisimilarity implies L-equivalence. We prove a Hennesy-Milner type\nresult, and also two undefinability results.
