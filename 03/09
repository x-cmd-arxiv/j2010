Unfortunately, the generally accepted treatment of the\nreflection effect in interacting binaries is not very suitable to study cold\nobjects irradiated by hot objects or extrasolar planets. Our simple model of\nthe reflection effect takes into account the reflection (scattering), heating\nand heat redistribution over the surface of the irradiated object. The shape of\nthe objects is described by the Roche potential and limb and gravity darkening\ncan be taken into account. The orbital revolution and rotation of the planet\nwith proper Doppler shifts for the scattered and thermal radiation are also\naccounted for. Subsequently, light-curves and/or spectra of exoplanets were\nmodeled and the effects of the heat redistribution, limb darkening/brightening,\n(non-)grey albedo, and non-spherical shape were studied. Recent observations of\nHD189733b, WASP12b, and Wasp-19b were reproduced reasonably well. HD189733b has\nlow Bond albedo and intense heat redistribution. Wasp-19b has low Bond albedo\nand low heat redistribution.

The X-ray data from $XMM$--$Newton$ are used to define the\nspectral properties of the ionising nuclear source. The $Chandra$ data are used\nto trace the spatial characteristics of the soft X-ray emission. This\ninformation is then compared to the HST characteristics. The X-ray spectrum of\nthe nucleus of NGC 5252 is intrinsically flat and absorbed by neutral gas with\na column density N~10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Below 1 keV a soft excess is detected.\nThe high-resolution spectrum obtained with the XMM-Newton RGS shows the\npresence, in the 0.2-1.5 keV range, of emission lines which strongly indicate\nthat the soft X-ray component is due to ionised gas. Moreover, the soft X-ray\nemission is spatially resolved around and well overlaps the images obtained in\nnarrow [OIII] optical band. The [OIII]/soft-X flux ratios along the ionisation\ncones is basically constant. This indicates that the electron density does not\nsignificantly deviates from the r$^{-2}$ law (constant ionisation parameter).\nThis result combined with previous optical studies suggest two plausible but\ndifferent scenarios in the reconstruction of the last 30000 years history of\nthe central AGN. The most promising one is that the source is indeed a \"quasar\nrelic\" with steady and inefficient energy release from the accretion of matter\nonto the central super-massive black-hole. This scenario is suggested also by\nthe flat nuclear X-ray spectrum that suggests an advection dominate accretion\nflow (ADAF) like emission mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2010 16:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For this reason, the study of\nXLPE insulation is crucial to improve cable features and lifetime. Although a\nrelaxational analysis using Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents (TSDC)\ncan yield a lot of information about XLPE properties, sometimes its results are\ndifficult to interpret. In previous works it was found that the TSDC spectrum\nof cables is dominated by a broad heteropolar peak, that appears just before an\nhomopolar inversion, but the analysis of the cause of the peak was not\nconclusive. We have used a combination of TSDC and Isothermal Depolarization\nCurrents (IDC) techniques to investigate further this issue. In order to\ndiscard spurious effects from the semiconductor interfaces, samples have been\nprepared in certain configurations and preliminary measurements have been done.\nThen, TSDC experiments have been performed using conventional polarization\nbetween 140C and 40C. Also, IDC measurements have been carried out between 90C\nand 110C in 2C steps. The TSDC spectra show the broad peak at 95C. On the other\nhand, IDC show a combination of power and exponential charge currents.\nExponential currents are fitted to a Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts (KWW) model.\nThe parameters obtained present approximately an Arrhenius behavior with\nE_a=1.32eV, tau_0=3.29e-16s, with a KWW parameter beta=0.8. The depolarization\ncurrent calculated from the obtained parameters turns out to match the dominant\npeak of TSDC spectra rather well. From the results and given the partially\nmolten state of the material, we conclude that the most likely cause of the\nexponential IDC and the main TSDC peak is the relaxation of molecular dipoles\nfrom additives incorporated during the manufacturing process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2010 17:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 17:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 16:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 08:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 17:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

The NEC\nis violated by upward fluctuations of the local Hubble rate, which occur with\nhigh probability in the fluctuation-dominated regime of inflation. These\nfluctuations lead at late times to the formation of black holes and thus limit\nthe observability of inflationary evolution.

The\ncalculation also provides a reasonably precise definition of the boundary of\nthe fluctuation-dominated regime, with an uncertainty of a few percent. In\nsimple models of single-field inflation compatible with current CMB\nobservations, I find <Delta N> of order 10^5.

We propose a simple model, a variant of the Contact Process (CP),\nwhich includes two key extra features: varying external\n(environmental/rainfall) conditions and tree age. The system fluctuates locally\nbetween a woodland and a grassland phase, corresponding to the active and\nabsorbing phases of the underlying pure contact process. This leads to a highly\nvariable stable phase characterized by patches of the woodland and grassland\nphases coexisting dynamically. We show that the mean time to tree extinction\nunder this model increases as a power-law of system size and can be of the\norder of 10,000,000 years in even moderately sized savannas. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that while local interactions among trees may influence tree\nspatial distribution and the order of the transition between woodland and\ngrassland phases, they do not affect dynamical coexistence.

We use deep long slit\nspectra obtained with the FORS2 spectrograph at the VLT in the optical and\nnear-infrared wavelength ranges for the brightest HII regions in the disk polar\ndisk of NGC 4650A.

The Oxygen abundance measured\nfor the polar disk is then compared with those measured for different galaxy\ntypes of similar total luminosities, and then compared against the predictions\nof different polar ring formation scenarios. The average metallicity values for\nthe polar disk in NGC 4650A is Z=0.2 Zsun, and it is lower that the values\nmeasured for ordinary spirals of similar luminosity.

We show that a large fraction of the primordial\npopulation should have been lost by the proto-GCs. The extremely low Al\nabundances found for the primordial population of massive GCs indicate a very\nfast enrichment process before the formation of the primordial population. We\nsuggest a scenario for the formation of GCs including at least 3 main phases:\ni) the formation of a precursor population (likely due to the interaction of\ncosmological structures similar to those leading to dwarf spheroidals, but\nresiding at smaller Rgc, with the early Galaxy or with other structures), ii)\nwhich triggers a large episode of star formation (the primordial population),\nand iii) the formation of the current GC, mainly within a cooling flow formed\nby the slow winds of a fraction of the primordial population. The precursor\npopulation is very effective in raising the metal content in massive and/or\nmetal poor (mainly halo) clusters, while its role is minor in small and/or\nmetal rich (mainly disk) ones. Finally, we use PCA and multivariate relations\nto study the phase of metal-enrichment from 1st to 2nd generation.

In three dimensions,\nthis Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) can develop spiral modes that\nspin-up the protoneutron star. Here we study these non-axisymmetric modes by\ncombining linear stability analysis and three-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic simulations with Zeus-MP, focusing on characterizing their spatial\nstructure and angular momentum content. We do not impose any rotation on the\nbackground accretion flow, and use simplified microphysics with no neutrino\nheating or nuclear dissociation. Spiral modes are examined in isolation by\nchoosing flow parameters such that only the fundamental mode is unstable for a\ngiven polar index, leading to good agreement with linear theory. We find that\nany superposition of sloshing modes with non-zero relative phases survives in\nthe nonlinear regime and leads to angular momentum redistribution. It follows\nthat the range of perturbations required to obtain spin-up is broader than that\nneeded to obtain the limiting case of a phase shift of pi/2. The bulk of the\nangular momentum redistribution occurs during a phase of exponential growth,\nand arises from internal torques that are second order in the perturbation\namplitude. This redistribution gives rise to at least two counter rotating\nregions, with the maximum angular momentum of a given sign approaching a\nsignificant fraction of the mass accretion rate times the shock radius squared\n(Mdot * r_shock^2 ~ 1E+47 g/cm^2/s, spin period ~60 ms). Nonlinear mode\ncoupling at saturation causes the angular momentum to fluctuate in all\ndirections with much smaller amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2010 21:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 18:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We divide the breakdown process into three\nstages: 1) we model surface failure using molecular dynamics of fracture caused\nby electrostatic tensile stress, 2) we model the ionization of neutrals\nresponsible for plasma initiation and plasma growth using a particle in cell\ncode, and 3) we model surface damage by assuming a process similar to unipolar\narcing. We find that the cold, dense plasma in contact with the surface\nproduces very small Debye lengths and very high electric fields over a large\narea, consistent with unipolar arc behavior, although unipolar arcs are\nstrictly defined with equipotential boundaries. These high fields produce\nstrong erosion mechanisms, primarily self sputtering, compatible with the\ncrater formation that we see.

Unlike HeII Ly-alpha absorption (the subject of much\nrecent study), the difficulty with using this transition to study HeII\nreionization is not saturation but rather that the absorption is weak.

The free geodesic motion on the S^3 manifold is\ndescribed by means of the scalar conformal equation there, which is of the\nKlein-Gordon type. The equation is then gauged by the \"curved\" Coulomb\npotential that has the form of a cotangent function. Conformal symmetry is not\nexact, this because the gauge potential slightly modifies the conformal\ncentrifugal barrier of the free geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the degeneracy\nbetween P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states\nbelonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the\ncorrect mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a\ncombined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and\na parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar\nat higher masses, on the other. The quality of the wave functions is\nillustrated by calculations of realistic mean-square charge radii and electric\ncharge form-factors on the examples of the proton, and the protonic P11(1440),\nand S11(1535) resonances. The scheme also allows for a prediction of the\ndressing function of an effective instantaneous gluon propagator from the\nFourier transform of the gauge potential. We find a dressing function that is\nfinite in the infrared and tends to zero at infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2010 22:39:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 23:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-30"}

We start our simulations\nafter a central protostar has formed, containing ~ 10% of the mass of the\nprotostellar cloud. Subsequent evolution depends on the angular momentum of the\naccreting envelope. We find that disk accretion matches the infall rate early\nin the disk evolution because much of the inner disk is hot enough to couple to\nthe magnetic field. Later infall reaches the disk beyond ~10 AU, and the disk\nundergoes outbursts of accretion in FU Ori-like events as described in Zhu et\nal. 2009c. If the initial cloud core is moderately rotating most of the central\nstar's mass is built up by these outburst events. Our results suggest that the\nprotostellar \"luminosity problem\" is eased by accretion during these FU\nOri-like outbursts. After infall stops the disk enters the T Tauri phase.

Comparison with our previous two-dimensional\ndisk model calculations (Zhu et al. 2009b, Z2009b) indicates that the neglect\nof radial effects and two-dimensional disk structure in the one-dimensional\ncase makes only modest differences in the results; this allows us to use the\nsimpler models to explore parameter space efficiently. We find that the mass\ninfall rates typically estimated for low-mass protostars generally result in\nAU-scale disk accretion outbursts, as predicted by our previous analysis (Zhu\net al. 2009a,Z2009a). We also confirm quasi-steady accretion behavior for high\nmass infall rates if the values of $\\alpha$-parameter for the magnetorotational\ninstability is small, while at this high accretion rate convection from the\nthermal instability may lead to some variations. We further constrain the\ncombinations of the $\\alpha$-parameter and the MRI critical temperature, which\ncan reproduce observed outburst behavior.

Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph\non the Keck II 10-m telescope, 19 such galaxies were targeted, as well as six\nadditional [OII]-emitting cluster members that exhibited other signs of ongoing\nstar-formation. Nearly half (~47%) of the 19 [OII]-emitting, absorption-line\ndominated galaxies exhibit [OII] to Ha equivalent width ratios higher than\nunity, the typical value for star-forming galaxies. A majority (~68%) of these\n19 galaxies are classified as LINER/Seyfert based on the emission-line ratio of\n[NII] and Ha, increasing to ~85% for red [OII]-emitting, absorption-line\ndominated galaxies. The LINER/Seyfert galaxies exhibit L([OII])/L(Ha) ratios\nsignificantly higher than that observed in populations of star-forming\ngalaxies, suggesting that [OII] is a poor indicator of star-formation in a\nlarge fraction of high-redshift cluster members. We estimate that at least ~20%\nof galaxies in high-redshift clusters contain a LINER/Seyfert component that\ncan be revealed with line ratios. We also investigate the effect this\npopulation has on the star formation rate of cluster galaxies and the\npost-starburst fraction, concluding that LINER/Seyferts must be accounted for\nif these quantities are to be meaningful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 05:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 May 2010 00:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

If the Planck\nscale is of the order of a TeV, noncommutative geometry inspired black holes\ncould become accessible to experiments. In this paper, we present a detailed\nphenomenological study of the production and decay of these black holes at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). Noncommutative inspired black holes are relatively\ncold and can be well described by the microcanonical ensemble during their\nentire decay. One of the main consequences of the model is the existence of a\nblack hole remnant. The mass of the black hole remnant increases with\ndecreasing mass scale associated with noncommutative and decreasing number of\ndimensions. The experimental signatures could be quite different from previous\nstudies of black holes and remnants at the LHC since the mass of the remnant\ncould be well above the Planck scale. Although the black hole remnant can be\nvery heavy, and perhaps even charged, it could result in very little activity\nin the central detectors of the LHC experiments, when compared to the usual\nanticipated black hole signatures. If this type of noncommutative inspired\nblack hole can be produced and detected, it would result in an additional mass\nthreshold above the Planck scale at which new physics occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 06:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Image denoising is a common procedure in digital\nimage processing aiming at the removal of noise, which may corrupt an image\nduring its acquisition or transmission, while retaining its quality. This\nprocedure is traditionally performed in the spatial or frequency domain by\nfiltering. The aim of image enhancement is to reconstruct the true image from\nthe corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to\ndegradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the\noriginal image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter\nis the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination\nof neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of\nsmoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is\nthe one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small\nneighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high\nnoise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Median (CWM)\nfilter has got a better average performance over the median filter [8]. However\nthe original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high\nnoise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To\nillustrate the superiority of the proposed approach by overcoming the existing\nproblem, the proposed new scheme (AMF) Adaptive Median Filter has been\nsimulated along with the standard ones and various performance measures have\nbeen compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 07:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

The face expression recognition\nproblem is challenging because different individuals display the same\nexpression differently. This paper presents an overview of gesture recognition\nin real time using the concepts of correlation and Mahalanobis distance.We\nconsider the six universal emotional categories namely joy, anger, fear,\ndisgust, sadness and surprise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 07:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-10"}

This is mainly due to that the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis\nusing CT image lies on the image quality. The denoising technique for CT images\nusing window-based Multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding shows the\neffectiveness in denoising, however, a drawback exists in selecting the closer\nwindows in the process of window-based multi-wavelet transformation and\nthresholding.

On the basis of these effects a mechanism of\nenergy absorption at filling porous medium by nonwetting liquid is suggested.\nIn accordance with this mechanism, the absorption of mechanical energy is a\nresult expenditure of energy for the formation of menisci in the pores on the\nshell of the infinite cluster and expenditure of energy for the formation of\nliquid-porous medium interface in the pores belonging to the infinite cluster\nof filled pores. It was found that in dependences on the porosity and,\nconsequently, in dependences on the number of filled pores neighbors, the\nthermal effect of filling can be either positive or negative and the cycle of\ninfiltration-defiltration can be closed with full outflow of liquid. It can\noccur under certain relation between percolation properties of porous medium\nand the energy characteristics of the liquid-porous medium interface and the\nliquid-gas interface.

The\nanalysis is an implementation of the standard mode-sum regularization scheme:\nWe first calculate the multipole modes of the scalar-field perturbation using\nnumerical integration in the frequency domain, and then apply a certain\nregularization procedure to each of the modes. The dissipative piece of the SSF\nis found to be consistent with the flux of energy and angular momentum carried\nby the scalar waves through the event horizon and out to infinity. The\nconservative (radial) component of the SSF is found to be attractive (inward\npointing) for $r_0>r_{\\rm c}(a)$ and repulsive (outward pointing) for\n$r_0<r_{\\rm c}(a)$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter, $r_0$ is the\nBoyer-Lindquist orbital radius, and $r_{\\rm c}$ is a critical $a$-dependent\nradius at which the conservative SSF vanishes. When the motion is retrograde\nthe conservative SSF is repulsive for all $r_0$ (as in the Schwarzschild case).\nThe dominant conservative effect of the SSF in Schwarzschild spacetime is known\nto be of 3rd post-Newtonian (PN) order (with a logarithmic running). Our\nnumerical results suggest that the leading-order PN correction due to the black\nhole's spin arises from spin-orbit coupling at 3PN, which dominates the overall\nSSF effect at large $r_0$. In PN language, the change-of-sign of the radial SSF\nis attributed to an interplay between the spin-orbit term ($\\propto\n-ar_0^{-4.5}$) and the \"Schwarzschild\" term ($\\propto r_0^{-5}\\log r_0$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 12:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 13:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 07:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

It\ndescribes an inseparable connection between quantum systems, and properties\nthereof. In a quantum mechanical description even systems far apart from each\nother can share a common state. This entanglement of the subsystems, although\narising from mathematical principles, is no mere abstract concept, but can be\ntested in experiment, and be utilized in modern quantum information theory\nprocedures, such as quantum teleportation. In particular, entangled states play\na crucial role in testing our understanding of reality, by violating Bell\ninequalities. While the role of entanglement is well studied in the realm of\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics, its significance in a relativistic quantum\ntheory is a relatively new field of interest. In this work the consequences of\na relativistic description of quantum entanglement are discussed. We analyze\nthe representations of the symmetry groups of special relativity, i.e. of the\nLorentz group, and the Poincar\\'e group, on the Hilbert space of states.

It is explained, how, despite\nof this, the maximally possible violation of Bell inequalities is frame\nindependent, when using appropriate spin observables, which are related to the\nPauli-Ljubanski vector, a Casimir operator of the Poincar\\'e group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 14:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

Recent experimental\nprogress in trapping, cooling, and controlling polar molecules with large\nelectric dipole moments has, therefore, motivated much theoretical effort. In a\nrecent letter, we have briefly discussed the application of a variational\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock approach to study theoretically both the static and\nthe dynamic properties of such a system in a cylinder-symmetric harmonic trap.\nWe focused on the hydrodynamic regime, where collisions assure the equilibrium\nlocally. Here, we present a detailed theory, extended to encompass the general\ncase of a harmonic trap geometry without any symmetry. After deriving the\nequations of motion for the gas, we explore their static solutions to\ninvestigate key properties like the aspect ratios in both real and momentum\nspace as well as the stability diagram. We find that, despite the lack of\nsymmetry of the trap, the momentum distribution remains cylinder symmetric. The\nequations of motion are then used to study the low-lying hydrodynamic\nexcitations, where, apart from the quadrupole and monopole modes, also the\nradial quadrupole mode is investigated. Furthermore, we study the\ntime-of-flight dynamics as it represents an important diagnostic tool for\nquantum gases. We find that the real-space aspect ratios are inverted during\nthe expansion, while the one in momentum space becomes asymptotically unity. In\naddition, anisotropic features of the dipole-dipole interaction are discussed\nin detail.

In order to clarify some well-established conclusions about the\nquantum Zeno effect (QZE) and the quantum anti-Zeno effect (QAZE), we do not\nuse the rotating wave approximation (RWA) in obtaining an effective\nHamiltonian. We examine various spectral distributions by making use of our\npresent approach in comparison with other approaches. It is found that with\nrespect to a bare excited state even without the RWA, the QAZE can still happen\nfor some cases, e.g., the interacting spectra of hydrogen. But for a physical\nexcited state, which is a renormalized dressed state of the atomic state, the\nQAZE disappears and only the QZE remains. These discoveries inevitably show a\ntransition from the QZE to the QAZE as the measurement interval changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 15:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 01:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 23:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-04"}

We gathered about 100 high-resolution spectra of three typical HgMn\n(mercury-manganese) stars, HD 11753, HD 53244, and HD 221507, to search for\nslowly pulsating B-like pulsations and surface inhomogeneous distribution of\nvarious chemical elements. Methods. Classical frequency analysis methods were\nused to detect line profile variability and to determine the variation period.\nDoppler imaging reconstruction was performed to obtain abundance maps of\nchemical elements on the stellar surface. Results. For HD 11753, which is the\nstar with the most pronounced variability, distinct spectral line profile\nchanges were detected for Ti, Sr, Y, Zr, and Hg, whereas for HD 53244 and HD\n221507 the most variable line profiles belong to the elements Hg and Y,\nrespectively. We derived rotation periods for all three stars from the\nvariations of radial velocities and equivalent widths of spectral lines\nbelonging to inhomogeneously distributed elements: P_rot (HD 11753)=9.54 d,\nP_rot (HD 53244)=6.16 d, and P_rot (HD 221507)=1.93 d. For HD 11753 the Doppler\nimaging technique was applied to derive the distribution of the most variable\nelements Ti, Sr, and Y using two datasets separated by ~65 days. Results of\nDoppler imaging reconstruction revealed noticeable changes in the surface\ndistributions of TiII, SrII, and YII between the datasets, indicating the\nhitherto not well understood physical processes in stars with radiative\nenvelopes that cause a rather fast dynamical chemical spot evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 15:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Proper\nmotions are derived by combining these observations with over 140 ground- and\nspace-based catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as\nunpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs.
