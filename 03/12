Sunil Chandran","title":"Boxicity and Poset Dimension","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"math.CO","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge\nset $E(G)$. A $k$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product of closed intervals\n$[a_1,b_1]\\times [a_2,b_2]\\times...\\times [a_k,b_k]$. The {\\it boxicity} of\n$G$, $\\boxi(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as\nthe intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes, i.e. each vertex is mapped to\na $k$-dimensional box and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their\ncorresponding boxes intersect. Let $\\poset=(S,P)$ be a poset where $S$ is the\nground set and $P$ is a reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive binary\nrelation on $S$. The dimension of $\\poset$, $\\dim(\\poset)$ is the minimum\ninteger $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total\norders. Let $G_\\poset$ be the \\emph{underlying comparability graph} of\n$\\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only\nif they are comparable in $\\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with\nthe same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first\nresult of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its\nunderlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset\n$\\poset$, $\\boxi(G_\\poset)/(\\chi(G_\\poset)-1) \\le \\dim(\\poset)\\le\n2\\boxi(G_\\poset)$, where $\\chi(G_\\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\\poset$\nand $\\chi(G_\\poset)\\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\\poset$ is a height-2\nposet, then $\\boxi(G_\\poset)\\le \\dim(\\poset)\\le 2\\boxi(G_\\poset)$ since the\nunderlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The\nsecond result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural\npartial order associated with the \\emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted\nas $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$\nwhich are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\\in V(G)$, there\nare two vertices $u_A\\in A$ and $u_B\\in B$ and $\\{u_A,v_B\\}$ is an edge in\n$G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let\n$\\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$\nthe set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that\n$\\frac{\\boxi(G)}{2} \\le \\dim(\\poset_c) \\le 2\\boxi(G)+4$. These results have\nsome immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\\dim(\\poset)\\le\n2\\boxi(G_\\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset\ndimension such as $\\dim(\\poset)\\le 2\\tw(G_\\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any\ngraph is known to be at most its $\\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the\nalready known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The\nboxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ is $O(\\Delta\\log^2\\Delta)$\nwhich is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\\Delta^2+2$. (2)\nThere exist graphs with boxicity $\\Omega(\\Delta\\log\\Delta)$. This disproves a\nconjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\\Delta)$. (3) There exists no\npolynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on\n$n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\\epsilon})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$,\nunless $NP=ZPP$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 16:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-12"}

Recent evidence shows that diversity\nwithin the cell population of a neoplasm, a pre-tumoural lession that can\ndevelop into a fully malignant tumour, is the best predictor for its evolving\ninto a tumour. By studying the dynamics of a population described by a\nmulti-type, population-size limited branching process in terms of the\nevolutionary formalism, we show some general principles regarding the\nprobability of a resident population to being invaded by a mutant population in\nterms of the number of types present in the population and their resilience.

We\nstudy the problem of finding the optimal input covariance that achieves ergodic\nsecrecy capacity subject to a power constraint where only statistical\ninformation about the eavesdropper channel is available at the transmitter.\nThis is a non-convex optimization problem that is in general difficult to\nsolve.

Instead, it might be a better\nalternative to redefine the meaning of physical reality. This is the objective\nof the paper. A consideration of the quantum measurement process, conditional\nprobabilities and some well-known typical quantum physical experiments provides\nthe reasoning for the following three hypotheses: (1) Prior to a first\nmeasurement, a physical system is not in a quantum state. (2) Physical reality\nis all that and only that about which (classical) information is available in\nthe universe. (3) Information creation is an independent process and is not\ncovered by the Schroedinger equation. It is the first step of the quantum\nmeasurement process and does not have a classical counterpart. The first\nhypothesis makes sense only if the quantum measurement process can be described\nwithout presupposing an initial state for the system under consideration. This\nbecomes possible by the objective conditional probabilities which represent the\ntransition probabilities between the outcomes of successive quantum\nmeasurements and have been introduced by the author in some recent papers. The\nsecond hypothesis holds as well in the classical case, but a certain\nincompleteness of reality is typical of quantum mechanics and the origin of\nmany quantum phenomena. Classically, the existence of a complete reality is\npresumed, and hypothesis 3 has no meaning then.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 18:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-12"}

For example, a large-scale genomic study of a disease may examine\nthousands of genes without hypothesizing that any specific gene is responsible\nfor the disease. In these studies, the objective is to explore a large number\nof possible factors (e.g. genes) in order to identify a small number that will\nbe considered in follow-up studies that tend to be more thorough and on smaller\nscales. For large-scale studies, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach\nbased on random partition models. Our model thus divides the set of candidate\nfactors into several subgroups according to their degrees of relevance, or\npotential effect, in relation to the outcome of interest. The model allows for\na latent rank to be assigned to each factor according to the overall potential\nimportance of its corresponding group. The posterior expectation or mode of\nthese ranks is used to set up a threshold for selecting potentially relevant\nfactors. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our approach could be quite\neffective in finding relevant genes compared to several alternative methods. We\napply our model to two large-scale studies.

The components of\nthe prominent stationary H-alpha and H-beta lines are mainly identified as\narising from three emitting regions: (i) a super-Eddington accretion disc wind,\nin the form of a broad component accounting for most of the mass loss from the\nsystem, (ii) a circumbinary disc of material that we presume is being excreted\nthrough the binary's L2 point, and (iii) the accretion disc itself as two\nremarkably persistent components. The accretion disc components move with a\nKeplerian velocity of ~600 km/s in the outer region of the disc. A direct\nresult of this decomposition is the determination of the accretion disc size,\nwhose outer radius attains ~8 R_sun in the case of Keplerian orbits around a\nblack hole mass of 10 M_sun. We determine an upper limit for the accretion disc\ninner to outer radius ratio in SS433, R_in/R_out ~ 0.2, independent of the mass\nof the compact object. The Balmer decrements, H-alpha/H-beta, are extracted\nfrom the appropriate stationary emission lines for each component of the\nsystem. The physical parameters of the gaseous components are derived. The\ncircumbinary ring decrement seems to be quite constant throughout precessional\nphase, implying a constant electron density of log N_e(cm^-3) ~ 11.5 for the\ncircumbinary disc. The accretion disc wind shows a larger change in its\ndecrements exhibiting a clear dependence on precessional phase, implying a\nsinusoid variation in its electron density log N_e(cm^-3) along our\nline-of-sight between 10 and 13.

Suppose that\nwe carry out a preliminary F test of the null hypothesis H_0: tau = 0 against\nthe alternative hypothesis H_1: tau not equal to 0. It is common statistical\npractice to then construct a confidence interval for theta with nominal\ncoverage 1-alpha, using the same data, based on the assumption that the\nselected model had been given to us a priori(as the true model).

Our aim is to compute this\nminimum coverage probability. It is straightforward to find an expression for\nthe coverage probability of this confidence interval that is a multiple\nintegral of dimension s+1. However, we derive a new elegant and\ncomputationally-convenient formula for this coverage probability. For s=2 this\nformula is a sum of a triple and a double integral and for all s>2 this formula\nis a sum of a quadruple and a double integral. This makes it easy to compute\nthe minimum coverage probability of the naive confidence interval, irrespective\nof how large s is. A very important practical application of this formula is to\nthe analysis of covariance. In this context, tau can be defined so that H_0\nexpresses the hypothesis of \"parallelism\". Applied statisticians commonly\nrecommend carrying out a preliminary F test of this hypothesis. We illustrate\nthe application of our formula with a real-life analysis of covariance data set\nand a preliminary F test for \"parallelism\".

The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim\napproximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution\nproperties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With\n$h_{11}(r)$, $h_{12}(r)$, and $h_{22}(r)$ the three pair correlation functions\nas functions of the separation $r$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and\nsolute, respectively), we find for $r \\geq 2$ lattice steps that\n$h_{22}(r)/h_{12}(r) \\equiv h_{12}(r)/h_{11}(r)$. This illustrates a general\ntheorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite $r$. The three\ncorrelation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation\nlength), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the\ndecay of $h_{22}(r)$ is much greater than that of $h_{12}(r)$, which in turn is\nmuch greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. As a consequence the amplitude of the\ndecay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The\neffective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at\nwhich the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in\nsimilar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial\ncoefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the\nsolvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes,\nevaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy\nof solvation at fixed pressure, $\\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \\Delta G_p^*\n\\equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the\npressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A\nlarge, positive $\\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus\nreflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the\nmajor contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the\nlow solubility (large positive $\\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable\nenthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in\nthe hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high\nsolubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 23:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

We\nuse a stacking analysis to determine the mean FIR properties of well defined\nsubsets of galaxies at flux levels well below the FIR catalogue detection\nlimits of SWIRE and other Spitzer surveys. We tabulate the contribution of\ndifferent subsets of galaxies to the FIR background at 70um and 160um. These\nlong wavelengths provide a good constraint on the bolometric, obscured\nemission. The large area provides good constraints at low z and in finer\nredshift bins than previous work. At all redshifts we find that the specific\nFIR Luminosity (sLFIR) decreases with increasing mass, following a trend\nL_FIR/M* propto M_* ^beta with beta =-0.38\\pm0.14. This is a more continuous\nchange than expected from the {Delucia2007} semi-analytic model suggesting\nmodifications to the feedback prescriptions. We see an increase in the sLFIR by\nabout a factor of ~100 from 0<z<2 and find that the sLFIR evolves as\n(1+z)^alpha with alpha=4.4\\pm0.3 for galaxies with 10.5 < log M*/Msun < 12.\nThis is considerably steeper than the {Delucia2007} semi-analytic model (alpha\n\\sim 2.5). When separating galaxies into early and late types on the basis of\nthe optical/IR spectral energy distributions we find that the decrease in sLFIR\nwith stellar mass is stronger in early type galaxies (beta ~ -0.46), while late\ntype galaxies exhibit a flatter trend (beta \\sim -0.15). The evolution is\nstrong for both classes but stronger for the early type galaxies. The early\ntypes show a trend of decreasing strength of evolution as we move from lower to\nhigher masses while the evolution of the late type galaxies has little\ndependence on stellar mass.

I show that the prior information about\nany type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to\nreformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the\ndiscrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this\nframework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal\nunambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider\ntwo cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2)\nAlternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this\ncase I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters\nand a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification\n(UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in\ncoherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The\npromise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the\ntask is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the\nreference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution\ndescribing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of\nunknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of\nbeamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can\nbe considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the\nreference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This\nperspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after\nthe measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.\nMoreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on\nthe performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the\nunambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I\ncharacterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in\noptimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is\nnecessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown\nnon-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement\ndevices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the\ndifference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled\ncase I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only\nonce. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device\nmust be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses\nwith unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2010 23:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-15"}

Our sample is complete to 1 Msun (excluding A\nand B-type stars that do not emit X-rays), making this the deepest study of the\nstellar properties and star formation history in Cyg OB2 to date. From Siess et\nal. (2000) isochrone fits to the near-IR color-magnitude diagram, we derive\nages of 3.5 (+0.75/-1.0) and 5.25 (+1.5/-1.0) Myrs for sources in the two\nfields, both with considerable spreads around the pre-MS isochrones. The\npresence of a stellar population somewhat older than the present-day O-type\nstars, also fits in with the low fraction of sources with inner circumstellar\ndisks (as traced by the K-band excess) that we find to be very low, but\nappropriate for a population of age ~5 Myrs. We also find that the region lacks\na population of highly embedded sources that is often observed in young star\nforming regions, suggesting star formation in the vicinity has declined. We\nmeasure the stellar mass functions in this limit and find a power-law slope of\nGamma = -1.09 +/- 0.13, in good agreement with the global mean value estimated\nby Kroupa (2002). A steepening of the slope at higher masses is observed and\nsuggested as due to the presence of the previous generation of stars that have\nlost their most massive members. Finally, combining our mass function and an\nestimate of the radial density profile of the association suggests a total mass\nof Cyg OB2 of ~3 x 10^4 Msun, similar to that of many of our Galaxy's most\nmassive star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 02:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The most\nconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary\nneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in\nour Galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per Myr per Milky Way\nEquivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 per\nMyr per MWEG to 1000 per Myr per MWEG. We convert coalescence rates into\ndetection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and\nprojected sensitivities for our Advanced detectors. Using the detector\nsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02\nper year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between\n0.0002 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the\nAdvanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range\nbetween 0.4 and 400 per year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 05:25:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 06:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Earlier, an example of fast\ndynamos in stretch shear and fold Anosov maps have been given by Gilbert [PRSA\n[1993)). In this paper, analytical solutions representing general turbulent\ndynamo filaments are obtained in resistive plasmas. When turbulent diffusivity\nis present and kinetic helicity vanishes, a fast dynamo mode is obtained, and\nthe Anosov eigenvalue obtained. The magnetic field lays down on a Frenet 2\nplane along the filaments embedded in a 3D flow. Curvature effects on fast\ndynamo are also investigate. In case of weak curvature filaments the one\ndimensional manifolds in plasmas present a fast dynamo action. A parallel\nresult has been obtained by Chicone et al [Comm Math Phys), in the case fast\ndynamo spectrum in two dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds of negative\nconstant curvature, called Anosov spaces. While problems of embedding may\nappear in their case here no embedding problems appear since the one\ndimensional curved plasmas are embedded in three dimensional Euclidean spaces.\nIn the examples considered here, equipartion between normal and binormal\ncomponents of the magnetic field components is considered.

In this paper, another\nanti-dynamo theorem, called Cowling's theorem, which states that axisymmetric\nmagnetic fields cannot support dynamo action, is carefully tested against thick\ntubular and curved Riemannian untwisted flows, as well as thin flux tubes in\ndiffusive and diffusionless media. In the non-diffusive media the Cowling's\ntheorem is not violated in thin Riemann-flat untwisted flux tubes, where the\nFrenet curvature is negative. Nevertheless the diffusion action in the thin\nflux tube leads to a a dynamo action driven by poloidal flows as shown by Love\nand Gubbins (Geophysical Res.) in the context of geodynamos. Actually it is\nshown that a slow dynamo action is obtained. In this case the Frenet and\nRiemann curvature still vanishes. In the case of magnetic filaments in\ndiffusive media dynamo action is obtained when the Frenet scalar curvature is\nnegative. Since the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the\nFrenet curvature of the magnetic flux tube axis, this result can be analogous\nto a recent result obtained by Chicone, Latushkin and Smith, which states that\ngeodesic curvature in compact Riemannian manifolds can drive dynamo action in\nthe manifold. It is also shown that in absence of diffusion, magnetic energy\ndoes not grow but magnetic toroidal magnetic field can be generated by the\npoloidal field, what is called a plasma dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 06:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-15"}

The single degenerate scenario (a white\ndwarf accreting from a late main sequence or red giant companion) is tested\nagainst the double degenerate scenario (the spiral-in and merging of two white\ndwarfs through the emission of gravitational wave radiation). We use a\npopulation number synthesis code incorporating the latest physical results in\nbinary evolution, and allowing to differentiate between certain physical\nscenarios (e.g. description of common envelope evolution) and evolutionary\nparameters (e.g. mass transfer efficiency during Roche lobe overflow). The\nobtained theoretical distributions of the delay times of type Ia supernovae are\ncompared to those which are observed, both in morphological shape and absolute\nnumber of events. The critical dependency of these distributions on certain\nparameters is used to constrain the values of the latter. We find that the\nsingle degenerate scenario alone cannot explain the morphological shape of the\nobservational delay time distribution, while the double degenerate scenario (or\na combination of both) can. Most of these double degenerate type Ia supernovae\nare created through a normal quasi-conservative Roche lobe overflow followed by\na common envelope phase, not through two successive common envelope phases.\nThis may cast doubt on the use in other studies of analytical formalisms to\ndetermine delay times. In terms of absolute number, theoretical supernova Ia\nrates in old elliptical galaxies lie a factor of at least three below the\nobserved ones.

In\nour representative sample of extended and non-extended UV discs we find that\nhalf of the extended UV discs also exhibit extended Halpha emission. We find\nthat extended UV discs fall into two categories, those with a sharp truncation\nin the Halpha disc close to the optical edge (R25), and those with extended\nemission in Halpha as well as in the ultraviolet. Although most galaxies with\nstrong Halpha truncations near R25 show a significant corresponding falloff in\nUV emission (factor 10--100), the transition tends to be much smoother than in\nHalpha, and significant UV emission often extends well beyond this radius,\nconfirming earlier results by Thilker et al. (2007) and others. After\ncorrecting for dust attenuation the median fraction of total FUV emission from\nregions outside of R25 is 1.7%, but it can be as high as 35% in the most\nextreme cases. The corresponding fractions of Halpha emission are approximately\nhalf as large on average. This difference reflects both a slightly lower ratio\nof Halpha to UV emission in the HII regions in the outer discs, as well as a\nlower fraction of star clusters showing HII regions. Most HII regions in the\nextended disc have fluxes consistent with small numbers of ionising O-type\nstars, and this poor sampling of the upper initial mass function in small\nclusters can probably account for the differences in the emission properties,\nconsistent with earlier conclusions by Zaritsky & Christlein (2007), without\nneeding to invoke a significant change in the stellar IMF itself.

As\nthe sunspot-related and non-sunspot related geomagnetic activity are caused by\ndifferent solar agents, related to the solar toroidal and poloidal fields,\nrespectively, we use their variations to derive the parameters of the solar\ndynamo transforming the poloidal field into toroidal field and back. We find\nthat in the last 12 cycles the solar surface meridional circulation varied\nbetween 5 and 20 m/s (averaged over latitude and over the sunspot cycle), the\ndeep circulation varied between 2.5 and 5.5 m/s, and the diffusivity in the\nwhole of the convection zone was ~10**8 m2/s. In the last 12 cycles solar\ndynamo has been operating in moderately diffusion dominated regime in the bulk\nof the convection zone. This means that a part of the poloidal field generated\nat the surface is advected by the meridional circulation all the way to the\npoles, down to the tachocline and equatorward to sunspot latitudes, while\nanother part is diffused directly to the tachocline at midlatitudes,\n\"short-circuiting\" the meridional circulation. The sunspot maximum is the\nsuperposition of the two surges of toroidal field generated by these two parts\nof the poloidal field, which is the explanation of the double peaks and the\nGnevyshev gap in sunspot maximum. Near the tachocline, dynamo has been\noperating in diffusion dominated regime in which diffusion is more important\nthan advection, so with increasing speed of the deep circulation the time for\ndiffusive decay of the poloidal field decreases, and more toroidal field is\ngenerated leading to a higher sunspot maximum. During the Maunder minimum the\ndynamo was operating in advection dominated regime near the tachocline, with\nthe transition from diffusion dominated to advection dominated regime caused by\na sharp drop in the surface meridional circulation which is in general the most\nimportant factor modulating the amplitude of the sunspot cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 12:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 22:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The light curves of some\nLSPs stars mimic an eclipsing binary with a pulsating red giant component. To\ntest this hypothesis, the observational data of two LSP variable red giants,\n77.7795.29 and 77.8031.42, discovered by the MACHO project from the LMC, are\ncollected and analyzed. The probable eclipsing features of the light curves are\nsimulated by the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. The simulation yields a contact\nand a semidetached geometry for the two systems, respectively. In addition, the\npulsation constant of the main pulsating component in each binary system is\nderived. By combining the results of the binary model and the pulsation\ncomponent, we investigate the feasibility of the pulsating binary model. It is\nfound that the radial velocity curve expected from the binary model has a much\nlarger amplitude than the observed one and a period double the observed one.\nFurthermore, the masses of the components based on the density derived from the\nbinary orbit solution are too low to be compatible with both the evolutionary\nstage and the high luminosity. Although the pulsation mode identified by the\npulsation constant which is dependent on the density from the binary-model is\nconsistent with the first or second overtone radial pulsation, we conclude that\nthe pulsating binary model is a defective model for the LSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 14:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 00:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

While these three systems have a range of magnetic fields from 13\nto 70 MG, and of late type secondaries (including a likely brown dwarf in\nSDSSJ121209.31+013627.7), the accretion rates are similar, and the UV\nobservations imply some mechanism is operating to create enhanced emission\nzones on the white dwarf. The UV variations match in phase to the two magnetic\npoles viewed in the optical in WX LMi and to the single poles evident in the\noptical in SDSSJ1212109.31+013627.7 and SDSSJ103100.55+202832.2. Simple spot\nmodels of the UV light curves show that if hot spots are responsible for the UV\nvariations, the temperatures are on the order of 10,000-14,000K. For the single\npole systems, the size of the FUV spot must be smaller than the NUV and in all\ncases, the geometry is likely more complicated than a simple circular spot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 15:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This argument seems to imply\nabsence of longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) which is, however, observed in\nmany materials and reproduced by standard semiclassical transport theory\napplied to particular metals. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition on\nthe shape of the Fermi surface for non-zero LMR. Although an anisotropic\nspectrum is a pre-requisite for LMR, not all types of anisotropy can give rise\nto the effect: a spectrum should not be separable in any sense. More precisely,\nthe combination $k_{\\rho}v_{\\phi}/v_{\\rho}$, where $k_\\rho$ is the radial\ncomponent of the momentum in a cylindrical system with the z-axis along the\nmagnetic field and $v_{\\rho} (v_{\\phi}$) is the radial (tangential) component\nof the velocity, should depend on the momentum along the field. For some\nlattice types, this condition is satisfied already at the level of\nnearest-neighbor hopping; for others, the required non-separabality occurs only\nif next-to-nearest-neighbor hopping is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 00:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
