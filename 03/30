In this paper we study the behaviour of the BE in hyperbolic maps\nthat are in contact with different environments. We analyse the emergence of\nthe different regimes and show that the behaviour of the decay rate of the BE\nis strongly dependent on the type of environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 16:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-15"}

The two main scientific ob jectives, the study of the Milky\nWay diffuse background and the detection of point sources, are complicated by\nthe lack of photons. That is why we need a powerful Poisson noise removal\nmethod on the sphere which is efficient on low count Poisson data. This paper\npresents a new multiscale decomposition on the sphere for data with Poisson\nnoise, called Multi-Scale Variance Stabilizing Transform on the Sphere\n(MS-VSTS). This method is based on a Variance Stabilizing Transform (VST), a\ntransform which aims to stabilize a Poisson data set such that each stabilized\nsample has a quasi constant variance. In addition, for the VST used in the\nmethod, the transformed data are asymptotically Gaussian. MS-VSTS consists of\ndecomposing the data into a sparse multi-scale dictionary like wavelets or\ncurvelets, and then applying a VST on the coefficients in order to get almost\nGaussian stabilized coefficients. In this work, we use the Isotropic\nUndecimated Wavelet Transform (IUWT) and the Curvelet Transform as spherical\nmulti-scale transforms. Then, binary hypothesis testing is carried out to\ndetect significant coefficients, and the denoised image is reconstructed with\nan iterative algorithm based on Hybrid Steepest Descent (HSD). To detect point\nsources, we have to extract the Galactic diffuse background: an extension of\nthe method to background separation is then proposed. In contrary, to study the\nMilky Way diffuse background, we remove point sources with a binary mask. The\ngaps have to be interpolated: an extension to inpainting is then proposed. The\nmethod, applied on simulated Fermi LAT data, proves to be adaptive, fast and\neasy to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 17:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We find that the full\nwidth at half maximum of the H-alpha profile has been decreasing with time for\nboth envelopes. In this connection, we briefly discuss Hirata's hypothesis of\nprecessing gaseous disk and possible alternative scenarios of the observed\nlong-term changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 17:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Quintessence fields in the dark energy regime and inflaton fields\nduring inflation often have a very large background field value. Thus any other\nfield with its mass dependent on the quintessence/inflaton background field\nvalue through a moderate coupling will become very massive during the dark\nenergy/inflation phase and its quantum corrections to the scalar effective\npotential will be suppressed. This concept is developed in this paper using the\ndecoupling theorem. The problem then reduces to a quantitative question of the\nsize of suppression effects within the parameter space of coupling constants,\nscalar field background value and renormalization scale. Some numerical\nexamples are presented both for inflation and quintessence, but the approach is\ngeneral and can be applied to any scalar field effective potential. The\nconsequences to dark energy of the decoupling effect developed here is that the\nquintessence field need not just be an incredibly weakly interacting field,\noften added as simply an add-on to generate dark energy and have no other\npurpose. Instead, this quintessence field could play a central role in the\nparticle physics dynamics at early times and then simply decouple at late times\nbefore the onset of the dark energy phase. For inflation a consequence is\ncoupling of the inflaton to other fields can be much larger in certain models,\nwithout needing supersymmetry to control quantum corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 18:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Stringy constructions of RS-like theories allow us to\ninvestigate the mass of these string states, which typically grows with a small\nfractional power of the number of colors N of the dual gauge theory. There are\ntwo known strong constraints on N for RS-like theories. The first arises from\ndemanding that the Standard Model gauge couplings do not have a Landau pole at\nlow scales. The second arises from demanding that the first-order confining\nphase transition in the early universe is able to proceed without leaving an\nempty universe, i.e. that the rate of bubble nucleation is not too small.

My strong interest in the above theorem is motivated by the fact\nthat it contradicts some of my isospectrality examples constructed on geodesic\nspheres and balls of certain harmonic manifolds. The authors overlooked that\nthe Lichnerowicz identity is not determined by the given spectral data, and so\nis the final crucial equation obtained by eliminating with the Lichnerowicz\nidentity. In short, the above theorem has falsely been established by\nspectrally undetermined identities which can not be computed (determined) by\nthe spectra of local geodesic spheres.

An electronic state in the N=0 Landau\nlevel consequently has three quantum numbers in addition to its guiding center\nlabel: its spin, its valley index $K$ or $K^{\\prime}$, and an orbital quantum\nnumber $n=0,1.$ The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the bilayer supports\na wide variety of broken-symmetry states in which the pseudospins associated\nthese three quantum numbers order in a manner that is dependent on both filling\nfactor $\\nu $ and the electric potential difference between the layers. In this\npaper, we study the case of $\\nu =-1$ in an external field strong enough to\nfreeze electronic spins. We show that an electric potential difference between\nlayers drives a series of transitions, starting from interlayer-coherent states\n(ICS) at small potentials and leading to orbitally coherent states (OCS) that\nare polarized in a single layer. Orbital pseudospins carry electric dipoles\nwith orientations that are ordered in the OCS and have Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions that can lead to spiral instabilities.

Detailed mapping of newly\nsynthesised material and its radioactive decay daughter products sheds light on\nthe explosion mechanism. This may reveal the geometry of the explosion and its\nconnection to the equatorial ring and the outer rings around SN 1987A. We have\nused integral field spectroscopy to image the supernova ejecta and the\nequatorial ring in the emission lines of [Si I]+[Fe II] and He I. The spectral\ninformation can be mapped into a radial velocity image revealing the expansion\nof the ejecta both as projected onto the sky and perpendicular to the sky\nplane. The inner ejecta are spatially resolved in a North-South direction and\nare clearly asymmetric. We argue that the bulk of the ejecta is situated in the\nsame plane as defined by the equatorial ring and does not form a bipolar\nstructure as has been suggested. The exact shape of the ejecta is modelled and\nwe find that an elongated triaxial ellipsoid fits the observations best. From\nour spectral analyses of the ejecta spectrum we find that most of the He I, [Si\nI] and [Fe I-II] emission originates in the core material which has undergone\nexplosive nucleosynthesis. The He I emission may be the result of alpha-rich\nfreeze-out if the positron energy is deposited locally. Our observations\nclearly indicate a non-symmetric explosion mechanism for SN 1987A. The\nelongation and velocity asymmetries point towards a large-scale spatial\nnon-spherical distribution as predicted in recent explosion models.

These results suggest that Einstein's treatment of Mercury dynamics\ncan be extended to almost any object in the Solar System. This fact does not\nexplain the existing order in the Solar System. Indeed, all planets lie in the\nsame (Sun's equatorial) plane and move in the same direction coinciding with\nthat for the rotating Sun.The same is true for regular satellites of heavy\nplanets and for planetary rings associated with these satellites.In addition to\nregular satellites, there are irregular satellites (and at least one irregular\n(Saturn) ring associated with such a satellite (Phoebe)) grouped in respective\nplanes (other than equatorial) in which they all move in \"wrong\" directions on\nstable orbits. These are located strictly outside of those for regular\nsatellites. This filling pattern is reminiscent to that in atomic mechanics.\nBased on the original Heisenberg's ideas, we develop quantum celestial\nmechanics explaining this filling pattern and that for rings of heavy planets.\nThe formalism takes essentially into account that planets and satellites are\nmoving on geodesics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 23:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

A set of\n20 double-peaked emitters have been monitored for nearly a decade in order to\nobserve long-term variations in the profiles of the double-peaked Balmer lines.\nVariations generally occur on timescales of years, and are attributed to\nphysical changes in the accretion disk. Here we characterize the variability of\na subset of seven double-peaked emitters in a model independent way. We find\nthat variability is caused primarily by the presence of one or more discrete\n\"lumps\" of excess emission; over a timescale of a year (and sometimes less)\nthese lumps change in amplitude and shape, but the projected velocity of these\nlumps changes over much longer timescales (several years). We also find that\nall of the objects exhibit red peaks that are stronger than the blue peak at\nsome epochs and/or blueshifts in the overall profile, contrary to the\nexpectations for a simple, circular accretion disk model, thus emphasizing the\nneed for asymmetries in the accretion disk. Comparisons with two simple models,\nan elliptical accretion disk and a circular disk with a spiral arm, are unable\nto reproduce all aspects of the observed variability, although both account for\nsome of the observed behaviors. Three of the seven objects have robust\nestimates of the black hole masses. For these objects the observed variability\ntimescale is consistent with the expected precession timescale for a spiral\narm, but incompatible with that of an elliptical accretion disk. We suggest\nthat with the simple modification of allowing the spiral arm to be fragmented,\nmany of the observed variability patterns could be reproduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 23:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this context, we conducted a multi-site campaign\non the accreting pulsator SDSS J161033.64-010223.3 (V386 Ser) using seven\nobservatories located around the world in May 2007 over a duration of 11 days.\nWe report the best fit periodicities here, which were also previously observed\nin 2004, suggesting their underlying stability. Although we did not uncover a\nsufficient number of independent pulsation modes for a unique seismological\nfit, our campaign revealed that the dominant pulsation mode at 609s is an\nevenly spaced triplet. The even nature of the triplet is suggestive of\nrotational splitting, implying an enigmatic rotation period of about 4.8 days.\nThere are two viable alternatives assuming the triplet is real: either the\nperiod of 4.8 days is representative of the rotation period of the entire star\nwith implications for the angular momentum evolution of these systems, or it is\nperhaps an indication of differential rotation with a fast rotating exterior\nand slow rotation deeper in the star. Investigating the possibility that a\nchanging period could mimic a triplet suggests that this scenario is\nimprobable, but not impossible.\n  Using time-series spectra acquired in May 2009, we determine the orbital\nperiod of SDSS J161033.64-010223.3 to be 83.8 +/- 2.9 min. Three of the\nobserved photometric frequencies from our May 2007 campaign appear to be linear\ncombinations of the 609s pulsation mode with the first harmonic of the orbital\nperiod at 41.5min. This is the first discovery of a linear combination between\nnonradial pulsation and orbital motion for a variable white dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 00:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In a companion paper (Rodney and Tonry, 2009) we introduced the SOFT\nmethod for analyzing SNe using direct comparison to template light curves, and\ndemonstrated its application for photometric SN classification. In this work we\nextend the SOFT method to derive estimates of redshift and luminosity distance\nfor Type Ia SNe, using light curves from the SDSS and SNLS surveys as a\nvalidation set. Redshifts determined by SOFT using light curves alone are\nconsistent with spectroscopic redshifts, showing a root-mean-square scatter in\nthe residuals of RMS_z=0.051. SOFT can also derive simultaneous redshift and\ndistance estimates, yielding results that are consistent with the currently\nfavored Lambda-CDM cosmological model.

Without access to any spectroscopic information, and even without\nany redshift priors from host galaxy photometry, SOFT can still measure\nreliable redshifts and distances, with an increase in the Hubble residuals to\n0.37 mags for the combined SDSS and SNLS data set.

On the other hand, the\nSaturnian regular satellite system has only one big icy body, Titan, and a\npopulation of much smaller icy moons. We have investigated the origin of these\nmajor differences between the Jovian and Saturnian satellite systems by\nsemi-analytically simulating the growth and orbital migration of\nproto-satellites in an accreting proto-satellite disk. We set up two different\ndisk evolution/structure models that correspond to Jovian and Saturnian\nsystems, by building upon previously developed models of an actively-supplied\nproto-satellite disk, the formation of gas giants, and observations of young\nstars. Our simulations extend previous models by including the (1) different\ntermination timescales of gas infall onto the proto-satellite disk and (2)\ndifferent evolution of a cavity in the disk, between the Jovian and Saturnian\nsystems. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations and show that in the case of\nthe Jovian systems, four to five similar-mass satellites are likely to remain\ntrapped in mean motion resonances. This orbital configuration is formed by type\nI migration, temporal stopping of the migration near the disk inner edge, and\nquick truncation of gas infall caused by Jupiter opening a gap in the Solar\nnebula. The Saturnian systems tend to end up with one dominant body in the\nouter regions caused by the slower decay of gas infall associated with global\ndepletion of the Solar nebula.

Here, we turn our attention\nto the latter idea to investigate the evolution of observed low-mass\ncondensations (LMCs) in the cores of molecular clouds. For this purpose, we\nimplement the evolution of the observed LMCs of Taurus molecular cloud~1\n(TMC-1). The core is modeled as a contracting cylinder with randomly spawned\ncondensations in the middle region around its axis. For advancing bodies in\ntheir trajectories, we represent the acceleration of a particular LMC in terms\nof a fourth-order polynomial using the predictor-corrector scheme. Whenever two\nLMCs collide, they are assumed to be merged in one large condensation\ncontaining all the masses of the two progenitors. Implementations of many\ncomputer experiments with a wide variety of the free parameters show that the\nLMCs merge to form star-forming regions in the core. The results show that the\ntotal mechanical energy of the core increases by time, and its rate of\nincreasing decreases by facilitating the merger. Finally, the mass spectrum\nindex and goodness-of-fit are determined with 50% error in the number of mass\npoints. The results show that the goodness-of-fit will be refined at the end of\nsimulations, and the mass spectrum index inclines to the observed values for\nthe moderate mass objects. The simulations show that the TMC-1 turns about 40%\nof its mass into cluster of dynamically unstable protostellar cores. In\ngeneral, we suggest that the future of LMCs in a core of molecular cloud is\nmerger to convert about half of its initial masses into a cluster of\ngravitationally unstable protostellar cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 06:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this paper, following\nthe basic assumption in the interpolation method that objects at the same\nredshift should have the same luminosity distance, we propose another approach\nto calibrate GRB luminosity relations with cosmographic fitting directly from\nSN Ia data. In cosmography, there is a well-known fitting formula which can\nreflect the Hubble relation between luminosity distance and redshift with\ncosmographic parameters which can be fitted from observation data. Using the\nCosmographic fitting results from the Union set of SNe Ia, we calibrate five\nGRB relations using GRB sample at $z\\leq1.4$ and deduce distance moduli of GRBs\nat $1.4< z \\leq 6.6$ by generalizing above calibrated relations at high\nredshift.

The fractional polarization of sources is almost\nindependent of frequency with a median of ~2 per cent and an average, for\ndetected sources, of ~3.5 per cent. These values are also independent of the\ntotal intensity over the narrow range of intensity we sample. Using a\ncontemporaneous sample of 105 sources detected at all 3 VLA frequencies, we\nhave investigated the spectral behaviour as a function of frequency by means of\na 2-colour diagram. Most sources have power-law spectra in total intensity, as\nexpected. On the other hand they appear to be almost randomly distributed in\nthe polarized intensity 2-colour diagram.

This apparent inconsistency is usually set aside\nby assuming that the flux is actually sub-Eddington and that the fitted\ntemperature is so high because the spectrum has been distorted by the\nenergy-dependent opacity of the atmosphere. Here we show that the spectra\npredicted by currently available conventional atmosphere models appear\nincompatible with the highest-precision measurements of burst spectra made\nusing the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, such as during the 4U 1820-30 superburst\nand a long burst from GX 17+2. In contrast, these measurements are well-fit by\nBose-Einstein spectra with high temperatures and modest chemical potentials.\nSuch spectra are very similar to Planck spectra. They imply surface radiative\nfluxes more than a factor of three larger than the Eddington flux. We find that\nsegments of many other bursts from many sources are well-fit by similar\nBose-Einstein spectra, suggesting that the radiative flux at the emitting\nsurface also exceeds the Eddington flux during these segments. We suggest that\nburst spectra can closely approximate Bose-Einstein spectra and have fluxes\nthat exceed the Eddington flux because they are formed by Comptonization in an\nextended, low-density radiating gas supported by the outward radiation force\nand confined by a tangled magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 15:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 17:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The Bayesian paradigm is used and, for each given graph, a\nhyper inverse Wishart prior distribution on the covariance matrix is\nconsidered. This prior distribution depends on hyper-parameters. It is\nwell-known that the models's posterior distribution is sensitive to the\nspecification of these hyper-parameters and no completely satisfactory method\nis registered. In order to avoid this problem, we suggest adopting an empirical\nBayes strategy, that is a strategy for which the values of the hyper-parameters\nare determined using the data. Typically, the hyper-parameters are fixed to\ntheir maximum likelihood estimations. In order to calculate these maximum\nlikelihood estimations, we suggest a Markov chain Monte Carlo version of the\nStochastic Approximation EM algorithm. Moreover, we introduce a new sampling\nscheme in the space of graphs that improves the add and delete proposal of\nArmstrong et al. (2009).

We performed a new determination of\nmean positions and proper motions on the ICRS system by combining USNO-B1.0 and\n2MASS astrometry. This catalog is called PPMXL {VO-access to the catalog is\npossible via http://vo.uni-hd.de/ppmxl}, and it aims to be complete from the\nbrightest stars down to about $V \\approx 20$ full-sky. PPMXL contains about 900\nmillion objects, some 410 million with 2MASS photometry, and is the largest\ncollection of ICRS proper motions at present. As representative for the ICRS we\nchose PPMX. The recently released UCAC3 could not be used because we found\nplate-dependent distortions in its proper motion system north of -20$^\\circ$\ndeclination. UCAC3 served as an intermediate system for $\\delta \\leq\n-20^\\circ$. The resulting typical individual mean errors of the proper motions\nrange from 4 mas/y to more than 10 mas/y depending on observational history.\nThe mean errors of positions at epoch 2000.0 are 80 to 120 mas, if 2MASS\nastrometry could be used, 150 to 300 mas else.
