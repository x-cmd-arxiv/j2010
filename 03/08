A static web service\ndiscovery mechanism is not only time consuming but requires continuous human\ninteraction. This paper proposed an efficient dynamic web services discovery\nmechanism that can locate relevant and updated web services from service\nregistries and repositories with timestamp based on indexing value and\ncategorization for faster and efficient discovery of service. The proposed\nprototype focuses on quality of service issues and introduces concept of local\ncache, categorization of services, indexing mechanism, CSP (Constraint\nSatisfaction Problem) solver, aging and usage of translator. Performance of\nproposed framework is evaluated by implementing the algorithm and correctness\nof our method is shown. The results of proposed framework shows greater\nperformance and accuracy in dynamic discovery mechanism of web services\nresolving the existing issues of flexibility, scalability, based on quality of\nservice, and discovers updated and most relevant services with ease of usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 18:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-28"}

The case of non-monotone submodular maximization is less\nunderstood: the first approximation algorithms even for the unconstrainted\nsetting were given by Feige et al. (FOCS '07). More recently, Lee et al. (STOC\n'09, APPROX '09) show how to approximately maximize non-monotone submodular\nfunctions when the constraints are given by the intersection of p matroid\nconstraints; their algorithm is based on local-search procedures that consider\np-swaps, and hence the running time may be n^Omega(p), implying their algorithm\nis polynomial-time only for constantly many matroids. In this paper, we give\nalgorithms that work for p-independence systems (which generalize constraints\ngiven by the intersection of p matroids), where the running time is poly(n,p).\nOur algorithm essentially reduces the non-monotone maximization problem to\nmultiple runs of the greedy algorithm previously used in the monotone case.\n  Our idea of using existing algorithms for monotone functions to solve the\nnon-monotone case also works for maximizing a submodular function with respect\nto a knapsack constraint: we get a simple greedy-based constant-factor\napproximation for this problem.\n  With these simpler algorithms, we are able to adapt our approach to\nconstrained non-monotone submodular maximization to the (online) secretary\nsetting, where elements arrive one at a time in random order, and the algorithm\nmust make irrevocable decisions about whether or not to select each element as\nit arrives.

It turns out that the angular momentum of the ionized\nstellar winds from orbiting stars in one or two disks orbiting Sgr A* could be\na critical factor in estimating accurately the accretion rate unto Sgr A*. A\nnet angular momentum of ionized gas feeding Sgr A* could lower the Bondi rate.\nFurthermore, the recent time delay picture of the peak flare emission can be\nunderstood in the context of adiabatic expansion of hot plasma. The expansion\nspeed of the plasma is estimated to be sub-relativistic. However, relativistic\nbulk motion of the plasma could lead to outflow from Sgr A*. Significant\noutflow from Sgr A* could then act as a feedback which could then reduce Bondi\naccretion rate. These uncertain factors can in part explain the underluminous\nnature of Sgr A*. The other issue is related to the emission mechanism and the\ncause of flare activity in different wavelength bands. Modeling of X-ray and\nnear-IR flares suggests that inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of IR flare\nphotons by the energetic electrons responsible for the submm emission can\naccount for the X-ray flares. A time delay of minutes to tens of minutes is\npredicted between the peak flaring in the near-IR and X-rays, NOT due to\nadiabatic expansion of optically thick hot plasma, but to the time taken for IR\nflare photons to cross the accretion flow before being upscattered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 19:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We carried out a comprehensive analysis of 118 solar\nanalogs and reported that a close connection exists between the Li abundance\nA_Li and the line-broadening width (v_r+m; mainly contributed by rotational\neffect), which led us to conclude that stellar rotation may be the primary\ncontrol of the surface Li content. To examine our claim in more detail, we\nstudy whether the degree of stellar activity exhibits a similar correlation\nwith the Li abundance, which is expected because of the widely believed close\nconnection between rotation and activity. We measured the residual flux at the\nline center of the strong Ca II 8542 line, r_0(8542), known to be a useful\nindex of stellar activity, for all sample stars using newly acquired spectra in\nthis near-IR region. The projected rotational velocity (v_e sin i) was\nestimated by subtracting the macroturbulence contribution from v_r+m that we\nhad already established. A remarkable (positive) correlation was found in the\nA_Li versus (vs.) r_0(8542) diagram as well as in both the r_0(8542) vs. v_e\nsin i and A_Li vs. v_e sin i diagrams, as had been expected. With the\nconfirmation of rotation-dependent stellar activity, this clearly shows that\nthe surface Li abundances of these solar analogs progressively decrease as the\nrotation rate decreases. Given this observational evidence, we conclude that\nthe depletion of surface Li in solar-type stars, probably caused by effective\nenvelope mixing, operates more efficiently as stellar rotation decelerates. It\nmay be promising to attribute the low-Li tendency of planet-host G dwarfs to\ntheir different nature in the stellar angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2010 07:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In the distributed vertex coloring\nproblem the objective is to color G with Delta + 1, or slightly more than Delta\n+ 1, colors using as few rounds of communication as possible. (The number of\nrounds of communication will be henceforth referred to as running time.)\nEfficient randomized algorithms for this problem are known for more than twenty\nyears \\cite{L86, ABI86}. Specifically, these algorithms produce a (Delta +\n1)-coloring within O(log n) time, with high probability. On the other hand, the\nbest known deterministic algorithm that requires polylogarithmic time employs\nO(Delta^2) colors. This algorithm was devised in a seminal FOCS'87 paper by\nLinial \\cite{L87}. Its running time is O(log^* n). In the same paper Linial\nasked whether one can color with significantly less than Delta^2 colors in\ndeterministic polylogarithmic time.
