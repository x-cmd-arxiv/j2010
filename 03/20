If all, say t, maximal monomials of X\nhave the same degree, then X is pure (of type t). A pure O-sequence is the\nvector, h=(1,h_1,...,h_e), counting the monomials of X in each degree.\nEquivalently, in the language of commutative algebra, pure O-sequences are the\nh-vectors of monomial Artinian level algebras. Pure O-sequences had their\norigin in one of Richard Stanley's early works in this area, and have since\nplayed a significant role in at least three disciplines: the study of\nsimplicial complexes and their f-vectors, level algebras, and matroids. This\nmonograph is intended to be the first systematic study of the theory of pure\nO-sequences. Our work, making an extensive use of algebraic and combinatorial\ntechniques, includes: (i) A characterization of the first half of a pure\nO-sequence, which gives the exact converse to an algebraic g-theorem of Hausel;\n(ii) A study of (the failing of) the unimodality property; (iii) The problem of\nenumerating pure O-sequences, including a proof that almost all O-sequences are\npure, and the asymptotic enumeration of socle degree 3 pure O-sequences of type\nt; (iv) The Interval Conjecture for Pure O-sequences (ICP), which represents\nperhaps the strongest possible structural result short of an (impossible?)\ncharacterization; (v) A pithy connection of the ICP with Stanley's matroid\nh-vector conjecture; (vi) A specific study of pure O-sequences of type 2,\nincluding a proof of the Weak Lefschetz Property in codimension 3 in\ncharacteristic zero. As a corollary, pure O-sequences of codimension 3 and type\n2 are unimodal (over any field); (vii) An analysis of the extent to which the\nWeak and Strong Lefschetz Properties can fail for monomial algebras; (viii)\nSome observations about pure f-vectors, an important special case of pure\nO-sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 16:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 23:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

At the dynamical level, the transition corresponds to\na collapse of the excitation spectrum at a critical point. At the static level,\nthe transition affects the ground state wavefunction: while in some cases it\ncould be picked up by the expectation value of a local operator, in others the\norder may be non-local, and impossible to be determined with any local probe.\nHere we propose instead to use concepts from quantum information theory that\nare not centered around local order parameters, such as fidelity and\nentanglement measures. We show that for systems derived from the mapping of\nclassical stochastic dynamics, singularities in the fidelity susceptibility\ntranslate directly into singularities in the heat capacity of the classical\nsystem. In classical glassy systems with an extensive number of metastable\nstates, we find that the prefactor of the area law term in the entanglement\nentropy jumps across the transition. We also discuss how entanglement measures\ncan be used to detect a growing correlation length that diverges at the\ntransition.

The\ndynamics of non-inertial sedimenting particles is shown to be chaotic, under\nthe combined effect of gravity and of the circular displacement of the\nvortices. This phenomenon is very sensitive to particle inertia, if any. By\nusing nearly hamiltonian dynamical system theory for the particle motion\nequation written in the rotating reference frame, one can show that small\ninertia terms of the particle motion equation strongly modify the Melnikov\nfunction of the homoclinic trajectories and heteroclinic cycles of the\nunperturbed system, as soon as the particle response time is of the order of\nthe settling time (Froude number of order unity). The critical Froude number\nabove which chaotic motion vanishes and a regular centrifugation takes place is\nobtained from this Melnikov analysis and compared to numerical simulations.\nParticles with a finite inertia, and in the absence of gravity, are not\nnecessarily centrifugated away from the vortex system. Indeed, these particles\ncan have various equilibrium positions in the rotating reference frame, like\nthe Lagrange points of celestial mechanics, according to whether their Stokes\nnumber is smaller or larger than some critical value. An analytical stability\nanalysis reveals that two of these points are stable attracting points, so that\npermanent trapping can occur for inertial particles injected in an isolated\nco-rotating vortex pair. Particle trapping is observed to persist when\nviscosity, and therefore vortex coalescence, is taken into account. Numerical\nexperiments at large but finite Reynolds number show that particles can indeed\nbe trapped temporarily during vortex roll-up, and are eventually centrifugated\naway once vortex coalescence occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 17:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We find that these deviations originate from\ncorrelations between two quantities entering the definition of spin, namely the\nratio $J/M^{5/2}$ (which depends only on mass) and the total gravitational\nbinding energy $E$. To reach this conclusion, we have made usage of the results\ndeduced from two high spatial- and mass resolution simulations. Our simulations\ncover a relatively small volume and produce a sample of more than 16.000\ngravitationally bound halos, each traced by at least 300 particles. We verify\nthat our results are stable to different systematics, by comparing our results\nwith those derived by the GIF2 and by a more recent simulation performed by\nMaccio' et al. We find that the spin probability distribution function shows\nsystematic deviations from a lognormal, at all redshifts z <= 1. These\ndeviations depend on mass and redshift: at small masses they change little with\nredshift, and also the best lognormal fits are more stable. The J-M\nrelationship is well described by a power law of exponent $\\alpha$ very near to\nthe linear theory prediction (alpha=5/3), but systematically lower than this at\nz<= 0.3. We argue that the fact that deviations from a lognormal PDF are\npresent only for high-spin halos could point to a role of large-scale tidal\nfields in the evolution of the spin PDF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 20:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 14:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 09:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

While most studies of crowd behavior\nconsider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to\n70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends,\ncouples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale\naggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely\nunknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian\ngroups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group\nmembers generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics.\nAt low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line\nperpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the\nlinear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern.\nThese spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social\ncommunication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern\nfacilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because\nof its \"non-aerodynamic\" shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the\ngroup organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and\nfacilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is\nnot only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and\nthe environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions\namong individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 22:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It is shown that, with some plausible\nassumptions, including the projectability of the lapse function, this model is\nconsistent. As a large class of such theories, the modified HL $F(R)$ gravity\nis introduced.

Based on the perturbative calculations and\nphenomenological analysis, we find the following results: (i) the CP-averaged\nBRs of the considered sixty two $B_c$ decays are in the range of $10^{-5}$ to\n$10^{-9}$; (ii) since the behavior for $^1P_1$ meson is much different from\nthat of $^3P_1$ meson, the BRs of $B_c \\to A(^1P_1) (V, A(^1P_1))$ decays are\ngenerally larger than that of $B_c \\to A(^3P_1) (V, A(^3P_1))$ decays in the\npQCD approach; (iii) many considered decays modes, such as $B_c\\to a_1(1260)^+\n\\omega$, $b_1(1235) \\rho$, etc, have sizable BRs within the reach of the LHCb\nexperiments; (iv) the longitudinal polarization fractions of most considered\ndecays are large and play the dominant role; (v) the pQCD predictions for\nseveral decays involving mixtures of $^3P_1$ and/or $^1P_1$ mesons are highly\nsensitive to the values of the mixing angles, which will be tested by the\nongoing LHC and forthcoming Super-B experiments; (vi) the CP-violating\nasymmetries of these considered $B_c$ decays are absent in the standard model\nbecause only one type tree operator is involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2010 13:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 08:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Lett. A 373 (2009) 2338-2342]. Also, in\nconsidering the questions, \"Why random?\" and \"Why pulses?\", we show that the\nrandom pulse based scheme provides the advantages of realizing multivalued\ndeterministic logic. Pulse trains are realized by an element called\northogonator. We discuss two different types of orthogonators, parallel\n(intersection-based) and serial (demultiplexer-based) orthogonators. The last\none can be slower but it makes sequential logic design straightforward. We\npropose generating a multidimensional logic hyperspace [Physics Letters A 373\n(2009) 1928-1934] by using the zero-crossing events of uncorrelated Gaussian\nelectrical noises available in the chips. The spike trains in the hyperspace\nare non-overlapping, and are referred to as neuro-bits. To demonstrate this\nidea, we generate 3-dimensional hyperspace bases using 2 Gaussian noises as\nsources for neuro-bits, respectively. In such a scenario, the detection of\ndifferent hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show\nthat it is possible to provide an identical speed for all the hyperspace bases\nelements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the 2\nneuro-bits situations. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a\nlogic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power\nprocessing and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer\ncircuitry. It also enables the realization of multi-valued logic, significantly\nincreasing the complexity of computer circuits by allowing several neuro-bits\nto be transmitted on a single wire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2010 15:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

In spite of spatial fluctuations of the\ncritical current density on the macroscopic scale, it is shown that the major\ncontribution comes from collective pinning of vortex lines by microscopic\ndefects by the mean-free path fluctuation mechanism. The defect density\nextracted from experiment corresponds to the dopant atom density, which means\nthat dopant atoms play an important role both in vortex pinning and in\nquasiparticle scattering. In the studied underdoped PrFeAsO_1-y and NdFeAs(O,F)\ncrystals, there is a background of strong pinning, which we attribute to\nspatial variations of the dopant atom density on the scale of a few dozen to\none hundred nm. These variations do not go beyond 5% - we therefore do not find\nany evidence for coexistence of the superconducting and the antiferromagnetic\nphase. The critical current density in sub-T fields is characterized by the\npresence of a peak effect, the location of which in the (B,T)-plane is\nconsistent with an order-disorder transition of the vortex lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2010 15:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-21"}
