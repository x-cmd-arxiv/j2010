These stars are classified as CSPNe of a spectral type [WC]. We\nperform a spectral analysis of CSPN PB 8 with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)\nmodels for expanding atmospheres. The source PB 8 displays wind-broadened\nemission lines from strong mass loss. Most strikingly, we find that its surface\ncomposition is hydrogen-deficient, but not carbon-rich. With mass fractions of\n55% helium, 40% hydrogen, 1.3% carbon, 2% nitrogen, and 1.3% oxygen, it differs\ngreatly from the 30-50% of carbon which are typically seen in [WC]-type central\nstars. The atmospheric mixture in PB 8 has an analogy in the WN/WC transition\ntype among the massive Wolf-Rayet stars. Therefore we suggest to introduce a\nnew spectral type [WN/WC] for CSPNe, with PB 8 as its first member.

In this approximation, the initial\nabundances chosen, which are totally atomic in nature except for molecular\nhydrogen, are artificial. A more detailed approach to the chemistry of dense\ncold cores should include the physical evolution during their early stages of\nformation. Aims: Our major goal is to investigate the initial synthesis of\nmolecular ices and gas-phase molecules as cold molecular gas begins to form\nbehind a shock in the diffuse interstellar medium. The abundances calculated as\nthe conditions evolve can then be utilized as reasonable initial conditions for\na theory of the chemistry of dense cores. Methods: Hydrodynamic shock-wave\nsimulations of the early stages of cold core formation are used to determine\nthe time-dependent physical conditions for a gas-grain chemical network. We\nfollow the cold post-shock molecular evolution of ices and gas-phase molecules\nfor a range of visual extinction up to AV ~ 3, which increases with time. At\nhigher extinction, self-gravity becomes important. Results: As the newly\ncondensed gas enters its cool post-shock phase, a large amount of CO is\nproduced in the gas. As the CO forms, water ice is produced on grains, while\naccretion of CO produces CO ice. The production of CO2 ice from CO occurs via\nseveral surface mechanisms, while the production of CH4 ice is slowed by\ngas-phase conversion of C into CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 18:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

By transforming space and light propagation, a\nthree-dimensional (3D) object can be perceived as having reduced number of\ndimensions, in the form of points, lines, and thin sheets, making it\n\"undetectable\" judging from scattered field. Although a variety of cloaking\ndevices have been reported at microwave and optical frequencies, the Terahertz\n(THz) domain remains unexplored. Moreover, it should be noted that all the\nprevious experimental demonstrations are performed in a two-dimensional (2D)\nwaveguide configuration. Although those works represent a critical step in\nvalidating the concept of the invisibility cloak, one would expect the cloaking\ndevice to be realized in 3D with the ability to cloak an object of realistic\nsize. This requires the construction of an optically large cloaking device with\nfeatures much smaller than the wavelength. Fabricating 3D structures with\naspect ratio close to 100:1 is obviously a challenging task. Here, we report an\nexperimental demonstration of a 3D THz ground plane cloak. Reflection terahertz\ntime-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed to characterize the cloaking\nsamples. Two distinct reflection peaks can be clearly observed across a broad\nfrequency range, which is caused by the reflection at the surface of the bump.\nThe measured peak positions are consistent with the numerical simulation peak\npositions. By contrast, in the spectral map of the cloak sample, the wavefront\nis relatively smooth with a single peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 19:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-18"}

The chemical abundances of second-generation (SG)\nstars constrain the sources of gas out of which these stars must have formed,\nindicating that the gas must contain matter processed through the\nhigh-temperature CNO cycle. First-generation massive Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) stars have been proposed as the source of this gas. In a previous study,\nby means of hydrodynamical and N-body simulations, we have shown that the AGB\nejecta collect in a cooling flow in the cluster core, where the gas reaches\nhigh densities, ultimately forming a centrally concentrated subsystem of SG\nstars. In this Letter we show that the high gas density can also lead to\nsignificant accretion onto a pre-existing seed black hole. We show that gas\naccretion can increase the black hole mass by up to a factor of 100. The\ndetails of the gas dynamics are important in determining the actual black hole\ngrowth. Assuming a near-universal seed black hole mass and small\ncluster-to-cluster variations in the duration of the SG formation phase, the\noutcome of our scenario is one in which the present intermediate-mass black\nhole (IMBH) mass may have only a weak dependence on the current cluster\nproperties. The scenario presented provides a natural mechanism for the\nformation of an IMBH at the cluster center during the SG star-formation phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 20:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For the C/H gradient the results are inconclusive with\nregards to yields and star formation. The C/Fe and O/Fe vs. Fe/H, as well as\nC/O vs. O/H trends predicted by the models for the solar neighbourhood zone\nwere compared with stellar abundances from the literature. For O/Fe vs. Fe/H\nall models fit the data, but for C/O vs. O/H, only models with increased carbon\nyields for zero-metallicity stars or an evolving initial mass function provide\ngood fits. Furthermore, a steep star formation threshold in the disc can be\nruled out since it predicts a steep fall-off in all abundance gradients beyond\na certain galactocentric distance (~ 13 kpc) and cannot explain the possible\nflattening of the C/H and Fe/H gradients in the outer disc seen in\nobservations. Since in the best-fit models the enrichment scenario is such that\ncarbon is primarily produced in low-mass stars, it is suggested that in every\nenvironment where the peak of star formation happened a few Gyr back in time,\nwinds of carbon-stars are responsible for most of the carbon enrichment.\nHowever, a significant contribution by zero-metallicity stars, especially at\nvery early stages, and by winds of high-mass stars, which are increasing in\nstrength with metallicity, cannot be ruled out by the CEMs presented here.

This algorithms are used in the new\napproach to compute the whole global or local Bernstein-Sato polynomial and\n$b$-function of a holonomic ideal with respect to weights. They are applied in\nnumerous situations, where there is a possibility to compute an upper bound for\nthe polynomial.

The large wavelength range of these observations and the\navailability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify the\npeak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um. The SEDs of both\ngalaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies with\nL_IR ~ 10^{11} L_{sun} -- 10^{12} L_{sun} yet both galaxies have L_{IR} ~\n10^{13} L_{sun}. This suggests that these galaxies are not high redshift\nanalogues of the Hyper-LIRGs/ULIRGs used in local templates, but are instead\n\"scaled up\" versions of local ULIRGs/LIRGs. For both galaxies the star\nformation rate determined from the best-fit FIR SEDs (SFR(L_{IR})) agrees with\nthe SFR determined from the dust corrected H-alpha luminosity (SFR(H-alpha)) to\nwithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the SFR of these galaxies is estimated\nusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependent\ntemplate method (SFR(24um)), it systematically overestimates the SFR by as much\nas a factor of 6.

After analyzing the various\ncorrelations among the global far-infrared (FIR), RC, CO, and HCN luminosities\nand their various ratios, we conclude that the FIR-RC and FIR-HCN correlations\nappear to be linear and are the tightest among all correlations. The\ncombination of these two correlations could result in the tight RC-HCN\ncorrelation we observed. Meanwhile, the non-linear RC-CO correlation shows\nslightly larger scatter as compared with the RC-HCN correlation, and there is\nno correlation between ratios of either RC/HCN-CO/HCN or RC/FIR-CO/FIR. In\ncomparison, a meaningful correlation is still observed between ratios of\nRC/CO-HCN/CO. Nevertheless, the correlation between RC/FIR and HCN/FIR also\ndisappears, reflecting again the two tightest FIR-RC and FIR-HCN correlations\nas well as suggesting that FIR seems to be the bridge that connects HCN with\nRC. Interestingly, despite obvious HCN-RC and RC-CO correlations,\nmulti-parameter fits hint that while both RC and HCN contribute significantly\n(with no contribution from CO) to FIR, yet RC is primarily determined from FIR\nwith a very small contribution from CO and essentially no contribution from\nHCN. These analyses confirm independently the former conclusions that it is\npractical to use RC luminosity instead of FIR luminosity, at least globally, as\nan indicator of star formation rate in galaxies including LIRGs/ULIRGs, and HCN\nis a much better tracer of star-forming molecular gas and correlates with FIR\nmuch better than that of CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 03:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Natural roads\nare joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity. This\napproach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road\nsegments for computing routes or map directions. Because of this, the derived\nroutes posses the fewest turns. However, what we intend to achieve are the\nroutes that not only possess the fewest turns, but are also as short as\npossible. This kind of map direction is more effective and favorable by people,\nbecause they bear less cognitive burden. Furthermore, the computation of the\nroutes is more efficient, since it is based on the graph encoding the\nconnectivity of roads, which is significantly smaller than the graph of road\nsegments. We made experiments applied to eight urban street networks from North\nAmerica and Europe in order to illustrate the above stated advantages. The\nexperimental results indicate that the fewest-turn routes posses fewer turns\nand shorter distances than the simplest paths and the routes provided by Google\nMaps.

However, its cosmological distance has not\nbeen reported so far, because of its optical faintness produced by strong\nGalactic extinction.\n  Aims. Aiming at measuring the redshift of NRAO 150, and hence to start making\npossible quantitative studies from the source.\n  Methods. We have conducted spectroscopic and photometric observations of the\nsource in the near-IR, as well as in the optical.\n  Results. All such observations have been successful in detecting the source.\nThe near-IR spectroscopic observations reveal strong H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$\nemission lines from which the cosmological redshift of NRAO 150\n($z=1.517\\pm0.002$) has been determined for the first time. We classify the\nsource as a flat-spectrum radio-loud quasar, for which we estimate a large\nsuper-massive black-hole mass $\\sim5\\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. After\nextinction correction, the new near-IR and optical data have revealed a\nhigh-luminosity continuum-emission excess in the optical (peaking at\n$\\sim2000$\\,\\AA, rest frame) that we attribute to thermal emission from the\naccretion disk for which we estimate a high accretion rate, $\\sim30$\\,% of the\nEddington limit.\n  Conclusions. Comparison of these source properties, and its broad-band\nspectral-energy distribution, with those of Fermi blazars allow us to predict\nthat NRAO 150 is among the most powerful blazars, and hence a high luminosity\n-although not detected yet- $\\gamma$-ray emitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 10:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We present an\ninvestigation of the atmospheric parameters, state of evolution and high-energy\nfluxes of the nearby star kap^1 Cet, previously thought to have properties\nresembling those of the early Sun. Atmospheric parameters were derived from the\nexcitation/ionization equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II, profile fitting of Halpha\nand the spectral energy distribution. The UV irradiance was derived from FUSE\nand HST data, and the absolute chromospheric flux from the Halpha line core.\nFrom careful spectral analysis and the comparison of different methods we\npropose for kap^1 Cet the following atmospheric parameters: Teff = 5665+/-30 K\n(Halpha profile and energy distribution), log g = 4.49+/-0.05 dex (evolutionary\nand spectroscopic) and [Fe/H] = +0.10+/-0.05 dex (Fe II lines).

This star is thus a very close analog of the Sun when life arose on\nEarth and Mars is thought to have lost its surface bodies of liquid water.\nPhotochemical models indicate that the enhanced UV emission leads to a\nsignificant increase in photodissociation rates compared with those commonly\nassumed of the early Earth. Our results show that reliable calculations of the\nchemical composition of early planetary atmospheres need to account for the\nstronger solar photodissociating UV irradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 11:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2010 14:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Determination of\nstellar parameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-quality\nVLT/UVES spectra. The surface gravity was calculated from the NLTE ionization\nbalance between Fe I and Fe II, and Ca I and Ca II. Accurate abundances for a\ntotal of 40 elements and for 23 neutron-capture elements beyond Sr and up to Th\nwere determined. The heavy element abundance pattern of HE 2327-5642 is in\nexcellent agreement with those previously derived for other strongly r-process\nenhanced stars. Elements in the range from Ba to Hf match the scaled Solar\nr-process pattern very well. No firm conclusion can be drawn with respect to a\nrelationship between the fisrt neutron-capture peak elements, Sr to Pd, in HE\n2327-5642 and the Solar r-process, due to the uncertainty of the latter. A\nclear distinction in Sr/Eu abundance ratios was found between the halo stars\nwith different europium enhancement. The strongly r-process enhanced stars\nreveal a low Sr/Eu abundance ratio at [Sr/Eu] = -0.92+-0.13, while the stars\nwith 0 < [Eu/Fe] < 1 and [Eu/Fe] < 0 have 0.36 dex and 0.93 dex larger Sr/Eu\nvalues, respectively.

This paper studies the temporal behavior of the good seeing sequences.\nAims: An efficient exploitation of extremely good seeing with an adaptive\noptics system needs long integrations. It is then important to explore the\ntemporal distribution of the fraction of time providing excellent seeing.\nMethods: Temporal windows of good seeing are created by a simple binary\nprocess. Good or bad. Their autocorrelations are corrected for those of the\nexisting data sets, since these are not continuous, being often interrupted by\ntechnical problems in addition to the adverse weather gaps. At the end these\ncorrected autocorrelations provide the typical duration of good seeing\nsequences. This study has to be a little detailed as its results depend on the\nseason, summer or winter. Results: Using a threshold of 0.5 arcsec to define\nthe \"good seeing\", three characteristic numbers are found to describe the\ntemporal evolution of the good seeing windows. The first number is the mean\nduration of an uninterrupted good seeing sequence: it is $\\tau_0=7.5$ hours at\n8 m above the ground (15 hours at 20 m).

We use 546 days of continuous\nsky-survey observations obtained with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope to study the gamma-ray emission towards 13 globular\nclusters. Steady point-like high-energy gamma-ray emission has been\nsignificantly detected towards 8 globular clusters. Five of them (47 Tucanae,\nOmega Cen, NGC 6388, Terzan 5, and M 28) show hard spectral power indices $(0.7\n< \\Gamma <1.4)$ and clear evidence for an exponential cut-off in the range\n1.0-2.6 GeV, which is the characteristic signature of magnetospheric emission\nfrom MSPs. Three of them (M 62, NGC 6440 and NGC 6652) also show hard spectral\nindices $(1.0 < \\Gamma < 1.7)$, however the presence of an exponential cut-off\ncan not be unambiguously established. Three of them (Omega Cen, NGC 6388, NGC\n6652) have no known radio or X-ray MSPs yet still exhibit MSP spectral\nproperties. From the observed gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the total\nnumber of MSPs that is expected to be present in these globular clusters. We\nshow that our estimates of the MSP population correlate with the stellar\nencounter rate and we estimate 2600-4700 MSPs in Galactic globular clusters,\ncommensurate with previous estimates. The observation of high-energy gamma-ray\nemission from a globular cluster thus provides a reliable independent method to\nassess their millisecond pulsar populations that can be used to make\nconstraints on the original neutron star X-ray binary population, essential for\nunderstanding the importance of binary systems in slowing the inevitable core\ncollapse of globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 14:30:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 13:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The internal symmetry of the pattern, in\nthe case of the ladder structure, differs slightly from that suggested so far\nfor cuprates. We focus on this OCP and look for measurable signatures of its\nexistence. We compute the magnetic field produced by the OCP at each lattice\nsite, and estimate its value in view of a possible experimental detection.\nUsing a renormalization group (RG) analysis, we determine the changes that are\ncaused by the SU(2) spin-rotational symmetry breaking which occurs when the OCP\nis present in the ground state phase diagram. The most signifcant one is an\nin-plane SDW gap opening in an otherwise critical phase, at intermediate\ndopings. We estimate the value of this gap, give an analytic expression for the\ncorrelation functions and examine some of the magnetic properties of this new\nphase which can be revealed in measurements. We compute the conductance in the\npresence of a single impurity, using an RG analysis. A discussion of the\nvarious sources of SU(2) symmetry breaking underscores the specificity of the\nOCP induced effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 22:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

In addition to\nthis we show that the field theory is inherently non-local in this approach. We\nalso derive the linear field equations and show that they are a generalized\nversion of the time fractional diffusion-wave equation. We show that in the\nNewtonian limit a fractional version of Poisson's equation for gravity arises.\nFinally we conclude open problems such as the relation of the non-locality of\nthis theory to quantum field theories and the possible relation to fractional\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 11:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-26"}

The model of the general three-body problem is used.\nDifferent laws of friction are considered. The topology of the phase space is\nessential in understanding the evolution of the system. The topology is\ndetermined by the families of stable and unstable periodic orbits, both\nsymmetric and non symmetric. It is along the stable families, or close to them,\nthat the planets migrate when dissipative forces act. At the critical points\nwhere the stability along the family changes, there is a bifurcation of a new\nfamily of stable periodic orbits and the migration process changes route and\nfollows the new stable family up to large eccentricities or to a chaotic\nregion. We consider both resonant and non resonant planetary systems. The 2/1,\n3/1 and 3/2 resonances are studied. The migration to larger or smaller\neccentricities depends on the particular law of friction. Also, in some cases\nthe semimajor axes increase and in other cases they are stabilized. For\nparticular laws of friction and for special values of the parameters of the\nfrictional forces, it is possible to have partially stationary solutions, where\nthe eccentricities and the semimajor axes are fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 10:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
