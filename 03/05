The sensitivity with which this\npower spectrum can be estimated depends on the level of thermal noise and\nsample variance, and also on the systematic errors arising from the extraction\nprocess, in particular from the subtraction of foreground contamination. We\nmodel the extraction process using realistic simulations of the cosmological\nsignal, the foregrounds and noise, and so estimate the sensitivity of the LOFAR\nEoR experiment to the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum. Detection of emission\nfrom the EoR should be possible within 360 hours of observation with a single\nstation beam. Integrating for longer, and synthesizing multiple station beams\nwithin the primary (tile) beam, then enables us to extract progressively more\naccurate estimates of the power at a greater range of scales and redshifts.

A plan in which lower\nfrequencies receive a larger fraction of the time appears to be promising. We\nalso study the nature of the bias which foreground fitting errors induce on the\ninferred power spectrum, and discuss how to reduce and correct for this bias.\nThe angular and line-of-sight power spectra have different merits in this\nrespect, and we suggest considering them separately in the analysis of LOFAR\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 19:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-20"}

However, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it is\nuncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the ISCO, and the\nmagnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may contain\nlarge-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity.\nWe describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spin\nparameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the NT model.\nOur fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity)\npoloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order to\nmatch the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane. For a thin disk\nwith an aspect ratio |h/r| ~ 0.07 around a non-spinning black hole, we find a\ndecrease in the accreted specific angular momentum of 2.9% relative to the NT\nmodel and an excess luminosity from inside the ISCO of 3.5%. The deviations in\nthe case of spinning black holes are of the same order. In addition, the\ndeviations decrease with decreasing |h/r|. We therefore conclude that\nmagnetized thin accretion disks in x-ray binaries in the thermal/high-soft\nspectral state ought to be well-described by the NT model, especially at\nluminosities below 30% of Eddington where we expect a very small disk thickness\n|h/r| <~ 0.05.

Large\ncosmological N-body simulations are used to calculate the complete non-linear\nevolution of the peculiar gravitational potential. Tracing light rays back\nthrough the past lightcone of a chosen observer accurately captures the\ntemperature perturbations generated by linear (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe or\nISW effect) and non-linear (the Rees-Sciama or RS effect) evolution. These\neffects give rise to three kinds of non-linear features in the temperature\nmaps. (a) In overdense regions, converging flows of matter induce cold spots of\norder 100 Mpc in extent which can dominate over the ISW effect at high\nredshift, and are surrounded by hot rings.

The continuous escape of gas outside the truncation radius strongly\nsuppresses star formation, while the growth of the SMBH is less affected by gas\nstripping because the SMBH accretion is primarily ruled by the density of the\ncentral region. As we allow for increasing environmental effects - the\ntruncation radius decreasing from about 410 to 50 kpc - we find that the final\nSMBH mass declines from about 10^9 to 8 x 10^8 Msol, but the outflowing mass is\nroughly constant at about 2 x 10^10 Msol.

Although commonly used in a wide range of\nanalytical and numerical studies, the equation of state (EOS) with a constant\nadiabatic index is a poor approximation for relativistic hydrodynamics.\nAdopting a more realistic EOS with a variable adiabatic index, we present a\nsimple form of jump conditions for relativistic hydrodynamical shocks. Then we\ndescribe in detail our technique of modeling a very general class of GRB blast\nwaves with a long-lived reverse shock. Our technique admits an arbitrary radial\nstratification of the ejecta and ambient medium. We use two different methods\nto find dynamics of the blast wave: (1) customary pressure balance across the\nblast wave and (2) the \"mechanical model\".

In\nparticular, this model resolves the conflicting angular position and radial\nvelocity constraints on the Sgr leading tidal stream that have been highlighted\nin recent years. While the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation\nobserved in the leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that\nthis bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the\nSgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the success\nof this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric component to the\nGalactic gravitational potential which can be described in terms of a triaxial\ndark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio (c/a)_Phi = 0.72 and\nintermediate/major axis ratio (b/a)_Phi = 0.99 at radii 20 < r < 60 kpc.

Numerical simulations showed that such turbulence is\nsub-sonic in the first star-forming minihalos, and highly supersonic in the\nfirst galaxies with virial temperatures larger than 10^4 K. We investigate the\nmagnetic field amplification during the collapse both for Kolmogorov and\nBurgers-type turbulence with a semi-analytic model that incorporates the\neffects of gravitational compression and small-scale dynamo amplification. We\nfind that the magnetic field may be substantially amplified before the\nformation of a disk. On scales of 1/10 of the Jeans length, saturation occurs\nafter ~10^8 yr. Although the saturation behaviour of the small-scale dynamo is\nstill somewhat uncertain, we expect a saturation field strength of the order\n~10^{-7} n^{0.5} G in the first star-forming halos, with n the number density\nin cgs units. In the first galaxies with higher turbulent velocities, the\nmagnetic field strength may be increased by an order of magnitude, and\nsaturation may occur after 10^6 to 10^7 yr. In the Kolmogorov case, the\nmagnetic field strength on the integral scale (i.e. the scale with most\nmagnetic power) is higher due to the characteristic power-law indices, but the\ndifference is less than a factor of 2 in the saturated phase. Our results thus\nindicate that the precise scaling of the turbulent velocity with length scale\nis of minor importance.

This superfluidity is the electrically neutral analog of\nsuperconductivity; however, superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases occurs in the\nlimit of strong interactions and defies a conventional BCS description. For\nthese strong interactions, it is predicted that the onset of pairing and\nsuperfluidity can occur at different temperatures.

We\ndemonstrate that our construction agrees with that of [6] and [7] in the case\nwhere both series are defined, and hence inherits the desired analytic\nproperties for n sufficiently large. Moreover our construction is valid even\nfor n=1, where we prove our series is a Whittaker coefficient of an Eisenstein\nseries. This requires the Casselman-Shalika formula for unramified principal\nseries and a remarkable deformation of the Weyl character formula of Hamel and\nKing [20].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 22:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 10:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-23"}

In the DSP model, the\nresource provider provides the service of creating and managing runtime\nenvironments for MTC or HTC service providers, and consolidates heterogeneous\nMTC or HTC workloads on the cloud platform; second, according to the DSP model,\nwe design and implement DawningCloud, which provides automatic management for\nheterogeneous workloads; third, a comprehensive evaluation of DawningCloud has\nbeen performed in an emulatation experiment. We found that for typical\nworkloads, in comparison with the previous two cloud solutions, DawningCloud\nsaves the resource consumption maximally by 46.4% (HTC) and 74.9% (MTC) for the\nservice providers, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 29.7%\nfor the resource provider.

Dynamical mean field equations were\nderived for such networks by taking the average of two stochastic variables: a\nfiring state variable and a synaptic variable. In these equations, their\naverage product is decoupled as the product of averaged them because the two\nstochastic variables are independent. We proved the independence of these two\nstochastic variables assuming that the synaptic weight is of the order of 1/N\nwith respect to the number of neurons N. Using these equations, we derived\nmacroscopic steady state equations for a network with uniform connections and a\nring attractor network with Mexican hat type connectivity and investigated the\nstability of the steady state solutions. An oscillatory uniform state was\nobserved in the network with uniform connections due to a Hopf instability.\nWith the ring network, high-frequency perturbations were shown not to affect\nsystem stability. Two mechanisms destabilize the inhomogeneous steady state,\nleading two oscillatory states. A Turing instability leads to a rotating bump\nstate, while a Hopf instability leads to an oscillatory bump state, which was\nprevious unreported. Various oscillatory states take place in a network with\nsynaptic depression depending on the strength of the interneuron connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 09:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-08"}

With lineage sorting, species tree inference is to find the tree\nminimizing extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages; with\ngene duplication, it becomes to find the tree minimizing gene duplications\nand/or losses.

Some planets\noutside the habitable zone of a host star during the main sequence phase may\nenter the habitable zone of the host star during other evolutionary phases. A\nterrestrial planet within the habitable zone of its host star is generally\nthought to be suited to life existence. Furthermore, a rocky moon around a\ngiant planet may be also suited to life survive, provided that the planet-moon\nsystem is within the habitable zone of its host star. Using Eggleton's code and\nthe boundary flux of habitable zone, we calculate the habitable zone of our\nSolar after the main sequence phase. It is found that Mars' orbit and Jupiter's\norbit will enter the habitable zone of Solar during the subgiant branch phase\nand the red giant branch phase, respectively. And the orbit of Saturn will\nenter the habitable zone of Solar during the He-burning phase for about 137\nmillion years. Life is unlikely at any time on Saturn, as it is a giant gaseous\nplanet. However, Titan, the rocky moon of Saturn, may be suitable for\nbiological evolution and become another Earth during that time.

For IGR\nJ12123-5802 we find a likely counterpart, but further information are needed to\nclassified this object, IGR J1248.2-5828 is found to be a Seyfert 1.9, for IGR\nJ13107-5626 we suggest a possible AGN nature, while IGR J14080-3023 is\nclassified as a Seyfert 1.5 galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 09:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-08"}

Beyond perturbation regime it exhibits a broad\nmaximum versus the driving field strength.

The equation of state at present is somewhat\nweakly constrained to $w_0 \\leq -0.6$, if we allow $H_0 < 60$ km/s/Mpc.

The gauge, Higgs and the\nthird generation matter multiplets are placed in the bulk. From a 4d\nperspective, the bulk has N=2 supersymmetry which entails a special\nnon-renormalization theorem giving rise to a significant numerical impact on\nthe renormalization group running of various parameters. The brane\nsupersymmetry corresponds to N=1 which we assume to be broken in an unspecified\nbut phenomenologically acceptable way. Given this set-up, we study how the\ngauge and Yukawa couplings and the N=1 brane supersymmetry breaking soft masses\nrun through the energy scale exciting the Kaluza-Klein states at regular\ninterval. We present our results by showing the allowed/disallowed zone in the\nplane of the common scalar mass ($m_0$) and common gaugino mass ($M_{1/2}$).\nOur plots are the first 5d versions of the often displayed 4d $m_0$--$M_{1/2}$\nplots, and we provide reasons behind the differences between the 4d and 5d\nplots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 14:28:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 14:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}

After a brief summary on significant advances in\ncharacterizing various types of discrete X-ray sources, the presentation\nfocuses on the global hot gas in and around galaxies, especially normal ones\nlike our own. The hot gas is a product of stellar and AGN feedback -- the least\nunderstood part in theories of galaxy formation and evolution. Chandra\nobservations have led to the first characterization of the spatial, thermal,\nchemical, and kinetic properties of the gas in our Galaxy. The gas is\nconcentrated around the Galactic bulge and disk on scales of a few kpc. The\ncolumn density of chemically-enriched hot gas on larger scales is at least an\norder magnitude smaller, indicating that it may not account for the bulk of the\nmissing baryon matter predicted for the Galactic halo according to the standard\ncosmology. Similar results have also been obtained for other nearby galaxies.\nThe X-ray emission from hot gas is well correlated with the star formation rate\nand stellar mass, indicating that the heating is primarily due to the stellar\nfeedback. However, the observed X-ray luminosity of the gas is typically less\nthan a few percent of the feedback energy. Thus the bulk of the feedback\n(including injected heavy elements) is likely lost in galaxy-wide outflows. The\nresults are compared with simulations of the feedback to infer its dynamics and\ninterplay with the circum-galactic medium, hence the evolution of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 14:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It allows to exploit properties of dependent rounding, and\nprovides a quite tight analysis resulting in the improved approximation ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 15:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In the case of abelian vortices in\ngauged linear sigma-models, this allows us to compute explicitly the Kaehler\nclass of the L^2-metric. As an application we compute the total volume of the\nmoduli space of abelian semi-local vortices. In the strong coupling limit, this\nthen leads to conjectural formulae for the volume of the space of holomorphic\nmaps from a compact Riemann surface to projective space. Finally we show that\nthe localization results of Samols in the abelian Higgs model extend to more\ngeneral models. These include linear non-abelian vortices and vortices in\ngauged toric sigma-models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2010 15:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 15:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 13:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}
