The model predicts 8 particles and\npredicts the ratio of their masses. I.e., the vertices of the 8-dimensional\nGosset polytope identifies with the 240 roots of $E_8$. Under the 2-D (Peter\nMcMullen) projection of the polytope, the image of the vertices are arranged in\n8 concentric circles, here referred to as the Gosset circles. The Gosset\ncircles are understood to correspond to the 8 masses in the model, and it is\nunderstood that the ratio of their radii is the same as the ratio of the\ncorres-ponding conjectural masses. A ratio of the two smallest circles (read 2\nsmallest masses) is the golden number. The conjectures have been now validated\nexperimentally, at least for the first five masses. The McMullen projection\ngeneralizes to any complex simple Lie algebra whose rank is greater than 1. The\nGosset circles also generalize, using orbits of the Coxeter element. Using\nresults in a 1959 paper of mine, I found some time ago a very easily defined\noperator $A$ whose spectrum is exactly the squares of the radii $r_i$ of these\ngeneralized Gosset circles. As a confirmation, in the $E_8$ case, using only\nthe eigenvalues of a suitable multiple of $A$, Vogan computed the ratio of the\n$r_i$. Happily these agree with the corresponding ratio of the Zamolodchikov\nmasses. The operator $A$ is written as a sum of $\\ell +1$ rank 1 operators,\nparameterized by the points in the extended Dynkin diagram. Involved in this\nexpansion are the coefficients $n_i$ of the highest root. Recalling the McKay\ncorrespondence, in the $E_8$ case, the $n_i$, together with 1, are the\ndimensions of the irreducible representations of the binary icosahedral group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 01:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-02"}

Here we address this issue, as well as the\ngeneral problem of comparing statistics from distinct eras, by detrending the\nseasonal statistics of professional baseball players. We detrend player\nstatistics by normalizing achievements to seasonal averages, which accounts for\nchanges in relative player ability resulting from both exogenous and endogenous\nfactors, such as talent dilution from expansion, equipment and training\nimprovements, as well as performance enhancing drugs (PED). In this paper we\ncompare the probability density function (pdf) of detrended career statistics\nto the pdf of raw career statistics for five statistical categories -- hits\n(H), home runs (HR), runs batted in (RBI), wins (W) and strikeouts (K) -- over\nthe 90-year period 1920-2009. We find that the functional form of these pdfs\nare stationary under detrending. This stationarity implies that the statistical\nregularity observed in the right-skewed distributions for longevity and success\nin professional baseball arises from both the wide range of intrinsic talent\namong athletes and the underlying nature of competition. Using this simple\ndetrending technique, we examine the top 50 all-time careers for H, HR, RBI, W\nand K. We fit the pdfs for career success by the Gamma distribution in order to\ncalculate objective benchmarks based on extreme statistics which can be used\nfor the identification of extraordinary careers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 16:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 00:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-17"}

Most prior work considers situations in which\nthe activation/non-activation of each node is statistically independent, but\nthis is unrealistic in many problems.

First, we propose a sparsifying transform that\nsuccinctly represents structured activation patterns that conform to a\nhierarchical dependency graph. Second, we establish that the proposed transform\nfacilitates detection of very weak activation patterns that cannot be detected\nwith existing methods.

In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to\nmodify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take\ninto account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say\nthat in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition\nand that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and\ncontemporary research systems. In this paper we present a preliminary\nexploration aimed at understanding how speech data depart from HMMs and what\neffect this departure has on the accuracy of HMM-based speech recognition. Our\nanalysis uses standard diagnostic tools from the field of statistics --\nhypothesis testing, simulation and resampling -- which are rarely used in the\nfield of speech recognition. Our main result, obtained by novel manipulations\nof real and resampled data, demonstrates that real data have statistical\ndependency and that this dependency is responsible for significant numbers of\nrecognition errors. We also demonstrate, using simulation and resampling, that\nif we `remove' the statistical dependency from data, then the resulting\nrecognition error rates become negligible. Taken together, these results\nsuggest that a better understanding of the structure of the statistical\ndependency in speech data is a crucial first step towards improving HMM-based\nspeech recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 19:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-02"}

We observe the absence of dynamic\nscaling and reveal fundamentally different classes of length scales: The first\nclass comprises the mean ice thickness and the (inverse) specific surface area\n(measured per ice volume) which increase monotonically and follow a power law.\nThe dynamic exponent is in accordance with coarsening of a locally conserved\norder parameter. A second class of length scales is derived from the slopes of\n$C(\\mathbf{r},t)$ at the origin in different coordinate directions.

In this paper, the D-MG\ntradeoff of multi-antenna systems with PAPR constraints is analyzed. For\nRayleigh fading channels, we show that the D-MG tradeoff remains unchanged with\nany PAPR constraints larger than one. This result implies that, instead of\ndesigning codes on a case-by-case basis, as done by most existing works, there\npossibly exist general methodologies for designing space-time codes with low\nPAPR that achieve the optimal D-MG tradeoff. As an example of such\nmethodologies, we propose a PAPR reduction method based on constellation\nshaping that can be applied to existing optimal space-time codes without\naffecting their optimality in the D-MG tradeoff. Unlike most PAPR reduction\nmethods, the proposed method does not introduce redundancy or require side\ninformation being transmitted to the decoder. Two realizations of the proposed\nmethod are considered. The first is similar to the method proposed by Kwok\nexcept that we employ the Hermite Normal Form (HNF) decomposition instead of\nthe Smith Normal Form (SNF) to reduce complexity. The second takes the idea of\ninteger reversible mapping which avoids the difficulty in matrix decomposition\nwhen the number of antennas becomes large.

The main flaw in the analysis that\nled to this claim is inappropriate linearization of an intrinsically nonlinear\nmodel; there is no room for physical interpretations or policy conclusions\nbased on this mathematical error. Sensitive dependence nonetheless does exist\nin the climate system, as well as in climate models -- albeit in a very\ndifferent sense from the one claimed in the linear work under scrutiny -- and\nwe illustrate it using a classical energy balance model (EBM) with nonlinear\nfeedbacks.

The celestial coordinates and fluxes of the events are determined\nstatisti cally and the reliability of their detections is secured through\nmultiple detect ions of the same source within milli-seconds, hours, and months\nfrom each other. Results : The sky coverage is more than 90% for both bands.

A\nset of direct N-body simulations of GCs, with and without an IMBH of mass 1% of\nthe total cluster mass, comprising different initial mass functions (IMFs) and\nprimordial binary fractions, was used to predict the observed mass segregation\nprofile and mass function. The mass segregation profile of M 10 is not\ncompatible with cluster models without either an IMBH or primordial binaries,\nas a source of energy appears to be moderately quenching mass segregation in\nthe cluster. Unfortunately, the present observational uncertainty on the binary\nfraction in M10 does not allow us to confirm the presence of an IMBH in the\ncluster, since an IMBH, a dynamically non-negligible binary fraction (~ 5%), or\nboth can equally well explain the radial dependence of the cluster mass\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 08:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This indicates that ULXs are similar to Galactic BHBs.

Answer:\nYes, at least this can be done with gravitational collapse. (3) How can we\nprove that what we call astrophysical black holes are really black holes?\nAnswer: Finding direct evidence of event horizon is not the way to go. Instead\nI propose five criteria which meet the highest standard for recognizing new\ndiscoveries in experimental physics and observational astronomy. (4) Do we have\nsufficient evidence to claim the existence of astrophysical black holes in the\nphysical universe? Answer: Yes, astrophysical black holes have been found at\nleast in some galactic binary systems, at the center of almost every galaxy,\nand as the central engines of at least some long gamma-ray bursts. (5) Will all\nmatter in the universe eventually fall into black holes? Answer: Probably \"no\",\nbecause \"naked\" compact objects, if they do exist with radii smaller than the\nradii of event horizons for their masses but are not enclosed by event\nhorizons, can rescue the universe from an eternal death by re-cycling out the\nmatter previously accreted into astrophysical black holes.

In addition, the\nresulting quasiparticle band gap is compared to experimental gaps. In the GLLB\nmodel potential, the exchange-correlation hole is modeled using a GGA energy\ndensity and the response of the hole to density variations is evaluated by\nusing the common-denominator approximation and homogeneous electron gas based\nassumptions. In our modification, we have chosen the PBEsol potential as the\nGGA to model the exchange hole, and add a consistent correlation potential. The\nmethod is implemented in the GPAW code, which allows efficient parallelization\nto study large systems. A fair agreement for Kohn-Sham and the quasiparticle\nband gaps with semiconductors and other band gap materials is obtained with a\npotential which is as fast as GGA to calculate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 10:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2010 15:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 13:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The\nsingularity of the bare and screened interaction potentials gives rise to a\nnumerically important self-energy contribution, which we treat analytically to\nachieve good convergence with respect to the k-point sampling. As numerical\nrealizations of the GW approximation typically suffer from the high\ncomputational expense required for the evaluation of the nonlocal and\nfrequency-dependent self-energy, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be made\nvery efficient by exploiting spatial and time-reversal symmetry as well as by\napplying an optimization of the mixed product basis that retains only the\nnumerically important contributions of the electron-electron interaction.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that one can employ an extrapolar approximation for\nhigh-lying states to reduce the number of empty states that must be taken into\naccount explicitly in the construction of the polarization function and the\nself-energy. We show convergence tests, CPU timings, and results for prototype\nsemiconductors and insulators as well as ferromagnetic nickel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 11:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 09:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-15"}

Correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scattering\nare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. The energy spectra in\nthe 2-120 keV band in both states are all dominated by strong Comptonization of\ndisk photons by an optically thick (\\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (T_e ~2-3\nkeV) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% of\nthe total power input. Absorption lines of highly ionized Fe ions detected\nduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. The\nionization stage of the wind correlates with the X-ray flux, supporting the\nphotoionization origin. The iron-K emission line shows a strong variability\nduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip but\ndisappears during the flare. We interpret this as evidence for \"self-shielding\"\nthat the Comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase,\npreventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. The low-temperature and\nhigh luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar to\nthat in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. The spectral\nvariability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the disk\ngeometry and of the physical parameters of Comptonizing corona, particularly\nthe fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 11:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The simulated magnetic\nfield inside the clusters is a result of turbulent amplification within them,\nwith the magnetic seed originating from star-burst driven, galactic outflows.\nWe evaluate three models, where we choose different normalizations for the\nCosmic Ray proton population within clusters. Similar to our previous analysis\nof the Coma cluster (Donnert et al. 2010), the radial profile and the\nmorphological properties of observed radio halos can not be reproduced, even\nwith a radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray proton\npopulation. Scaling relations between X-ray luminosity and radio power can be\nreproduced by all models, however all models fail in the prediction of clusters\nwith no radio emission. Also the evolutionary tracks of our largest clusters in\nall models fail to reproduce the observed bi-modality in radio luminosity. This\nprovides additional evidence that the framework of hadronic, secondary models\nis disfavored to reproduce the large scale diffuse radio emission of galaxy\nclusters. We also provide predictions for the unavoidable emission of\n$\\gamma$-rays from the hadronic models for the full cluster set. None of such\nsecondary models is yet excluded by the observed limits in $\\gamma$-ray\nemission, emphasizing that large scale diffuse radio emission is a powerful\ntool to constrain the amount of cosmic ray protons in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 13:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In addition, the transit timing variations of the exoplanets closest\nto their host stars can provide tests of tidal dissipation theory. These\nstudies, however, have not considered the effect of the host star. There is a\nlarge body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can\nvary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars\ndriven by stellar activity. In this paper we investigate and estimate the\nlikely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets. We find\nin several cases that such variations should be detectable. In particular, the\nestimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected\nfor tidal dissipation, even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation\nparameter. The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are\nalso of the correct magnitude and occur on timescales such that they may be\nconfused with variations caused by light-time travel effects due to the\npresence of a Jupiter-like second planet. Finally, we suggest that transiting\nexoplanet systems may provide a clean route (compared to binaries) to\nconstraining the type of dynamo operating in the host star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 13:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Methods: The\nyoungest detached shells, those around the carbon stars R Scl and U Cam, are\nstudied here in great detail in scattered stellar light with the Advanced\nSurvey Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. Quantitative results are derived\nassuming optically thin dust scattering. Results: The detached dust shells\naround R Scl and U Cam are found to be consistent with an overall spherical\nsymmetry. They have radii of 19.2\" (corresponding to a linear size of 8x10^16\ncm) and 7.7\" (5x10^16 cm), widths of 1.2\" (5x10^15 cm) and 0.6\" (4x10^15 cm),\nand dust masses of 3x10^-6 and 3x10^-7 M(Sun), respectively. The dynamical ages\nof the R Scl and U Cam shells are estimated to be 1700 and 700 yr,\nrespectively, and the shell widths correspond to time scales of 100 and 50 yr,\nrespectively. Small-scale structure in the form of less than arcsec-sized\nclumps is clearly seen in the images of the R Scl shell. Average clump dust\nmasses are estimated to be about 2x10^-9 M(Sun). Comparisons with CO line\ninterferometer data show that the dust and gas shells coincide spatially,\nwithin the errors (<=1\" for U Cam and approx. 2\" for R Scl). Conclusions: The\nresults are consistent with the interpretation of geometrically thin gas and\ndust shells formed by a mass-loss eruption during a He-shell flash, and where\ninteraction with a previous wind plays a role as well. Clumpy structure is\npresent in the R Scl shell, possibly as a consequence of the mass loss itself,\nbut more likely as a consequence of instabilities in the expanding shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 14:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Likewise, variation of\nthe density with a fixed bandgap results in a transition from the FQHE states\nat lower Landau levels to compressible states at intermediate Landau levels and\nfinally to FQHE states at higher Landau levels. This intriguing scenario of\ntunable phase transitions in the fractional quantum Hall states is unique to\nbilayer graphene and never before existed in conventional semiconductor\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 15:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-02"}

While some non-uniform\ncontrast appears near the edge of the cleaved crystal, the scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) reveals mostly uniform contrast. For the regions that showed\nuniform SEM contrast, a sharp superconducting transition at TC = 22.1 K has\nbeen observed with a transition width (delta)Tc = 0.2 K. In the non-uniform\ncontrast region, TC is found to vary between 19.6 and 22.2 K with (delta)Tc\nfrom 0.3 to 3.2 K. The wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy reveals that Co\nconcentration remains 7.72% in the uniform region, but changes between 7.38%\nand 7.62% in the non-uniform region. Thus the variations of superconductivity\nare associated with local compositional change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2010 15:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-02"}
