There are two major options in this kind of parametrizations, one is the\noriginal Kobayashi-Maskawa (KM) matrix, and the other is the Chau-Keung (CK)\nmatrix. In a new proposal by Frampton and He, a unitarity boomerang is\nintroduced to combine two unitarity triangles, and this new presentation\ndisplays all four independent parameters of the KM parametrization in the quark\nsector simultaneously. In this paper, we study the relations between KM and CK\nparametrizations, and also consider the quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) in\nthe KM parametrization. The unitarity boomerang is discussed in the situation\nof the CK parametrization for comparison with that in the KM parametrization in\nthe quark sector. Then we extend the idea of unitarity boomerang to the lepton\nsector, and check the corresponding unitarity boomerangs in the two cases of\nparametrizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 16:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 06:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The instability was observed in\ndifferent facilities in infrared and visible wavelength ranges. In this paper\nwe propose to use such an instability for generation of VUV and X-ray\nradiation. A typical longitudinal space charge amplifier (LSCA) consists of few\namplification cascades (drift space plus chicane) with a short undulator behind\nthe last cascade. If the amplifier starts up from the shot noise, the amplified\ndensity modulation has a wide band, on the order of unity. The bandwidth of the\nradiation within the central cone is given by inverse number of undulator\nperiods. A wavelength compression could be an attractive option for LSCA since\nthe process is broadband, and a high compression stability is not required.\nLSCA can be used as a cheap addition to the existing or planned\nshort-wavelength FELs. In particular, it can produce the second color for a\npump-probe experiment. It is also possible to generate attosecond pulses in the\nVUV and X-ray regimes. Some user experiments can profit from a relatively large\nbandwidth of the radiation, and this is easy to obtain in LSCA scheme.

In the\nfirst case, we say an algorithm for dynamically maintaining a eps-kernel is\nstable if at most O(1) points change in K as one point is inserted or deleted\nfrom P. We describe an algorithm to maintain an eps-kernel of size\nO(1/eps^{(d-1)/2}) in O(1/eps^{(d-1)/2} + log n) time per update. Not only does\nour algorithm maintain a stable eps-kernel, its update time is faster than any\nknown algorithm that maintains an eps-kernel of size O(1/eps^{(d-1)/2}). Next,\nwe show that if there is an eps-kernel of P of size k, which may be\ndramatically less than O(1/eps^{(d-1)/2}), then there is an (eps/2)-kernel of P\nof size O(min {1/eps^{(d-1)/2}, k^{floor(d/2)} log^{d-2} (1/eps)}). Moreover,\nthere exists a point set P in |R^d and a parameter eps > 0 such that if every\neps-kernel of P has size at least k, then any (eps/2)-kernel of P has size\nOmega(k^{floor(d/2)}).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 17:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-31"}

The event rate depends on the dark matter density in the sun, which in\nturn is dictated by the cross section of WIMPs with nucleons. This however is\nbounded by direct detection experiments. We use the constraints from these\nexperiments to place model-independent upper bounds on the event rates in\nneutrino telescopes that apply to any elastic dark matter model. Since the\nspin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section is much more tightly constrained\nthan the corresponding spin-dependent cross section, the bounds are much\nstronger in the former case and are competitive with the current limits from\nIceCube. If the number of events observed in neutrino telescopes exceeds the\nupper bound corresponding to spin-independent interactions, the implication is\nthat the cross section of dark matter with nucleons is dominated by\nspin-dependent interactions. In such a scenario the natural dark matter\ncandidates are Majorana fermions and real vector bosons, so that dark matter\nparticles are their own anti-particles.

This has lead to the intriguing suggestion\nthat this high energy emission is generated via synchrotron emission of\nrelativistic electrons accelerated by the external shock. Moreover, the limits\non the MeV afterglow emission lead to the suggestion that, at least in bright\nGeV bursts the field is not amplified beyond compression in the shock. We show\nhere that considerations of confinement (within the decelerating shock),\nefficiency and cooling of the emitting electrons constrain, within this model,\nthe magnetic fields that arise in both the upstream (circum burst) and\ndownstream (ejecta) regions, allowing us to obtain a direct handle on their\nvalues. The well known limit on the maximal synchrotron emission, when combined\nwith the blast wave evolution, implies that late photons (arriving more than\n~100 s after the burst) with energies higher than ~ 10GeV do not arise\nnaturally from external shock synchrotron and almost certainly have a different\norigin. Finally, even a modest seed flux (a few mJy) at IR-optical would\nquench, via Inverse Compton cooling, the GeV emission unless the magnetic field\nis significantly amplified behind the shock.

As early as 1967, in a pioneering work, V. Braginsky analyzed\ntheoretically the role of radiation pressure in the interferometric measurement\nprocess, but it has remained experimentally unexplored for many decades. Here,\nwe use whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical microresonators to study these\nradiation pressure phenomena. Optical microresonators simultaneously host\noptical and mechanical modes, which are systematically analyzed and optimized\nto feature ultra-low mechanical dissipation, photon storage times exceeding the\nmechanical oscillation period (i.e. the \"resolved-sideband regime\") and large\noptomechanical coupling. It is demonstrated that dynamical backaction can be\nemployed to cool mechanical modes, i.e., to reduce their thermally excited\nrandom motion. Utilizing this novel technique together with cryogenic\npre-cooling of the mechanical oscillator, the phonon occupation of mechanical\nradial-breathing modes could be reduced to about 60 excitation quanta. The\ncorresponding displacement fluctuations are monitored interferometrically with\na sensitivity at the level of 10^-18 m/Hz^(1/2), which is below the imprecision\nat the standard quantum limit (SQL).

In a traditional linear receiver architecture, the\nreceive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit\nantenna, which can then be decoded individually. Although easy to implement,\nthis approach can be highly suboptimal when the channel matrix is near\nsingular. This paper develops a new linear receiver architecture that uses the\nreceive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer-valued\nentries. Rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords directly, the\ndecoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries\nof the effective channel matrix. The codewords are all generated using the same\nlinear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves\ncodewords. Provided that the effective channel is full rank, these integer\ncombinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords. This\npaper focuses on the special case where there is no coding across transmit\nantennas and no channel state information at the transmitter(s), which\ncorresponds either to a multi-user uplink scenario or to single-user V-BLAST\nencoding. In this setting, the proposed integer-forcing linear receiver\nsignificantly outperforms conventional linear architectures such as the\nzero-forcing and linear MMSE receiver. In the high SNR regime, the proposed\nreceiver attains the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the standard\nMIMO channel with no coding across transmit antennas. It is further shown that\nin an extended MIMO model with interference, the integer-forcing linear\nreceiver achieves the optimal generalized degrees-of-freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 03:57:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 21:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 04:41:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 16:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

We propose that in solid\n$^4$He the stiffening of the shear modulus with decreasing temperature can be\ndescribed with a glass susceptibility assuming a temperature dependent\nrelaxation time $\\tau(T)$. The glass susceptibility captures the freezing out\nof glassy degrees of freedom below a characteristic crossover temperature\n$T_X$. There the dynamic response of the solid satisfies $\\omega \\tau(T_X) \\sim\n1$, thus leading to an increase in the shear modulus. Within this model we\npredict that the maximum change of the amplitude of the shear modulus and the\nheight of the dissipation peak are independent of the applied frequency\n$\\omega$. Our calculations also show a qualitative difference in behavior of\nthe shear modulus depending on the temperature behavior of the glass relaxation\ntime $\\tau(T)$.

As the parameter $\\beta$\nincreases, the values of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility increase to\npositive infinity or decrease to negative infinity at the exotic point\n$\\beta_{c}=1$.

The techniques considered are those that modify signals from\nauxiliary reference antennas to model and cancel interference from an\nastronomical observation. These techniques can be applied in the time domain,\nwhere the RFI voltage is modeled and subtracted from the astronomy signal path\n(adaptive noise canceling), or they can be applied to the autocorrelated and\ncross-correlated voltage spectra in the frequency domain (postcorrelation\ncanceling). For ideal receivers and a single, statistically stationary\ninterfering signal, both precorrelation and postcorrelation filters can result\nin complete cancellation of the interference from the observation. The\npostcorrelation method has the advantage of being applied on tens or hundreds\nof millisecond timescales rather than tens or hundreds of nanosecond\ntimescales. However, this can be a disadvantage if the RFI transmitter location\nis changing, since the cross-correlated power measurements which link the\ninterference power in the astronomy and reference signal paths can decorrelate.\nIf the decorrelation is not too severe, it can be allowed for, at the expense\nof a noise increase. The time domain adaptive cancelers are allowed to slightly\nvary their internal coefficients and adapt to changing phases during the\nintegrations, which means that they avoid the decorrelation problem. However,\nthe freedom to adapt also results in a noise increase. In this paper the\nability of both types of cancelers to excise interference originating from a\nmoving source is compared. The cancelers perform well on both observed and\nsimulated data, giving complete cancellation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 09:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-01"}

The star is differentially rotating, with latitudinal\nangular velocity shear of domega = 0.146 +- 0.049 rad/d, corresponding to\nequatorial and polar periods of 11.94 +- 0.16 d and 16.53 +- 2.43 d\nrespectively. The study of the stellar activity shows that it is modulated\nmainly by the stellar rotation (rather than by the orbital period or the beat\nperiod between the stellar rotation and the orbital periods). We report no\nclear evidence of magnetospheric interactions between the star and the planet.\n  We also extrapolated the field in the stellar corona and calculated the\nplanetary radio emission expected for HD 189733b given the reconstructed field\ntopology. The radio flux we predict in the framework of this model is time\nvariable and potentially detectable with LOFAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 11:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is\noperating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that\nregion for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce\nthe power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing\ntechnique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS\napproach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high\ncurrent drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS\nis based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which\nvaries with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate\nand substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for\nPMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and\npower dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as\nthose of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves\nthe power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold\nregion.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is\nmade and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay\nproduct are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over\nconventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool. The dependency of these\nparameters on frequency of operation has also been investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 12:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

Global MHD simulations show Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities at\nthe contact surface of two merging neutron stars. That region has been\nidentified as the site of efficient amplification of magnetic fields. However,\nthese global simulations, due to numerical limitations, were unable to\ndetermine the saturation level of the field strength, and thus the possible\nback-reaction of the magnetic field onto the flow. Aims. We investigate the\namplification of initially weak fields in KH unstable shear flows, and the\nback-reaction of the field onto the flow. Methods. We use a high-resolution\nideal MHD code to perform 2D and 3D local simulations of shear flows. Results.\nIn 2D, the magnetic field is amplified in less than 0.01ms until it reaches\nlocally equipartition with the kinetic energy. Subsequently, it saturates due\nto resistive instabilities that disrupt the KH vortex and decelerate the shear\nflow on a secular time scale. We determine scaling laws of the field\namplification with the initial field strength and the grid resolution. In 3D,\nthis hydromagnetic mechanism may be dominated by purely hydrodynamic\ninstabilities limiting the amplification. We find maximum magnetic fields of\n10^16 G locally, and r.m.s. maxima within the box of 10^15 G. However, such\nstrong fields exist only for a short period. In the saturated state, the\nmagnetic field is mainly oriented parallel to the shear flow for strong initial\nfields, while weaker initial fields tend to lead to a more balanced\ndistribution of the field energy. In all models the flow shows small-scale\nfeatures. The magnetic field is at most in equipartition with the decaying\nshear flow.

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets.

Two types of striped diagonal long-range order (striped\norder I and striped order II) are discussed. A state with type-II striped order\nand superfluidity is found, even without nearest-neighbor repulsion. The\nemergence of such a state is due to the inhomogeneity and the anisotropy of the\nlattice structure. However, neither the translational symmetry nor the symmetry\nbetween sublattices of the original lattice is broken. In this paper, we\nrestrict a 'solid state' of lattice bosons as a diagonal long-range ordered\nstate breaking either the translational symmetry of the original lattice or the\nsymmetry of different sublattices. We thus name such a phase a striped\nsuperfluid phase (SSF). In the presence of a nearest-neighbor repulsion, we\nfind two striped charge density wave phases(SCDW I and II) with boson density\n$\\rho=1/2$ (with striped order I) and $\\rho=2/3$ (with striped order II)\nrespectively, when the hopping amplitude is small compared with the repulsion.\nThe SCDW I state is a solid, in which the translational symmetry of the\noriginal lattice is broken. We observe a rather special first-order phase\ntransition showing an interesting multi-loop hysteresis phenomenon between the\ntwo SCDW phases when the hopping term is small enough. This can be accounted\nfor by the special degeneracy of the ground states near the classical limit.\nThe SSF re-appears outside the two SCDW phases. The transition between the SCDW\nI and SSF phases is first order, while the transition between SCDW II and SSF\nphases is continuous. We find that the superfluid stiffness is anisotropic in\nthe SSF states with and without repulsion. In the SSF with repulsion, the\nsuperfluid stiffness is subject to different types of anisotropy in the region\nnear half filling and above 2/3-filling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:56:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 12:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We find that in nearly\nall cases at least some of them are massless. However, we identify a large\nsubclass where the fractional charges are at worst half-integer, and often\nvector-like. The number of families is very often reduced in comparison to the\n1989 results, but there are no new tensor combinations yielding three families.\nAll tensor combinations turn out to fall into two classes: those where the\nnumber of families is always divisible by three, and those where it is never\ndivisible by three. We find an empirical rule to determine the class, which\nappears to extend beyond minimal N=2 tensor products. We observe that\ndistributions of physical quantities such as the number of families, singlets\nand mirrors have an interesting tendency towards smaller values as the gauge\ngroups approaches the Standard Model.

As an\nevolutionary boundary of image of the transformation, a random curve (the SLE\ncurve) is generated, which is starting from the origin and running in $\\H$\ntoward the infinity as time is going. The SLE curves provides a variety of\nstatistical ensembles of important fractal curves, if we change the diffusion\nconstant of the driving BM. In the present paper, we consider the\nSchwarz-Christoffel transformation (SCT), which is a conformal map from $\\H$ to\nthe region $\\H$ with a slit starting from the origin. We prepare a binomial\nsystem of SCTs, one of which generates a slit in $\\H$ with an angle $\\alpha\n\\pi$ from the positive direction of the real axis, and the other of which with\nan angle $(1-\\alpha) \\pi$. One parameter $\\kappa >0$ is introduced to control\nthe value of $\\alpha$ and the length of slit. Driven by a one-dimensional\nrandom walk, which is a binomial stochastic process, a random iteration of SCTs\nis performed. By interpolating tips of slits by straight lines, we have a\nrandom path in $\\H$, which we call an Iterative SCT (ISCT) path. It is\nwell-known that, as the number of steps $N$ of random walk goes infinity, each\npath of random walk divided by $\\sqrt{N}$ converges to a Brownian curve. Then\nwe expect that the ISCT paths divided by $\\sqrt{N}$ (the rescaled ISCT paths)\nconverge to the SLE curves in $N \\to \\infty$. Our numerical study implies that,\nfor sufficiently large $N$, the rescaled ISCT paths will have the same\nstatistical properties as the SLE curves have, supporting our expectation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 05:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
