We have reexamined the SIMBAD database for\nadditional stellar candidates (from highest ratios of squared parallax to total\nproper motion) and compared them with new HIP2 parallaxes and known radial\nvelocities. At the moment, the best nominee is double star HD 107914 in the\nconstellation Centaurus at $\\approx$ 78.3 pc from the Sun whose principal\ncomponent is a white (A-type) giant. It does not seem to appear neither in\ngeneral catalogues of radial velocities available at SIMBAD nor in\nauthoritative Garcia-Sanchez et al. papers on stellar encounters with the solar\nsystem. Awaiting for the value $v_r$ of its radial velocity, uknown to the\nauthor, we have calculated limits of $|v_r|$ necessary to this star to pass\nwithin 1 ly and 1 pc from the Sun in linear approximation. A very accurate\nvalue of its total proper motion is also extremely important. In the case of\n$v_r=-100$ km/s and most \"advantageous\" HIP2 data, HD 107914 could pass as near\nas 8380 AU from the Sun in an almost direct collision course with the inner\npart of the solar system! Inversely, if $v_r$ had a great positive value, then\nHIP 60503 could be the creator of peculiar trajectories of detached\ntrans-Neptunian objects like Sedna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2010 16:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-30"}

In\nthis DRFA space, the object of noncommutativity ($\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$) is a\nvariable of the NC system and has a canonical conjugate momentum. The DFRA\nformalism is constructed in an extended space-time with independent degrees of\nfreedom associated with the object of noncommutativity $\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$. A\nconsistent algebra involving the enlarged set of canonical operators is\ndescribed, which permits one to construct theories that are dynamically\ninvariant under the action of the rotation group. A consistent classical\nmechanics formulation is analyzed in such a way that, under quantization, it\nfurnishes a NC quantum theory with interesting results. The Dirac formalism for\nconstrained Hamiltonian systems is considered and the object of\nnoncommutativity $\\theta^{ij}$ plays a fundamental role as an independent\nquantity. It is also explained about the generalized Dirac equation issue, that\nthe fermionic field depends not only on the ordinary coordinates but on\n$\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ as well.

Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web\ntraffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models. We examine both\naggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link\ntraffic, and individual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model\ncurrently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show\nthat all of these traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model\nthat takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents\nmaintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that\nare used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited\nlinks, a branching mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such as\nthe use of a back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by\nvisiting novel pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being more\ntopically related to each other than distant ones. This modulates the\nprobability that an agent continues to browse or starts a new session, allowing\nus to recreate heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model is capable of\nreproducing the collective and individual behaviors we observe in the empirical\ndata, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users\nwith the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements. This result\nallows us to identify a few salient features that are necessary and sufficient\nto interpret the browsing patterns observed in our data. In addition to the\ndescriptive and explanatory power of such a model, our results may lead the way\nto more sophisticated, realistic, and effective ranking and crawling\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2010 22:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-24"}

This\nlow entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly rising\nrelativistic plasma, forming long \"arms\". These arms are likely oriented within\n15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. The mass of the uplifted gas in the arms is\ncomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpc\ncore, demonstrating that the AGN has a profound effect on its immediate\nsurroundings. The coolest X-ray emitting gas in M87 has a temperature of ~0.5\nkeV and is spatially coincident with Halpha+NII nebulae, forming a multiphase\nmedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments.

Previous research on discourse segmentation\nhave relied on the assumption that elementary discourse units (EDUs) in a\ndocument always form a linear sequence (i.e., they can never be nested).\nUnfortunately, this assumption turns out to be too strong, for some theories of\ndiscourse like SDRT allows for nested discourse units. In this paper, we\npresent a simple approach to discourse segmentation that is able to produce\nnested EDUs. Our approach builds on standard multi-class classification\ntechniques combined with a simple repairing heuristic that enforces global\ncoherence. Our system was developed and evaluated on the first round of\nannotations provided by the French Annodis project (an ongoing effort to create\na discourse bank for French).
