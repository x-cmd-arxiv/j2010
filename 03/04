In this paper, we theoretically analyze\nthe morphological stability of a graphene monolayer on an oxide substrate,\nsubject to van der Waals interactions and in-plane mismatch strains. First, we\ndefine the equilibrium separation and the interfacial adhesion energy as the\ntwo key parameters that characterize the van der Waals interaction between a\nflat monolayer and a flat substrate surface. By a perturbation analysis, a\ncritical compressive mismatch strain is predicted, beyond which the graphene\nmonolayer undergoes strain-induced instability, forming corrugations with\nincreasing amplitude and decreasing wavelength on a perfectly flat surface.\nWhen the substrate surface is not perfectly flat, the morphology of graphene\ndepends on both the amplitude and the wavelength of the surface corrugation. A\ntransition from conformal (corrugated) to non-conformal (flat) morphology is\npredicted. The effects of substrate surface corrugation on the equilibrium mean\nthickness of the supported graphene and the interfacial adhesion energy are\nanalyzed. Furthermore, by considering both the substrate surface corrugation\nand the mismatch strain, it is found that, while a tensile mismatch strain\nreduces the corrugation amplitude of graphene, a corrugated substrate surface\npromotes strain-induced instability under a compressive strain.

The\nLBV phase is crucial for the evolution of massive stars, and its behavior with\nmetallicity is poorly known. V39 in IC 1613 is a well-known photometric\nvariable, with B-band changes larger than 1mag. over its period. The star,\npreviously proposed to be a projection of a Galactic W Virginis and an IC 1613\nred supergiant, shows features that render it a possible LBVc.\n  Method: We investigate mid-resolution blue and red VLT-VIMOS spectra of V39,\ncovering a time span of 40 days, and perform a quantitative analysis of the\ncombined spectrum using the model atmosphere code CMFGEN.\n  Results: We identify strong Balmer and FeII P-Cygni profiles, and a hybrid\nspectrum resembling a B-A supergiant in the blue and a G-star in the red. No\nsignificant Vrad variations are detected, and the spectral changes are small\nover the photometric period. Our analysis places V39 in the low-luminosity part\nof the LBV and LBVc region, but it is also consistent with a sgB[e] star.\n  Conclusions: The radial velocity indicates that V39 belongs to IC 1613. The\nlack of Vrad changes and spectroscopic variations excludes binary scenarios.\nThe features observed are not consistent with a W Virginis star, and this\npossibility is also discarded. We propose that the star is a B-A LBVc or sgB[e]\nstar surrounded by a thick disk precessing around it.\n  If confirmed, V39 would be the lowest metallicity resolved LBV candidate\nknown to date. Alternatively, it could represent a new transient phase of\nmassive star evolution, an LBV impostor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 18:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We therefore\nexamine the potential of the colliders to distinguish models with parity\nstabilized DM from models in which the DM is stabilized by other symmetries. We\noften take the latter to be a Z_3 symmetry for illustration. We focus on\nsignatures where a single particle, charged under the DM stabilization symmetry\ndecays into the DM and Standard Model (SM) particles. Such a Z_3-charged\n\"mother\" particle can decay into one or two DM particles along with the same SM\nparticles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a Z_2-charged mother\nparticle, where only one DM particle appears. Thus, if the intermediate\nparticles in these decay chains are off-shell, then the reconstructed invariant\nmass of the SM particles exhibits two kinematic edges for the Z_3 case but only\none for the Z_2 case. For the case of on-shell intermediate particles,\ndistinguishing the two symmetries requires more than the kinematic edges. In\nthis case, we note that certain decay chain \"topologies\" of the mother particle\nwhich are present for the Z_3 case (but absent for the Z_2 case) generate a\n\"cusp\" in the invariant mass distribution of the SM particles. We demonstrate\nthat this cusp is generally invariant of the various spin configurations.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and similar\nstatistical studies of linkage data, however, assume additive models of gene\ninteractions in looking for genotype-phenotype associations. These statistical\nmethods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of\npartial influences of each individual gene and can often miss a substantial\npart of the heritable effect. Such methods do not use any biological knowledge\nabout underlying genotype-phenotype mechanisms. Modeling approaches from the AI\nfield that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform\nstatistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic\nanalysis. We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks\n(MLNs), as a framework for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical\nanalysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we have been able to\nreplicate the results of traditional statistical methods. Moreover, we show\nthat even with simple models we are able to go beyond finding independent\nmarkers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference that avoids an\nindependence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast\nsporulation, a phenotype governed by non-linear gene interactions. In addition\nto detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation,\nour method is able to identify four loci with small effects. Since their effect\non sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do\nnot account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions. We show\nhow gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be\nused as a general framework for incorporating systems biology with genetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 21:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-05"}

The\nemission from the host galaxy sources is resolved out in most cases. The\nsilicate absorption features are moderately deep and emission features are\nshallow. We compare the mid-IR luminosities to AGN luminosity tracers and found\nthat the mid-IR radiation is emitted quite isotropically. In two cases, IC5063\nand MCG-3-34-64, we find evidence for extended dust emission in the narrow-line\nregion. We confirm the correlation between observed silicate feature strength\nand Hydrogen column density recently found in Spitzer data. In a further step,\nour 3D clumpy torus model has been used to interpret the data. We show that the\nstrength of the silicate feature and the mid-IR spectral index can be used to\nget reasonable constraints on the dust distribution in the torus. The mid-IR\nspectral index, alpha, is almost exclusively determined by the radial dust\ndistribution power-law index, a, and the silicate feature depth is mostly\ndepending on the average number of clouds, N0, along an equatorial\nline-of-sight and the torus inclination. A comparison of model predictions to\nour type 1 and type 2 AGN reveals typical average parameters a=-1.0+/-0.5 and\nN0=5-8, which means that the radial dust distribution is rather shallow. As a\nproof-of-concept of this method, we compared the model parameters derived from\nalpha and the silicate feature to more detailed studies of IR SEDs and\ninterferometry and found that the constraints on a and N0 are consistent.\nFinally, we might have found evidence that the radial structure of the torus\nchanges from low to high AGN luminosities towards steeper dust distributions,\nand we discuss implications for the IR size-luminosity relation.

The vortex configurations in this system\nare generally different from those observed for single isolated triangular\nsuperconducting samples due to the coupling of vortices in adjacent funnels. At\ncertain matching fields, peaks in the critical current are absent due to the\nparticular vortex configurations that occur at these fields. We find that the\noverall depinning force increases with increasing vortex density as a result of\nthe enhanced vortex-vortex interactions caused by a crowding effect at the\nfunnel tips. When a system becomes less mobile as a result of increased\nparticle interactions, it is said to exhibit a jamming behavior. Under an\napplied drive we observe a series of elastic and plastic vortex flow phases\nwhich produce pronounced features such as jumps or dips in the transport\ncurves. In all of the flow phases, only one vortex can pass through the funnel\ntip at a time due to the vortex-vortex repulsion forces. As a consequence of\nthis constraint, we observe the remarkable result that the sum of the vortex\nvelocities at a fixed drive remains nearly constant with increasing magnetic\nfield B rather than increasing linearly. This result is similar to the behavior\nof sand in an hourglass. We also show how noise fluctuations can be used to\ndistinguish the different flow phases.

The infall-velocity distribution is given at\n(1-3)R_{200} of the main cluster (where R_{200} is similar to the virial\nradius), and thus it gives the distribution of realistic initial velocities of\nsubclusters just before collision. These velocities can be compared with the\ninitial velocities used by the non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of\n1E0657-56 in the literature. The latest parameter search carried out recently\nby Mastropietro and Burkert showed that the initial velocity of 3000 km/s at\nabout 2R_{200} is required to explain the observed shock velocity, X-ray\nbrightness ratio of the main and subcluster, and displacement of the X-ray\npeaks from the mass peaks. We show that such a high infall velocity at 2R_{200}\nis incompatible with the prediction of a LCDM model: the probability of finding\n3000 km/s in (2-3)R_{200} is between 3.3X10^{-11} and 3.6X10^{-9}. It is\nconcluded that the existence of 1E0657-56 is incompatible with the prediction\nof a LCDM model, unless a lower infall velocity solution for 1E0657-56 with <\n1800 km/s at 2R_{200} is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 02:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 02:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

First, detailed balance is observed not only in\nprofits data but also in sales data. Furthermore, the growth-rate distribution\nof sales has wider tails than the linear growth-rate distribution of profits in\nlog-log scale. On the one hand, in the mid-scale range of profits, the\nprobability of positive growth decreases and the probability of negative growth\nincreases symmetrically as the initial value increases. This is called\nNon-Gibrat's First Property. On the other hand, in the mid-scale range of\nsales, the probability of positive growth decreases as the initial value\nincreases, while the probability of negative growth hardly changes. This is\ncalled Non-Gibrat's Second Property. Under detailed balance, Non-Gibrat's First\nand Second Properties are analytically derived from the linear and quadratic\ngrowth-rate distributions in log-log scale, respectively. In both cases, the\nlog-normal distribution is inferred from Non-Gibrat's Properties and detailed\nbalance. These analytic results are verified by empirical data. Consequently,\nthis clarifies the notion that the difference in shapes between growth-rate\ndistributions of sales and profits is closely related to the difference between\nthe two Non-Gibrat's Properties in the mid-scale range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 00:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 01:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Hence, the estimation of the intrinsic population of WZ\nSge stars is important for the study of the population and evolution of CVs. In\nthis paper, we present a Bayesian approach to estimate the intrinsic period\ndistribution of dwarf novae from observed samples. In this Bayesian model, we\nassumed a simple relationship between the recurrence time and the orbital\nperiod which is consistent with observations of WZ Sge stars and other dwarf\nnovae. As a result, the minimum orbital period was estimated to be ~70 min. The\npopulation of WZ Sge stars exhibited a spike-like feature at the shortest\nperiod regime in the orbital period distribution.

For typical\nworkload traces of parallel batch jobs and Web services, our experiments show\nthat: a) In the first Cloud scenario, when the throughput is almost same like\nthat of a dedicated cluster system, our solution decreases the configuration\nsize of cluster by about 40%; b) in the second scenario, our solution decreases\nnot only the total resource consumption, but also the peak resource consumption\nmaximally to 31% with respect to that of EC2 + RightScale solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 03:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 06:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 02:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 00:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-01"}

We compare recently published recipes for SFR measures using\ncombinations of the 24 micron and observed H-alpha luminosities with those\nusing 24 micron luminosity alone. From these comparisons, we derive a reference\nSFR indicator for use in our analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the\n70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for L(70)>=1.4x10^{42} erg/s and\nL(160)>=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to SFR>=0.1-0.3 M_sun/yr. Below those\ntwo luminosity limits, the relation between SFR and 70 micron (160 micron)\nluminosity is non-linear and SFR calibrations become problematic. The\ndispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasing\nwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24\nmicron. The increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasing\ncontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations not\nassociated with the current star formation. The non-linear relation between SFR\nand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests that\nthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effective\ndust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions across\nthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. The SFR\ncalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+Log(O/H)>8.1.\nAt lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the SFR\nbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 03:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

It\nrelies on the method developed by Ren\\'e Garnier and published in 1928 in a\npaper which seems today to be totally forgotten. Garnier's approach is more\ngeometrical and constructive than the variational one, and it provides minimal\ndisks without branch point. However, it is sometimes really complicated, and\neven obscure or incomplete. Following Garnier's initial ideas, we propose a new\nproof, which intends not only to be complete, but also simpler and moderner\nthan his one. This work mainly relies on a systematic use of Fuchsian systems\nand on the relation that we establish between the reality of such systems and\ntheir monodromy. Garnier's method is based on the following fact: using the\nspinor Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces, we can associate a real\nFuchsian second-order equation, defined on the Riemann sphere, with each\nminimal disk with a polygonal boundary curve. The monodromy of the equation is\ndetermined by the oriented directions of the edges of the boundary. To solve\nthe Plateau problem, we are thus led to solve a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We\nthen proceed in two steps: first, by means of isomonodromic deformations, we\nconstruct and describe the family of all minimal disks with a polygonal\nboundary curve of given oriented directions. Then we use this description to\nstudy the edges's lengths of their boundary curves, and we show that every\npolygon is the boundary of a minimal disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 07:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 15:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-01"}

In the first approach, we apply a logistic\ntransformation to normalize the data approximately and describe the transformed\ndata using ARIMA--GARCH models so that multi-step forecasts can be iterated\neasily. In the second approach, we describe the forecast densities by truncated\nnormal distributions which are governed by two parameters, namely, the\nconditional mean and conditional variance. We apply exponential smoothing\nmethods to forecast the two parameters simultaneously. Since the underlying\nmodel of exponential smoothing is Gaussian, we are able to obtain multi-step\nforecasts of the parameters by simple iterations and thus generate forecast\ndensities as truncated normal distributions. We generate forecasts for wind\npower from 15 minutes to 24 hours ahead. Results show that the first approach\ngenerates superior forecasts and slightly outperforms the second approach under\nvarious proper scores. Nevertheless, the second approach is computationally\nmore efficient and gives more robust results under different lengths of\ntraining data.

We construct our new category by starting out from\nsemi-affinoid algebras and nested rational coverings; we prove a uniformly\nrigid acyclicity theorem, and we study coherent modules.\n  We then define formal N\\'eron models for uniformly rigid spaces to be smooth\nformal schemes of formally finite type satisfying the universal N\\'eron\nproperty. We establish the existence of formal N\\'eron models for certain\nclasses of uniformly rigid groups, and we discuss applications to Chai's\nprogram concerning the computation of the base change conductor for abelian\nvarieties with potentially multiplicative reduction.\n  This paper is a faithful copy of the author's doctoral thesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 12:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-05"}

Probably our Universe has arisen as a\nvacuum fluctuation and very probably that it has had a high symmetry for\nPlanckian parameters. Besides, vacuum energy density has to be a positive one.\nIn the early epochs during its cooling the Universe had been losing the high\nsymmetry by phase transitions since condensates of quantum fields carried\nnegative contributions (78 orders) to its positive energy density. It was the\nperiod of the Universe evolution during the first parts of the first second of\nits life. After the last phase transition (quark-hadron) the vacuum energy `has\nhardened'. In this moment its energy density can be calculated using the\nZeldovich's formula inserting an average value of the pseudo-Goldstone boson\nmasses (pi-mesons) that characterizes this chromodynamical vacuum. The chiral\nsymmetry was then lost. Dynamics of the equilibrium vacuum after its `hardness'\nis considered by applying the holographic conception. In this case the Universe\nhas been losing vacuum energy (45 orders) on organization of new quantum states\nduring 13.76 x 10^9 years. Using this conception we can get solution of the\ncosmological constant problem. 123 crisis orders problem may be resolved.

This translation, effectively, changes neither the total\nmomentum, nor the de Broglie wave length of the electron, nor the linear size\nof the atom corresponding to the diameter of the electron orbit. But, this\ntranslation implies a small nucleus momentum and nuclear de Broglie wavelength\nalmost hundred times larger than the electron de Broglie wavelength.

This long-range gauge field outside the area\npierced by a magnetic field is due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which is a\nnon-classical phenomenon that illustrates the significance of potentials rather\nthan forces in quantum mechanics. In the London gauge, the phase of the\ncondensate is given by the polar angle around the vortex. Here we raise the\nquestion whether this phase shift could be detected by means of Cooper pair\ninterferometry using Josephson junctions as phase-sensitive detectors. We\nintroduce a single Abrikosov vortex into a superconducting lead with a detector\njunction made at the edge of the lead. We observe that the vortex induces a\nJosephson phase shift equal to the polar angle of the vortex within the\njunction length. When the vortex is close to the junction it induces a pi-step\nin the Josephson phase difference, leading to a controllable and reversible\nswitching of the junction into the 0 - pi state. This in turn results in an\nunusual Phi_0/2 quantization of the flux in the junction.

A further important dilemma in the standard model is the\nLithium problem, which is the substantial mismatch between the theoretical\nprediction for 7-Li from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the value that we observe\ntoday. This observation is one of the very few we have from along our past\nworldline as opposed to our past lightcone. By releasing the untested\nassumption that the universe is homogeneous on very large scales, both apparent\nacceleration and the Lithium problem can be easily accounted for as different\naspects of cosmic inhomogeneity, without causing problems for other\ncosmological phenomena such as the cosmic microwave background.

Formally, it should\nacquire a (gauge-dependent) AB relative phase between the charge states, even\nfor an incomplete loop. If measureable, such a geometric, rather than\ntopological, AB-phase would seem to break gauge invariance. Wick, Wightman and\nWigner argued that since (global) charge-dependent phase transformations are\nphysically unobservable, charge state superpositions are unphysical (`charge\nsuperselection rule'). This would resolve the apparent paradox in a trivial\nway. However, Aharonov and Susskind disputed this superselection rule: they\ndistinguished between such global charge-dependent transformations, and\ntransformations of the relative inter-charge phases of two particles, and\nshowed that the latter \\emph{could} in principle be observable! Finally, the\nparadox again disappears once we considers the `calibration' of the phase\nmeasured by the Aharonov-Susskind phase detectors, as well as the phase of the\nparticle at its initial point. It turns out that such a detector can only\ndistinguish between the relative phases of two paths if their (oriented)\ndifference forms a loop around the flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 13:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We have extended\nour previous mathematical model describing the nonlinear dynamics of Th1-Th2\nregulation by including Treg cells and their major cytokines. We hypothesize\nthat immunotherapy mainly acts on the T cell level and that the decisive\nprocess can be regarded as a dynamical phenomenon. The model consists of\nnonlinear differential equations which describe the proliferation and mutual\nsuppression of different T cell subsets. The old version of the model was based\nupon the Th1-Th2 paradigm and is successful in describing the \"Th1-Th2 switch\"\nwhich was considered the decisive event during specific immunotherapy. In\nrecent years, however, the Th1-Th2 paradigm has been questioned and therefore,\nwe have investigated a modified model in order to account for the influence of\na regulatory T cell type. We examined the extended model by means of numerical\nsimulations and analytical methods. As the modified model is more complex, we\nhad to develop new methods to portray its characteristics. The concept of\nstable manifolds of fixed points of a stroboscobic map turned out to be\nespecially important. We found that when including regulatory T cells, our\nmodel can describe the events in allergen-specific immunotherapy more\naccurately. Our results suggest that the decisive effect of immunotherapy, the\nincreased proliferation of Treg and suppression of Th2 cells, crucially depends\non the administration of high dose injections right before the maintenance\nphase sets in. Empirical protocols could therefore be improved by optimizing\nthis step of therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 14:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-05"}

The parametric model is based on a flexible\nmultivariate Poisson-lognormal distribution and is seen to be a natural\ngeneralization of the univariate Poisson-lognormal models used in ecological\nstudies of biodiversity patterns. The procedure for evaluating model's fit is\ndescribed along with the public domain software developed to perform the\nnecessary diagnostics. The model-driven analysis is seen to compare favorably\nvis a vis traditional methods when applied to the data from T-cell receptors in\ntransgenic mice populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 15:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-05"}

Ten sessions of\nobservations with the Very Long Baseline Array have been conducted over the\ncourse of $\\sim$5 years, with a total of 1339 images produced for the 274\nsources. There are several quantities that can be used to characterize the\nimpact of intrinsic source structure on astrometric observations including the\nsource flux density, the flux density variability, the source structure index,\nthe source compactness, and the compactness variability. A detailed analysis of\nthese imaging quantities shows that (1) our selection of compact sources from\n8.4 GHz catalogs yielded sources with flux densities, averaged over the\nsessions in which each source was observed, of about 1 Jy at both 24 and 43\nGHz, (2) on average the source flux densities at 24 GHz varied by 20%-25%\nrelative to their mean values, with variations in the session-to-session flux\ndensity scale being less than 10%, (3) sources were found to be more compact\nwith less intrinsic structure at higher frequencies, and (4) variations of the\ncore radio emission relative to the total flux density of the source are less\nthan 8% on average at 24 GHz. We conclude that the reduction in the effects due\nto source structure gained by observing at higher frequencies will result in an\nimproved CRF and a pool of high-quality fiducial reference points for use in\nspacecraft navigation over the next decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 22:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We refine the phase diagram for 3d, and determine\nthe line free energy in 2d, the height of the nucleation barrier in 2d and 3d\nfor homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation by solving the respective\nEuler-Lagrange (EL) equations. We demonstrate that in the PFC model, the\nbody-centered cubic (bcc), the face-centered cubic (fcc), and the hexagonal\nclose packed structures (hcp) compete, while the simple cubic structure is\nunstable, and that phase preference can be tuned by changing the model\nparameters: close to the critical point the bcc structure is stable, while far\nfrom the critical point the fcc prevails, with an hcp stability domain in\nbetween. We note that with increasing distance from the critical point the\nequilibrium shapes vary from sphere to the specific faceted shapes:\nrhombic-dodecahedron (bcc), truncated-octahedron (fcc), and hexagonal prism\n(hcp). Solving the equation of motion of the PFC model supplied with conserved\nnoise, solidification starts with the nucleation of an amorphous precursor\nphase, into which the stable crystalline phase nucleates. The growth rate is\nfound to be time dependent and anisotropic, which anisotropy depends on the\ndriving force. We show that due to the diffusion-controlled growth mechanism,\nwhich is especially relevant for crystal aggrega-tion in colloidal systems,\ndendritic growth structures evolve in large-scale isothermal single-component\nPFC simula-tions. Finally, we present results for eutectic solidification in a\nbinary PFC model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2010 15:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
