Mass is the most important parameter\nof a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around\nthe planet-star center of mass. A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast. In this paper we address the question: \"Can a prior\nastrometric mission that can identify which stars have Earthlike planets\nsignificantly improve the science yield of a mission to image exo-Earths?\" We\nfind that the Occulting Ozone Observatory (a small external occulter mission\nthat cannot measure spectra) could confirm the orbits of ~4 to ~5 times as many\nexo-Earths if an astrometric mission preceded it to identify which stars had\nsuch planets.

I consider the evolution of the magnetic\nfield inside such a bubble, using a mixture of analytic and numerical methods.\nIt is found that the field relaxes into an equilibrium filling the entire\nvolume of the bubble. The timescale on which this happens depends critically on\nthe magnetisation and helicity of the outflow as well as on properties of the\nsurrounding ICM. If the outflow is strongly magnetised, the magnetic field\nundergoes reconnection on a short timescale, magnetic energy being converted\ninto heat whilst the characteristic length scale of the field rises; this\nprocess stops when a global equilibrium is reached. The strength of the\nequilibrium field is determined by the magnetic helicity injected into the\nbubble by the AGN: if the outflow has a consistent net flux and consequently a\nlarge helicity then a global equilibrium will be reached on a short timescale,\nwhereas a low-helicity outflow results in no global equilibrium being reached\nand at the time of observation reconnection will be ongoing. However, localised\nflux-tube equilibria will form. If, on the other hand, the outflow is very\nweakly magnetised, no reconnection occurs and the magnetic field inside the\nbubble remains small-scale and passive. These results have implications for the\ninternal composition of the bubbles, their interaction with ICM -- in\nparticular to explain how bubbles could move a large distance through the ICM\nwithout breaking up -- as well as for the cooling flow problem in general.

Of those sources, the\nvast majority of the emission originates in systems with low to moderate IR\nluminosities (L_{IR}<10^{12} $L_sun); the most luminous objects contribute\nsignificant flux only at high-redshifts (z>2).

The actual distribution from which it is drawn depends on the\nintrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being studied. We\ngive a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several\n\"toy models\" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of M_T. The\nresults show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for\nsimple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in an\nobserved RV sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 value\nfor an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quite\nplausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively.

The differential effects of\nmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that two\ndistinct processes are operating, \"mass-quenching\" and \"environment-quenching\".\nEnvironment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with\nepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops in\nthe Universe. The observed constancy of the mass-function shape for\nstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around and\nabove M*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z < 2. We\npostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broader\nrange of stellar mass and epoch. These two simple quenching processes, plus\nsome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) a\nquasi-static Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value of\nM* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation and\nmass-quenching rates, (b) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with\ntwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactly\nthe same M* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, while\nthe other is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alpha as\nthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.\nSubsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat in\nthe denser environments, slightly increasing M* and making alpha more negative.\nAll of these detailed quantitative relationships between the Schechter\nparameters are indeed seen in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple\nempirically-based model.

We start\nby observing that supersymmetry implies that the structure constants of the\nreal numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions can be identified with\nthe chirotope concept. This means, among other things, that normed divisions\nalgebras, which are only possible in 1,2, 4 or 8-dimensions, are linked to\noriented matroid theory. Therefore, we argue that the possibility for\ndeveloping loop quantum gravity in 8-dimensions must be taken as important\nalternative. Moreover, we show that in 4-dimensions, loop quantum gravity\ntheories in the (1+3) or (0+4) signatures are not the only possibilities. In\nfact, we show that loop quantum gravity associated with the (2+2)-signature may\nalso be an interesting physical structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 20:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}

This dilemma\nis solved with a novel quantum decay mechanism that causes a singlet to triplet\ndecay in about 300 femtoseconds. The decay is mediated by the triplet\nmetal-centered state ($^3$MC) state even though there is no direct coupling\nbetween the $^1$MLCT and $^3$MC states. The coupling between the $^3$MLCT and\n$^3$MC via excited phonon states leads to vibrational cooling that allows the\nlocal system to dissipate the excess energy. In the relaxed state, the\npopulation of the $^3$MC state is low and the metal-ligand bond length is\nalmost unchanged with respect to the initial photoexcited state, in agreement\nwith experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 20:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}

According to our results, future tropical cyclones will\nnot evolve to Category 5 until the next decadal minimum that is, by the year\n2015 +/- 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 22:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-26"}

In our\nprevious paper Kato et al. (2009), we have shown that a steady angular velocity\nprofile that consists of both super and sub-Keplerian regions is created in the\ndisk through non-uniform excitation of Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI).\nSuch non-uniform MRI excitation is reasonably expected in a part of disks with\nrelatively low ionization degree. In this paper, we show through\nthree-dimensional resistive MHD simulations with test particles that this\nradial structure of the angular velocity indeed leads to prevention of\nspiral-in of dust particles and furthermore to their accumulation at the\nboundary of super-Keplerian and sub-Keplerian regions. Treating dust particles\nas test particles, their motions under the influence of the non-uniform MRI\nthrough gas drag are simulated. In the most favorable cases (meter-size dust\nparticles in the disk region with a relatively large fraction of MRI-stable\nregion), we found that the dust concentration is peaked around the\nsuper/sub-Keplerian flow boundary and the peak dust density is 10,000 times as\nhigh as the initial value. The peak density is high enough for the subsequent\ngravitational instability to set in, suggesting a possible route to\nplanetesimal formation via non-uniformly excited MRI in weakly ionized regions\nof a disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 03:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\nsource experiences recurrent flares on timescales of hours. The soft X-ray\nvariations, up to a factor of ~4, are much stronger than the hard X-ray\nvariations. With higher energy, the variability amplitude increases in the soft\nX-rays but decreases in the hard X-rays. The hard X-ray variability amplitude,\nhowever, is effectively large. For the first time, we detect a soft lag of\n~1000s between the soft and hard X-ray variations. The soft lags might become\nlarger with larger energy differences. The overall X-ray spectra exhibit a\nsofter-when-brighter trend, whereas the soft X-ray spectra appear to show a\nharder-when-brighter trend. The concave X-ray spectra of the source can be\ninterpreted as the sum of the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission,\ndominating in the soft X rays, and the low-energy end of the inverse Compton\n(IC) emission, contributing more in the hard X-rays.

Advantages of our proposition are: (1)\ncommutativity of operations is determined at compile-time, (2) run-time\nchecking is as efficient as for compatibility, (3) neither commutativity\nrelations, (4) nor inverse operations, need to be specified, and (5) log space\nutilization is reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 09:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-08"}

As a consequence, most seemingly normal disk galaxies should be\nsurrounded by spatially extended stellar 'tidal features' of low surface\nbrightness. As part of a pilot survey for such interaction signatures, we have\ncarried out ultra deep, wide field imaging of 8 isolated spiral galaxies in the\nLocal Volume, with data taken at small (D=0.1-0.5m) robotic telescopes that\nprovide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity (mu_V)~28.5$ mag/arcsec^2).\nThis initial observational effort has led to the discovery of six previously\nundetected extensive (to ~30 kpc) stellar structures in the halos surrounding\nthese galaxies, likely debris from tidally disrupted satellites. In addition,\nwe confirm and clarify several enormous stellar over-densities previously\nreported in the literature, but never before interpreted as tidal streams. Even\nthis pilot sample of galaxies exhibits strikingly diverse morphological\ncharacteristics of these extended stellar features: great circle-like features\nthat resemble the Sagittarius stream surrounding the Milky Way, remote shells\nand giant clouds of presumed tidal debris far beyond the main stelar body, as\nwell as jet-like features emerging from galactic disks. A qualitative\ncomparison with available simulations set in a Lambda-Cold Dark Matter\ncosmology shows that the extraordinary variety of stellar morphologies detected\nin this pilot survey matches that seen in those simulations. The common\nexistence of these tidal features around 'normal' disk galaxies and the\nmorphological match to the simulations constitutes new evidence that these\ntheoretical models also apply to a large number of other Milky Way-mass disk\ngalaxies in the Local Volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 11:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2010 22:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In F-theory, the moduli of the D7-branes and the\nmoduli of the orientifold are unified in the moduli space of an elliptic\nCalabi-Yau manifold. This makes it possible to study the flux stabilization of\nD7-branes in an elegant manner. To answer phenomenological questions, one has\nto translate the deformations of the elliptic Calabi-Yau manifold of F-theory\nback to the positions and the shape of the D7-branes. We address this problem\nby constructing the homology cycles that are relevant for the deformations of\nthe elliptic Calabi-Yau manifold. We show the viability of our approach for the\ncase of elliptic two- and three-folds. Furthermore, we discuss consistency\nconditions related to the intersections between D7-branes and orientifold\nplanes which are automatically fulfilled in F-theory.

Of the 92 with detections in\nat least two far infrared bands, 62 are dominated by an M82-like starburst, 22\nby an Arp220-like starburst and 8 by an AGN dust torus. On the basis of\nprevious gravitational lensing studies and an examination of HST archive images\nfor a further 5 objects, we estimate the fraction of HLIRGs that are\nsignificantly lensed to be 10-30%. We show simple infrared template fits to the\nSEDs of 23 HLIRGs with spectroscopic redshifts and at least 5 photometric\nbands. Most can be fitted with a combination of two simple templates: an AGN\ndust torus and an M82-like starburst. In the optical, 17 of the objects are\nfitted with QSO templates, 6 are fitted with galaxy templates. 20 of the 23\nobjects (87%) show evidence of an AGN either from the optical continuum or from\nthe signature of an AGN dust torus, but the starburst component is the dominant\ncontribution to bolometric luminosity in 14 out of 23 objects (61%). The\nimplied star-formation rates, even after correcting for lensing magnification,\nare in excess of 1000 Mo /yr. We use infrared template-fitting models to\npredict fluxes for all HLIRGs at submillimetre wavelengths, and show\npredictions at 350 and 850 mu. Most would have 850 mu fluxes brighter than 5\nmJy so should be easily detectable with current submillimetre telescopes. At\nleast 15% should be detectable in the Planck all-sky survey at 350 mu and all\nPlanck all-sky survey sources with z < 0.9 should be IIFSCz sources. From the\nluminosity-volume test we find that HLIRGs show strong evolution.

Tracing H-alpha emission up to 50% beyond the optical\nradius, R_25, we find a composite H-alpha surface brightness profile, well\ndescribed by a broken-exponential law, that drops more steeply in the outer\ndisk, but which is not truncated. The stellar continuum and H-alpha surface\nbrightness both exhibit a break at ~0.7 R_25, but the H-alpha emission drops\nmore steeply than the stellar continuum beyond that break.

For\nthis purpose, we developed a new ODE solver for the recombination problem,\nbased on an implicit Gear's method. This solver allows us to include up to 350\nl-resolved shells or ~61 000 separate levels in the hydrogen model and to solve\nthe recombination problem for one cosmology in ~27 hours. This is a huge\nimprovement in performance over our previous recombination code, for which a\n100-shell computation (5050 separate states) already required ~150 hours on a\nsingle processor. We show that for 350 shells down to redshift z ~200 the\nresults for the free electron fraction have practically converged. The final\nmodification in the free electron fraction at z ~200 decreases from about\n\\DeltaNe/Ne ~2.8% for 100 shells to \\DeltaNe/Ne ~1.6% for 350 shells. However,\nthe associated changes in the CMB power spectra at large multipoles l are\nrather small, so that for accurate computations in connection with the analysis\nof Planck data already ~100 shells are expected to be sufficient. Nevertheless,\nthe total value of \\tau could still be affected at a significant level. We also\nbriefly investigate the effect of collisions on the recombination dynamics.\nWith our current estimates for the collisional rates we find a correction of\n\\DeltaNe/Ne ~ -0.088% at z ~ 700, which is mainly caused by l-changing\ncollisions with protons. Furthermore, we present results on the cosmological\nrecombination spectrum, showing that at low frequencies collisional processes\nare important. However, the current accuracy of collisional rates is\ninsufficient for precise computations of templates for the recombination\nspectrum at \\nu<~1 GHz, and also the effect of collisions on the recombination\ndynamics suffers from the uncertainty in these rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 14:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 18:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
