We first illustrate\nthe basic LM model in which the conditional distribution of each response\nvariable given the corresponding latent variable and the initial and transition\nprobabilities of the latent process are unconstrained. For this model we also\nillustrate in detail maximum likelihood estimation through the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm, which may be efficiently implemented by\nrecursions known in the hidden Markov literature. We then illustrate several\nconstrained versions of the basic LM model, which make the model more\nparsimonious and allow us to include and test hypotheses of interest.

Unfortunately, for high rates of innovation, existing\nsampling schemes are numerically unstable. In this paper we propose a general\nsampling approach which leads to stable recovery even in the presence of many\npulses.

This is\nthe second in a series of papers that systematically study the large-scale\nproperties of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) gas in nearby radio galaxies. The main\ngoal is to investigate the importance of gas-rich galaxy mergers and\ninteractions among radio-loud AGN. In this paper we present results of a\ncomplete sample of classical low-power radio galaxies. We find that extended\nFanaroff & Riley type-I radio sources are generally not associated with\ngas-rich galaxy mergers or ongoing violent interactions, but occur in\nearly-type galaxies without large (> 10^8 M_sun) amounts of extended neutral\nhydrogen gas. In contrast, enormous discs/rings of HI gas (with sizes up to 190\nkpc and masses up to 2 x 10^10 M_sun) are detected around the host galaxies of\na significant fraction of the compact radio sources in our sample. This\nsegregation in HI mass with radio source size likely indicates that these\ncompact radio sources are either confined by large amounts of gas in the\ncentral region, or that their fuelling is inefficient and different from the\nfuelling process of classical FR-I radio sources. To first order, the overall\nHI properties of our complete sample (detection rate, mass and morphology)\nappear similar to those of radio-quiet early-type galaxies. If confirmed by\nbetter statistics, this would imply that low-power radio-AGN activity may be a\nshort and recurrent phase that occurs at some point during the lifetime of many\nearly-type galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 00:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For theories that obey our\nassumptions, the bound resolves the \"species problem\": the tension between the\ngeometric, species-independent nature of black hole entropy and the\nproportionality of ordinary thermodynamic entropy to the number of species. We\nthen show that, when black holes in Einstein's theory are compared to those in\nthe extended theories at a fixed value of mass, the entropy of the Einstein\nblack holes will always be minimal. Similar considerations are also applied to\nthe entropy density of black branes in anti-de Sitter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 05:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

However, the fragility of quantum states poses a challenging obstacle\nfor realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The topological approach\nto quantum computation proposes to surmount this obstacle by using special\nphysical systems -- non-Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter -- that\nwould provide intrinsic fault-tolerance at the hardware level. The so-called\n\"Ising-type\" non-Abelian topological order is likely to be physically realized\nin a number of systems, but it can only provide a universal gate set (a\nrequisite for quantum computation) if one has the ability to perform certain\ndynamical topology-changing operations on the system.

The\nintergranular junction has strong red shifts, darker intensities than the\nregular intergranular lanes, and surface converging flows. This clearly\nconfirms that the converging and downward convective motions are essential for\nthe approaching process of the opposite-polarity magnetic elements. However,\nmotion of the approaching magnetic elements does not always match with their\nsurrounding surface flow patterns in our observations. This suggests that, in\naddition to the surface flows, subsurface downward convective motions and\nsubsurface magnetic connectivities are important for understanding the approach\nand collision of the opposite polarity elements observed in the photosphere. We\nfind that the horizontal magnetic field appears between the canceling opposite\npolarity elements in only one event. The horizontal fields are observed along\nthe intergranular lanes with Doppler red shifts. This cancellation is most\nprobably a result of the submergence (retraction) of low-lying photospheric\nmagnetic flux.

The key\npoint is that the trigonometric approximation \"inherits\" the multiband\nproperty, that is, its coefficients are formed by bursts of non-zero elements\ncorresponding to the multiband components. It is shown that this method can be\nwell combined with the recently proposed synchronous multi-rate sampling (SMRS)\nscheme, given that the resulting linear system is sparse and formed by ones and\nzeroes.

For example, Michelson in 1881 thought that he built\nan instrument that (when you turn it in the horizontal plane) will measure in\nvacuum (refractive index n=1) the harmonic shift of the interference fringe. In\nreality the case is much more involved. Not at once it was understood (the\nmisunderstanding lasted about 90 years) that the shift of interference fringe\noccurs only when the carriers of light contain particles, i.e. have n>1. In\n1968-1975 I have demonstrated experimentally that during the pumping of the gas\nfrom the zones where the light propagates, i.e. with decreasing the number of\nparticles of the light's carrier, along with the reduction of noise\ndisturbances always necessarily vanishes the harmonic shift of the interference\nfringe. As soon as the correlation of the observability of the fringe shift\nwith the concentration of particles in the light's carrier has been taken into\naccount, I was able to reliably measure the speed of absolute motion of the\nEarth as a few hundred km/s. In the sixth version I corrected the slip in\nformula (21). There is suggested for experimenters the advice how to diminish\nbelow the measurable level of the sought-for signal the harmful influence of\nthe noise and false interferences, and for interpreters of measurements of\nnon-zero fringe shift the derivation is given of a relativistically invariant\nformula of the aether wind speed that agrees with the experiments in optical\nmedia with 1<n<1.8.

The dynamical mass of the ring\nbased on HI absorption is 3.1 x 10E9 Msun.

Here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associated\npost-processing nucleosynthesis and multi-wavelength radiation transport\ncalculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The light\ncurves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement with\nobserved properties of Type Ia supernovae. In particular, for white dwarf\nmasses from 0.97 - 1.15 Msun we obtain 56Ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 Msun,\nsufficient to capture almost the complete range of Type Ia supernova\nbrightnesses. Our optical light curve rise times, peak colours and decline\ntimescales display trends which are generally consistent with observed\ncharacteristics although the range of B-band decline timescales displayed by\nour current set of models is somewhat too narrow. In agreement with\nobservations, the maximum light spectra of the models show clear features\nassociated with intermediate mass elements and reproduce the sense of the\nobserved correlation between explosion luminosity and the ratio of the Si II\nlines at 6355 and 5972 Angstroms.

This paper provides\nsufficient conditions under which the continuity of the value function is\nobtained.

The effect\nof embedding Split ring resonators (SRR) in a frequency- dispersive medium with\nLorentz-like dispersion or with dispersion engineered by electromagnetic\ninduced transparency (EIT), is manifested in the splitting of the negative\npermeability band, the modified (frequency-dependent) filling fractions and\ndissipation factors.

Spectral lines from atoms and molecules in\nprimordial perturbations at high redshifts can give information about the\nconditions in the early universe before and during the formation of the first\nstars in addition to the epoch of reionisation. The lines may arise from moving\nprimordial perturbations before the formation of the first stars (resonant\nscattering lines), or could be thermal absorption or emission lines at lower\nredshifts. The difficulties in these searches are that the source redshift and\nevolutionary state, as well as molecular species and transition are unknown,\nwhich implies that an observed line can fall within a wide range of\nfrequencies. The lines are also expected to be very weak. Observations from\nspace have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features\nwhich is important in such observations. We have therefore, as a first step in\nour searches, used the Odin satellite to perform two sets of spectral line\nsurveys towards several positions. The first survey covered the band 547-578\nGHz towards two positions, and the second one covered the bands 542.0-547.5 GHz\nand 486.5-492.0 GHz towards six positions selected to test different sizes of\nthe primordial clouds. Two deep searches centred at 543.250 and 543.100 GHz\nwith 1 GHz bandwidth were also performed towards one position. The two lowest\nrotational transitions of H2 will be redshifted to these frequencies from\nz~20-30, which is the predicted epoch of the first star formation. No lines are\ndetected at an rms level of 14-90 and 5-35 mK for the two surveys,\nrespectively, and 2-7 mK in the deep searches with a channel spacing of 1-16\nMHz. The broad bandwidth covered allows a wide range of redshifts to be\nexplored for a number of atomic and molecular species and transitions. From the\ntheoretical side, our sensitivity analysis show that the largest possible\namplitudes of the resonant lines are about 1 mK at frequencies <200 GHz, and a\nfew micro K around 500-600 GHz, assuming optically thick lines and no\nbeam-dilution. However, if existing, thermal absorption lines have the\npotential to be orders of magnitude stronger than the resonant lines. We make a\nsimple estimation of the sizes and masses of the primordial perturbations at\ntheir turn-around epochs, which previously has been identified as the most\nfavourable epoch for a detection. This work may be considered as an important\npilot study for our forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space\nObservatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 15:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Using the FU-HYU catalogue we present\ncolour-colour diagrams that map the passage of PAH features through our\nobservation bands. We find that the longer mid-infrared bands from AKARI\n(IRC-L18W 18 micron band) and Spitzer (MIPS24 24 micron band) provide an\naccurate measure of the total MIR emission of the sources and therefore their\nprobable total mid-infrared luminosity. We also find that colours incorporating\nthe AKARI IRC-S11 11 micron band produce a bimodal distribution where an excess\nat 11 microns preferentially selects moderate redshift star-forming galaxies.\nThese powerful colour-colour diagnostics are further used as tools to extract\nanomalous colour populations, in particular a population of Silicate Break\ngalaxies from the GOODS-N field showing that dusty starbursts can be selected\nof specific redshift ranges (z=1.2 - 1.6) by mid-infrared drop-out techniques.\nThe FU-HYU catalogue will be made publically available to the astronomical\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 12:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
