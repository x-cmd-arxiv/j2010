In 2002, Kalai asked whether\none can obtain the following quantitative version of the theorem: For any\n$\\epsilon>0$, there exists $\\delta=\\delta(\\epsilon)$ such that if a GSWF on\nthree alternatives satisfies the IIA condition and its probability of\nnon-transitive outcome is at most $\\delta$, then the GSWF is at most\n$\\epsilon$-far from being a dictatorship or from breaching the Unanimity\ncondition.

The\nmotions were apparently driven by the restoring magnetic forces resulting from\nthe CME impingement, suggestive of magnetohydrodynamic kink mode propagating\noutwards along the plasma sheet of the streamer. The mode is supported\ncollectively by the streamer-plasma sheet structure and is therefore named\n\"streamer wave\" in the present study.

We investigate the\nseparate impact of these two types of information on cosmological parameter\nestimation, and show that for the simplest cosmological models, the broad-band\nshape information currently contained in the SDSS DR7 halo power spectrum (HPS)\nis by far superseded by geometric information derived from the baryonic\nfeatures. An immediate corollary is that contrary to popular beliefs, the upper\nlimit on the neutrino mass m_\\nu presently derived from LSS combined with\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) data does not in fact arise from the possible\nsmall-scale power suppression due to neutrino free-streaming, if we limit the\nmodel framework to minimal LambdaCDM+m_\\nu. However, in more complicated\nmodels, such as those extended with extra light degrees of freedom and a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w differing from -1, shape information\nbecomes crucial for the resolution of parameter degeneracies. This conclusion\nwill remain true even when data from the Planck surveyor become available. In\nthe course of our analysis, we introduce a new dewiggling procedure that allows\nus to extend consistently the use of the SDSS HPS to models with an arbitrary\nsound horizon at decoupling.
