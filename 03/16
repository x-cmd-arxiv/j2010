In this report we present\na selection of new reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly\nsensitive to the symmetry term of the nuclear Equation of State ($Iso-EoS$). We\nwill first discuss the Isospin Equilibration Dynamics. At low energies this\nmanifests via the recently observed Dynamical Dipole Radiation, due to a\ncollective neutron-proton oscillation with the symmetry term acting as a\nrestoring force. At higher beam energies Iso-EoS effects will be seen in an\nIsospin Diffusion mechanism, via Imbalance Ratio Measurements, in particular\nfrom correlations to the total kinetic energy loss. For fragmentation reactions\nin central events we suggest to look at the coupling between isospin\ndistillation and radial flow. In Neck Fragmentation reactions important Iso-EoS\ninformation can be obtained from fragment isospin content, velocity and\nalignement correlations. The high density symmetry term can be probed from\nisospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies (few AGeV\nrange), in particular for high transverse momentum selections of the reaction\nproducts. Rather isospin sensitive observables are proposed from\nnucleon/cluster emissions, collective flows and meson production. The\npossibility to shed light on the controversial neutron/proton effective mass\nsplitting in asymmetric matter is also suggested.\n  A large symmetry repulsion at high baryon density will also lead to an\n\"earlier\" hadron-deconfinement transition in n-rich matter. The binodal\ntransition line of the (T,\\rho_B) diagram is lowered to a region accessible\nthrough heavy ion collisions in the energy range of the new planned facilities,\ne.g. the FAIR/NICA projects. Some observable effects of the formation of a\nMixed Phase are suggested, in particular a Neutron Trapping mechanism. The\ndependence of the results on a suitable treatment of the isovector part of the\ninteraction in effective QCD Lagrangian approaches is critically discussed. We\nstress the interest of this study in nuclear astrophysics, in particular for\nsupernovae explosions and neutron star structure, where the knowledge of the\nIso-EoS is important at low as well as at high baryon density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 16:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

However, the explanations for a number of cosmological phenomena\nsuch as inflation, dark energy, symmetry breakings, and phase transitions need\nthe presence of classical scalar fields. Although the process of condensation\nof scalar fields in the lab is fairly well understood, the extension of results\nto a cosmological context is not trivial. Here we investigate the formation of\na condensate - a classical scalar field - after reheating of the Universe. We\nassume a light quantum scalar field produced by the decay of a heavy particle,\nwhich for simplicity is assumed to be another scalar. We show that during\nradiation domination epoch under certain conditions, the decay of the heavy\nparticle alone is sufficient for the production of a condensate. This process\nis very similar to preheating - the exponential particle production at the end\nof inflation. During matter domination epoch when the expansion of the Universe\nis faster, the decay alone can not keep the growing trend of the field and the\namplitude of the condensate decreases rapidly, unless there is a self\ninteraction. This issue is particularly important for dark energy. We show that\nquantum corrections of the self-interaction play a crucial role in this\nprocess. Notably, they induce an effective action which includes inverse\npower-law terms, and therefore can lead to a tracking behaviour even when the\nclassical self-interaction is a simple power-law of order 3 or 4. This removes\nthe necessity of having nonrenormalisable terms in the Lagrangian. If dark\nenergy is the condensate of a quantum scalar field, these results show that its\npresence is deeply related to the action of quantum physics at largest\nobservable scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 19:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

That is, at the loop level, matter\nsources curvature through a gravitational coupling that is a non-local function\nof the covariant d'Alembertian.

Observational data have revealed a\nfew inconsistencies with predictions from the $\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$ model. For\nexample, most massive galaxies have already been observed at very high\nredshifts, and they have experienced only mild evolution since then. In\nconflict with this, semi-analytical models of galaxy formation predict an\ninsufficient number of massive galaxies at high redshift and a rapid evolution\nbetween redshift 1 and 0 . In addition, there is a strong correlation between\nstar formation rate and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, which can be\nroughly reproduced with the model, but with a normalization that is too low at\nhigh redshift. Furthermore, the stellar mass density obtained from the integral\nof the cosmic star formation history is higher than the measured one by a\nfactor of 2. In this paper, we study these issues using a semi-analytical model\nthat includes: 1) cold gas accretion in massive halos at high redshift; 2)\ntidal stripping of stellar mass from satellite galaxies; and 3) an evolving\nstellar initial mass function (bottom-light) with a higher gas recycle\nfraction.

We present here a theoretical investigation of the nature of\nthese \"helical metals\" - bulk metals with helical surface states. We explore\nhow the surface and bulk states can mix, in both clean and disordered systems.\nUsing the Fano model, we discover that in a clean system, the helical surface\nstates are \\emph{not} simply absorbed by hybridization with a non-topological\nparasitic metallic band. Instead, they are pushed away from overlapping in\nmomentum and energy with the bulk states, leaving behind a finite-lifetime\nsurface resonance in the bulk energy band. Furthermore, the hybridization may\nlead in some cases to multiplied surface state bands, in all cases retaining\nthe helical characteristic. Weak disorder leads to very similar effects -\nsurface states are pushed away from the energy bandwidth of the bulk, leaving\nbehind a finite-lifetime surface resonance in place of the original surface\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 20:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 23:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 02:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-20"}

The roughly linear cumulative size\ndistribution (uniform in a differential distribution) can result from the\ncombination of a deceleration during this phase, a transition to a\nradiation-loss-dominated phase at a radius that depends on the local gas\ndensity, and a distribution of ambient densities varying roughly as rho^{-1}.\nThis explanation is supported by the observed -1 power-law distributions of\nthree independent tracers of density: HI column density, Halpha surface\nbrightness, and star formation rate from resolved stellar populations. In this\npicture, the observed cutoff at r~30 pc in the SNR size distribution is due to\na minimum in the mean ambient gas density in the regions where supernovae (SNe)\nexplode.

De Poi\nand F. Zucconi classified curves with apolarity $g-2$ when $k$ is the complex\nfield. In this paper, we give a complete, characteristic free, classification\nof curves $C$ with apolarity $g-1$ (and $g-2$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 21:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}

Pebbling has proven a useful tool for studying\nresolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different\nsubsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space\ntrade-offs. The typical approach has been to encode the pebble game played on a\ngraph as a CNF formula and then argue that proofs of this formula must inherit\n(various aspects of) the pebbling properties of the underlying graph.\nUnfortunately, the reductions used here are not tight. To simulate resolution\nproofs by pebblings, the full strength of nondeterministic black-white pebbling\nis needed, whereas resolution is only known to be able to simulate\ndeterministic black pebbling. To obtain strong results, one therefore needs to\nfind specific graph families which either have essentially the same properties\nfor black and black-white pebbling (not at all true in general) or which admit\nsimulations of black-white pebblings in resolution. This paper contributes to\nboth these approaches. First, we design a restricted form of black-white\npebbling that can be simulated in resolution and show that there are graph\nfamilies for which such restricted pebblings can be asymptotically better than\nblack pebblings. This proves that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, resolution\ncan strictly beat black-only pebbling, and in particular that the space lower\nbounds on pebbling formulas in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008] are tight.\nSecond, we present a versatile parametrized graph family with essentially the\nsame properties for black and black-white pebbling, which gives sharp\nsimultaneous trade-offs for black and black-white pebbling for various\nparameter settings. Both of our contributions have been instrumental in\nobtaining the time-space trade-off results for resolution-based proof systems\nin [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2009].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 23:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 02:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We find that\nlarge-scale motions of cluster gas disrupt the AGN jets, causing energy to be\ndistributed throughout the centre of the cluster, rather than confined to a\nnarrow angle around the jet axis. Disruption of the jet also leads to the\nappearance of multiple disconnected X-ray bubbles from a long-duration AGN with\na constant luminosity. This implies that observations of multiple bubbles in a\ncluster are not necessarily an expression of the AGN duty cycle. We find that\nthe \"sphere of influence\" of the AGN, the radial scale within which the cluster\nis strongly affected by the jet, scales as R ~ L_jet^(1/3). Increasing the\nduration of AGN activity does not increase the radius affected by the AGN\nsignificantly, but does change the magnitude of the AGN's effects. How an AGN\ndelivers energy to a cluster will determine where that energy is deposited: a\nhigh luminosity is needed to heat material outside the core of the cluster,\nwhile a low-luminosity, long-duration AGN is more efficient at heating the\ninner few tens of kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 23:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2010 05:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Simultaneous\nU-band photometric and 3350A-9260A spectroscopic observations were obtained\nduring 1.3 hours of the flare decay. The event persisted for more than 7 hours\nand at flare peak, the U-band flux was almost 6 magnitudes brighter than in the\nquiescent state. The properties of this flare mark it as one of the most\nenergetic and longest-lasting white light flares ever to be observed on an\nisolated low-mass star. We present the U-band flare energetics and a flare\ncontinuum analysis. For the first time, we show convincingly with spectra that\nthe shape of the blue continuum from 3350A to 4800A can be represented as a sum\nof two components: a Balmer continuum as predicted by the Allred et al\nradiative hydrodynamic flare models and a T ~ 10,000K blackbody emission\ncomponent as suggested by many previous studies of the broadband colors and\nspectral distributions of flares. The areal coverage of the Balmer continuum\nand blackbody emission regions vary during the flare decay, with the Balmer\ncontinuum emitting region always being significantly (~3-16 times) larger.\nThese data will provide critical constraints for understanding the physics\nunderlying the mysterious blue continuum radiation in stellar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 01:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

Hierarchical modular\nnetworks were previously found to show a wider parameter range for LSA than\nrandom or small-world networks not possessing hierarchical organization or\nmultiple modules.

For constant edge density, only few network configurations,\npossessing an intermediate number of levels and a large number of modules, led\nto a large range of LSA independent of brain size. For a constant number of\nnode connections, there was a trend for optimal configurations in larger-size\nnetworks to possess a larger number of hierarchical levels or more modules.\nThese results may help to explain the trend to greater network complexity\napparent in larger brains and may indicate that this complexity is required for\nmaintaining stable levels of neural activation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 05:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}

The locus of the maximum of\n\\times4(t), when plotted against the time t* of maximum, exhibits a sharp peak\nprecisely at the temperature where the static response functions (specific\nheat, isothermal compressibility) also show similar sharp, divergent-like,\npeak. While the decay of population fluctuation time correlation function of\nboth 4- and 5- coordinated species slows down dramatically and a step-like\nfeature of the relaxation becomes evident, the lifetime itself of 5-corrdinated\nspecies remains short. These results suggest a new molecular mechanism of low\ntemperature anomalies and of the liquid-liquid transition in terms of\ninitiation, growth and termination of propagating jump and inter-conversion\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 07:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-17"}

I study the\nkinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those\nof counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy\ngalaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line,\nintermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV\nmorphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used\nat higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the\nframe of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field\nspectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q\nparameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar\nphases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is\n20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent\nwith Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show\nlarge-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the\ncontribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump\nformation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2,\nwhich could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical\nimages of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which\nthe stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former\ncorrespond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass\ndistribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation\nrelies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where\nclumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be\nsignificant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly\nsuppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy\ngalaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that\ninteractions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of\nclumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains\nmore uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also\nargue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is\nlarge enough so that every z~2 galaxy might be the result of a merger that\noccurred within their past 1 Gyr. I conclude that it is premature to rule out\nmergers as a universal driver for galaxy evolution from z~2 down to z=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 10:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We have explored some qualitatively new features\nthat a perturbed Kerr metric induces in its geodesic orbits. Since a generic\nperturbed Kerr metric does not possess all the special symmetries of a Kerr\nmetric, the geodesic equations in the former case are described by a slightly\nnonintegrable Hamiltonian system. According to the Poincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff\ntheorem this causes the appearance of the so-called Birkhoff chains of islands\non the corresponding surfaces of section in between the anticipated KAM curves\nof the integrable Kerr case, whenever the intrinsic frequencies of the system\nare at resonance. The chains of islands are characterized by finite width, i.e.\nthere is a finite range of initial conditions that correspond to a particular\nresonance and consequently to a constant rational ratio of intrinsic\nfrequencies. Thus while the EMRI changes adiabatically by radiating energy and\nangular momentum, by monitoring the frequencies of a signal we can look for a\ntransient pattern, in the form of a plateau, in the evolution of their ratio.\nWe have shown that such a plateau is anticipated to be apparent in a quite\nlarge fraction of possible orbital characteristics if the central gravitating\nsource is not a Kerr black hole. Moreover the plateau in the ratio of\nfrequencies is expected to be more prominent at specific rational values that\ncorrespond to the strongest resonances.

The data were analyzed by means of a\nsimple analytical description of the general properties of molecular emission\nfrom the inner shells around the cool star. Numerical calculations of the\nexpected line profiles, taking into account the level population and radiative\ntransfer under such conditions, were also performed. Weak emission of 12CO\nJ=2-1 and J=1-0 was detected in R Aqr and CH Cyg; a good line profile of 12CO\nJ=2-1 in R Aqr was obtained. The intensities and profile shapes of the detected\nlines are compatible with emission coming from a very small shell around the\nMira-type star, with a radius comparable to or slightly smaller than the\ndistance to the hot dwarf companion, 10$^{14}$ - 2 10$^{14}$ cm. We argue that\nother possible explanations are improbable. This region probably shows\nproperties similar to those characteristic of the inner shells around standard\nAGB stars: outwards expansion at about 5 - 25 km/s, with a significant\nacceleration of the gas, temperatures decreasing with radius between about 1000\nand 500 K, and densities ~ 10$^9$ - 3 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Our model calculations\nare able to explain the asymmetric line shape observed in 12CO J=2-1 from R\nAqr, in which the relatively weaker red part of the profile would result from\nselfabsorption by the outer layers (in the presence of a velocity increase and\na temperature decrease with radius). The mass-loss rates are somewhat larger\nthan in standard AGB stars, as often happens for symbiotic systems. In R Aqr,\nwe find that the total mass of the CO emitting region is ~ 2 - 3 10$^{-5}$ Mo,\ncorresponding to M' ~ 5 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^{-5}$ Mo/yr, and compatible with\nresults obtained from dust emission. Taking into account other existing data on\nmolecular emission, we suggest that the small extent of the molecule-rich gas\nin symbiotic systems is mainly due to molecule photodissociation by the\nradiation of the hot dwarf star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 12:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We address the excitation of the complex molecule\nHC3N to determine whether its unusually luminous emission is related to the\nnature of the buried nuclear source. We use IRAM 30m and JCMT observations of\nrotational and vibrational lines of HC3N to model the excitation of the\nmolecule by means of rotational diagrams. We report the first confirmed\nextragalactic detection of vibrational lines of HC3N. We detect 6 different\nrotational transitions ranging from J=10-9 to J=30-29 in the ground vibrational\nstate and obtain a tentative detection of the J=38-37 line. We also detect 7\nrotational transitions of the vibrationally excited states v6 and v7, with\nangular momenta ranging from J=10-9 to 28-27. The energies of the upper states\nof the observed transitions range from 20 to 850 K. In the optically thin\nregime, we find that the rotational transitions of the vibrational ground state\ncan be fitted for two temperatures, 30 K and 260 K, while the vibrationally\nexcited levels can be fitted for a rotational temperature of 90 K and a\nvibrational temperature of 500 K. In the inner 300 pc of NGC 4418, we estimate\na high HC3N abundance, of the order of 10^-7. The excitation of the HC3N\nmolecule responds strongly to the intense radiation field and the presence of\nwarm, dense gas and dust at the center of NGC 4418. The intense HC3N line\nemission is a result of both high abundances and excitation. The properties of\nthe HC3N emitting gas are similar to those found for hot cores in Sgr B2, which\nimplies that the nucleus (< 300 pc) of NGC 4418 is reminiscent of a hot core.\nThe potential presence of a compact, hot component (T=500 K) is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 13:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 10:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2010 15:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In addition, we find that the first-order phase boundary in this\nsoftened model ends in a finite-temperature dynamical critical point, which we\nexpect to be present in natural systems. We discuss links between this critical\npoint and quantum phase transitions, showing that dynamical phase transitions\nin $d$ dimensions map to quantum transitions in the same dimension, and hence\nto classical thermodynamic phase transitions in $d+1$ dimensions. We make these\nlinks explicit through exact mappings between master operators, transfer\nmatrices, and Hamiltonians for quantum spin chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 15:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

Yet, without proper mechanisms to ensure\ncooperation, the evolutionary pressure to maximize individual success tends to\ncreate a tragedy of the commons (such as over-fishing or the destruction of our\nenvironment). This contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of human\nbehavior with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has been\nsuccessfully used to explain the behavior of other biological species many\ntimes, from bacteria to vertebrates. Our agent-based model distinguishes\nindividuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperative\nindividuals (\"defectors\"), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishment\nefforts (called \"cooperators\" or \"second-order free-riders\"), cooperators who\npunish non-cooperative behavior (\"moralists\"), and defectors, who punish other\ndefectors despite being non-cooperative themselves (\"immoralists\"). By\nconsidering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model\nreveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate\ncooperators. This spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation of\nbehavioral strategies and solves the \"second-order free-rider problem\". Second,\nthe system behavior changes its character significantly even after very long\ntimes (\"who laughs last laughs best effect\"). Third, the presence of a number\nof defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing\ncooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists\nin a way that appears like an \"unholy collaboration\". Our findings suggest that\nthe consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the\nestablishment and spreading of \"moral behavior\" by means of game-theoretical\nconcepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches\nare powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical\nconcepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes\nunderstandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different\nbehavioral strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 15:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-03"}
