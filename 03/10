A Hopf monad is\na bimonad (or opmonoidal monad) whose fusion operators are invertible.

On a monoidal category with\ninternal Homs, a Hopf monad is a bimonad admitting a left and a right antipode.\nHopf monads generalize Hopf algebras to the non-braided setting. They also\ngeneralize Hopf algebroids (which are linear Hopf monads on a category of\nbimodules admitting a right adjoint). We show that any finite tensor category\nis the category of finite-dimensional modules over a Hopf algebroid. Any Hopf\nalgebra in the center of a monoidal category C gives rise to a Hopf monad on C.\nThe Hopf monads so obtained are exactly the augmented Hopf monads.

Several observations of this asteroid have been so far\nperformed, but its surface composition and nature are still a matter of debate.\nFor long time Lutetia was supposed to have a metallic nature due to its high\nIRAS albedo. Later on it has been suggested to have a surface composition\nsimilar to primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, while further\nobservations proposed a possible genetic link with more evolved enstatite\nchondrite meteorites. AIMS: In order to give an important contribution in\nsolving the conundrum of the nature of Lutetia, in November 2008 we performed\nvisible spectroscopic observations of this asteroid at the Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). METHODS: Thirteen visible spectra have been\nacquired at different rotational phases. RESULTS: We confirm the presence of a\nnarrow spectral feature at about 0.47-0.48 micron already found by Lazzarin et\nal. (2009) on the spectra of Lutetia. We also find a spectral feature at about\n0.6 micron, detected by Lazzarin et al. (2004) on one of their Lutetia's\nspectra. More importantly, our spectra exhibit different spectral slopes\nbetween 0.6 and 0.75 micron and, in particular, we found that up to 20% of the\nLutetia surface could have flatter spectra. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a\nvariation of the spectral slopes at different rotational phases that could be\ninterpreted as possibly due to differences in the chemical/mineralogical\ncomposition, as well as to inhomogeneities of the structure of the Lutetia's\nsurface (e.g., the presence of craters or albedo spots) in the southern\nhemisphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 16:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 19:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

However with the recent advances in short read\nsequencing technology, de Bruijn graph based algorithms seem to play a vital\nrole in practice.\n  Efficient algorithms for building these massive de Bruijn graphs are very\nessential in large sequencing projects based on short reads.

Based on\nthe calculated non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in momentum space, the\nscattering effects on both the non-differential (for a fixed dc field) and\ndifferential (for a fixed temperature) mobilities of electrons as functions of\ntemperature and dc field were demonstrated. The non-differential mobility of\nelectrons is switched from a linearly increasing function of temperature to a\nparabolic-like temperature dependence as the quantum wire is tuned from an\nimpurity-dominated system to a phonon-dominated one [see T. Fang, {\\em et al.},\n\\prb {\\bf 78}, 205403 (2008)]. In addition, a maximum has been obtained in the\ndc-field dependence of the differential mobility of electrons.

This perturbs each fluid element, raising\nthe local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium, inducing\nreactions that release heat (rotochemical heating). This effect has previously\nbeen studied by Fern\\'andez and Reisenegger for neutron stars of non-superfluid\nmatter and by Petrovich and Reisenegger for superfluid matter, finding that the\nsystem in both cases reaches a quasi-steady state, corresponding to a partial\nequilibration between compression, due to the loss of angular momentum, and\nreactions that try to restore the equilibrium. However, Petrovich and\nReisenegger assumes a constant value of the superfluid energy gap, whereas\ntheoretical models predict density-dependent gap amplitudes, and therefore gaps\nthat depend on the location in the star.

We confirm that some of these\nmassive objects are extremely compact with measured effective radii between\n0.\"1 - 0.\"2, giving sizes which are < 2 kpc, a factor of ~ 7 smaller in\neffective radii than similar mass galaxies today. Examining stellar mass\nsurface densities as a function of fixed physical aperture, we find an\nover-density of material within the inner profiles, and an under-density in the\nouter profile, within these high-z galaxies compared with similar mass galaxies\nin the local universe. Consequently, massive galaxies should evolve in a way to\ndecrease the stellar mass density in their inner region, and at the same time\ncreating more extensive outer light envelopes. We furthermore show that ~ 38%\n+- 20% of our sample contains evidence for a disturbed outer stellar matter\ndistribution suggesting that these galaxies are undergoing a recent dynamical\nepisode, such as a merger or accretion event.

Our main results are that LFs show a steepening faint end for early\ntype galaxies as a function of group mass/ multiplicity, with a much suppressed\ntrend (evident only in high mass groups) for late type galaxies. Variations\nbetween LFs as a function of group mass are robust irrespective of which\ngrouping catalogue is used, and broadly speaking what method for determining\ngroup `mass' is used. We find in particular that there is a significant deficit\nof low-mass passive galaxies in low multiplicity groups, as seen in high\nredshift clusters.

In 2001 and 2002, optical photometric and spectroscopic observations\nrevealed that HM Cnc is a very blue object with no intrinsic absorptions but\nbroad (FWHM 1500 km s^-1) low equivalent width emission lines (EW 1-6A), which\nwere first identified with the HeII Pickering series. The combination of X-ray\nand optical observations pictures HM Cnc as a double degenerate binary hosting\ntwo white dwarfs, and possibly being the shortest orbital period binary\ndiscovered so far. The present work is aimed at studying the orbital motion of\nthe two components by following the variations of the shape, centroid and\nintensity of the emission lines through the orbit. In February 2007, we carried\nout the first phase resolved optical spectroscopic study with the VLT/FORS2 in\nthe High Time Resolution (HIT) mode, yielding five phase bins in the 321 s\nmodulation. Despite the low SNR, the data show that the intensity of the three\nmost prominent emission lines, already detected in 2001, varies with the phase.\nThese lines are detected at phases 0.2-0.6 where the optical emission peaks,\nand marginally detected or not detected at all elsewhere. Moreover, the FWHM of\nthe emission lines in the phase resolved spectra is smaller, by almost a factor\n2, than that in the the phase-averaged 2001 spectrum. Our results are\nconsistent with both the pulsed optical component and emission lines\noriginating in the same region which we identify with the irradiated surface of\nthe secondary. Moreover, regardless of the origin of the un-pulsed optical\ncontinuum, we note that the EWs of the emission lines might be up to -15 /\n-25A, larger than thought before; these values are more similar to those\ndetected in cataclysmic variables. All the findings further confirm that the\n321s modulation observed in HM Cnc is the orbital period of the system, the\nshortest known to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 21:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-11"}

The role of negative\nfeedbacks in stability of living objects is main of those reasons. In\nKauffman's approach regulation using negative feedbacks is not considered\nsufficiently, e.g. in gene regulatory model based on Boolean networks, which\nindicates therefore not proper source of stability. Large damage avalanche is\navailable only in chaotic phase. It models death in all living objects\nnecessary for Darwinian elimination. It is the first step of my approach\nleading to structural tendencies which are effects of adaptive evolution of\ndynamic complex (maturely chaotic) networks. 2- Introduction of s>=2 equally\nprobable variants of signal (state of node in Kauffman network) as\ninterpretively based new statistical mechanism (RSN) instead of the bias p -\nprobability of one of signal variants used in RBN family and RNS. It is also\ndifferent than RWN model. For this mechanism which can be treated as very\nfrequent, ordered phase occurs only in exceptional cases but for this approach\nthe chaotic phase is investigated. Annealed approximation expectations and\nsimulations of damage spreading for different network types (similar to CRBN,\nFSRBN and EFRBN but with s>=2) are described. Degree of order in chaotic phase\nin dependency of network parameters and type is discussed. By using such order\nlife evolve. 3- A simplified algorithm called `reversed-annealed' for\nstatistical simulation of damage spreading is described.

The flight maneuvers are defined by a\nconcatenation of flight modes or primitives, each of which is achieved by a\nnonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical\nmodel of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration\nspace $\\SE$, is introduced as a basis for the analysis. The quadrotor UAV has\nfour input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts;\neach flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem.\nAlthough many flight modes can be studied, we focus on three output tracking\nproblems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given\nby the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output\ngiven by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A\nnonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group $\\SE$\nfor each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed\nloop properties that are almost global in each case.

Here we\nconsider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and\n\\pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base\npairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the\nwhole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA\nstructures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of\ninterest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze\ntheir induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding\nalgorithms, {\\tt RNAinverse}, {\\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\\tt INFO-RNA} are\nlimited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse\nfolding algorithm {\\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical\npseudoknot structures.\n  Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\\tt Inv}.

Application of\npressure is found to modify the previously reported magnetic structure,\nobserved under ambient conditions, in these compounds [I. Dhiman et al., Phys.\nRev. B 77, 094440 (2008)]. In x = 0.1 composition, at 4.6(2) GPa and beyond,\nA-type antiferromagnetic structure is found to coexist with CE-type\nantiferromagnetic phase, observed at ambient pressure, with TN ~ 150 K. For x =\n0.3 sample, as a function of pressure the CE-type phase is fully suppressed at\n2.3(1) GPa and A-type antiferromagnetic phase is favored. Further Sr doping at\nx = 0.4, the A-type antiferromagnetic phase is observed at ambient pressure and\nfor T < TN (~ 250K). This phase is retained in the studied pressure range.\nHowever, the magnetic moment progressively reduces with increasing pressure,\nindicating the suppression of A-type antiferromagnetic phase. The present study\nbrings out the fragile nature of the CE-type antiferromagnetic state in half\ndoped manganites as a function of pressure and disorder \\sigma 2. We observe\nthat pressure required for destabilizing the CE-type antiferromagnetic state is\nreduced with increasing disorder \\sigma 2. External pressure and changing\nA-site ionic radii have analogous effect on the magnetic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 06:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The object, then, entered an active state during which we observed\nshort flares having a timescale of 3-10 d. The object showed two types of\nfeatures in the color-magnitude relationship. One is a \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrend in the outburst state, and the other is a \"redder-when-brighter\" trend in\nthe faint state. These two types of features suggest a contribution of a\nthermal emission to the observed flux, as suspected in previous studies. Our\npolarimetric observation detected two episodes of the rotation of the\npolarization vector. The first one was a counterclockwise rotation in the $QU$\nplane during the outburst state. After this rotation event of the polarization\nvector, the object entered a rapidly fading stage. The second one was seen in a\nseries of flares during the active state. Each flare had a specific position\nangle of polarization, and it apparently rotated clockwise from the first to\nthe last flares. Thus, the object exhibited rotations of the polarization\nvector in opposite directions. We estimated a decay timescale of the short\nflares during the active state, and then calculated an upper limit of the\nstrength of the magnetic field, $B$=0.2 G, assuming a typical beaming factor of\nblazars, $\\delta=20$.

The evolution of each mass in the HR diagram occurs\nalong vertical tracks that, when the core helium is consumed, evolve to higher\nTeff and then to the white dwarf stage. The larger is the mass, the smaller is\nthe Teff of the models, so that the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is\n\"horizontal\". In this paper we show that, if the helium mass fraction (Y) of\nthe envelope is larger than Y~0.5, the shape of the tracks changes completely:\nthe hydrogen burning becomes efficient again also for very small envelope\nmasses, thanks to the higher molecular weight and to the higher temperatures of\nthe hydrogen shell. The larger is Y, the smaller is the envelope mass that\nprovides strong H-shell burning. These tracks have a curled shape, are located\nat a Teff following the approximate relation Teff=8090+ 32900xY, and become\nmore luminous for larger envelope masses. Consequently, the ZAHB of the very\nhigh helium models is \"vertical\" in the HR diagram. Synthetic models based on\nthese tracks nicely reproduce the location and shape of the \"blue hook\" in the\nglobular cluster wCen, best fit by a very high Teff (bluer) sequence with\nY=0.80 and a cooler (redder) one with Y=0.65. Although these precise values of\nY may depend on the color-Teff conversions, we know that the helium content of\nthe progenitors of the blue hook stars can not be larger than Y~0.38-0.40, if\nthey are descendants of the cluster blue main sequence. Consequently, this\ninterpretation implies that all these objects must in fact be progeny of the\nblue main sequence, but they have all suffered further deep mixing, that has\nlargely and uniformly increased their surface helium abundance, during the red\ngiant branch evolution. A late helium flash can not be the cause of this deep\nmixing, as the models we propose have hydrogen rich envelopes much more massive\nthan those required for a late flash. We discuss different models of deep\nmixing proposed in the literature, and conclude that our interpretation of the\nblue hook can not be ruled out, but requires a much deeper investigation before\nit can be accepted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 09:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the\nequation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of\nan ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the\nrelativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the\ncondition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas\nparticle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type\nenergy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of\nthe relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann\nform in the classical limit.\n  The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's\nsurface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's\nphysical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the\ninternal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer\nincreases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the\nquestion if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems\nto be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or,\nso far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a\ndistant observer.\n  In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form\nof the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the\nRETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional\nform. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate\nidentity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its\ngravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the\ninfinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed\nobject.

These observations have been performed in 2006 and 2008, in\nthe J, H and Ks bands. We found no candidate infrared counterpart to RRAT\nJ1317-5759, down to a limiting magnitude of Ks ~ 21. On the other hand, we\nfound a possible candidate counterpart for RRAT J1819-1458, having a magnitude\nof Ks=20.96+/-0.10 . In particular, this is the only source within a 1 sigma\nerror circle around the source's accurate X-ray position, although given the\ncrowded field we cannot exclude that this is due to a chance coincidence. The\ninfrared flux of the putative counterpart to the highly magnetic RRAT\nJ1819-1458, is higher than expected from a normal radio pulsar, but consistent\nwith that seen from magnetars. We also searched for the near-infrared\ncounterpart to the X-ray diffuse emission recently discovered around RRAT\nJ1819-1458, but we did not detect this component in the near-infrared band.

It is observed that the reversals of\nthe LSC are induced by its reorientation along the azimuthal direction, which\nare quantified using the phases of the first Fourier mode of the vertical\nvelocity measured near the lateral surface in the mid plane. During a\n``complete reversal'', the above phase changes by around $180^0$ leading to\nreversals of the vertical velocity at all the probes. On the contrary, the\nvertical velocity reverses only at some of the probes during a ``partial\nreversal'' with phase change other than $180^0$. Numerically we observe\nrotation-led and cessation-led reorientations, in agreement with earlier\nexperimental results. The ratio of the amplitude of the second Fourier mode and\nthe first Fourier mode rises sharply during the cessation-led reorientations.\nThis observation is consistent with the quadrupolar dominant temperature\nprofile observed during the cessations. We also observe reorientations\ninvolving double cessation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 13:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 19:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 14:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 08:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-14"}

In many systems the qubits are naturally\ncoupled, but such an always-on interaction limits the algorithms that may be\nimplemented. Coupling interactions may also be directed in devices and circuits\nthat are provided with additional control wiring. This can be achieved by\nadjusting the gate voltage in a semiconductor device or an additional flux in a\nsuperconducting device. Such control signals must be applied adiabatically\n(limiting the speed) and the additional wiring provides pathways for noise,\nwhich leads to decoherence. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach to\ncoupling by exploiting the nonlinear behaviour of a degenerately doped silicon\ntransistor. A single transistor can exhibit a large number of individual\nresonances, which are seen as changes in the source-drain current of a\ndc-biased device. These resonances may be addressed in frequency space due to\ntheir high quality factors. Two widely separated resonances are addressed and\ncoupled in three-frequency spectroscopy by ensuring that the third frequency\ncorresponds to the difference between the two individual resonances. The\nnonlinearity causes the generation of additional driving signals with\nappropriate frequency and phase relationships to ensure coupling, resulting in\nadditional spectroscopic features that could be exploited for rapid state\nmanipulation and gate operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 14:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In Lykawka et\nal. (2009), we performed extensive dynamical simulations, including planetary\nmigration, to investigate the origin of the Neptunian Trojan population.\nUtilising the vast amount of simulation data obtained for that work, together\nwith fresh results from new simulations, we here investigate the dynamical\ncapture of Trojans by all four giant planets from a primordial trans-Neptunian\ndisk. We find the likelihood of a given planetesimal from this region being\ncaptured onto an orbit within Jupiter's Trojan cloud lies between several times\n10^-6 and 10^-5. For Saturn, the probability is found to be in the range <10^-6\nto 10^-5, whilst for Uranus the probabilities range between 10^-5 and 10^-4.\nFinally, Neptune displays the greatest probability of Trojan capture, with\nvalues ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-3. Our results suggest that all four giant\nplanets are able to capture and retain a significant population of Trojan\nobjects from the disk by the end of planetary migration. As a result of\nencounters with the giant planets prior to Trojan capture, these objects tend\nto be captured on orbits that are spread over a wide range of orbital\neccentricities and inclinations. The bulk of captured objects are to some\nextent dynamically unstable, and therefore the populations of these objects\ntend to decay over the age of the Solar System, providing an important ongoing\nsource of new objects moving on dynamically unstable orbits among the giant\nplanets. Given that a huge population of objects would be displaced by\nNeptune's outward migration (with a potential cumulative mass a number of times\nthat of the Earth), we conclude that the surviving remnant of the Trojans\ncaptured during the migration of the outer planets might be sufficient to\nexplain the currently known Trojan populations in the outer Solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 15:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-11"}
