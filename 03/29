The isovalent\nsubstitution of Fe by Ru leads to an increase of the a parameter and a decrease\nof the c parameter, resulting in a strong increase of the AsFeAs angle and a\ndecrease of the As height above the Fe planes. Upon Ru substitution, the\nmagnetic order is progressively suppressed and superconductivity emerges for x\n> 0.15, with an optimal Tc ~ 20K at x = 0.35 and coexistence of magnetism and\nsuperconductivity between these two Ru contents. Moreover, the Hall coefficient\nRH which is always negative and decreases with temperature in BaFe2As2, is\nfound to increase here with decreasing T and even change sign for x > 0.15. For\nx_Ru = 0.35, photo-emission studies have shown that the number of holes and\nelectrons are similar with n_e = n_h ~ 0.11, that is twice larger than found in\nBaFe2As2 [1]. Using this estimate, we find that the transport properties of\nBa(Fe_0.65Ru_0.35)_2As_2 can be accounted for by the conventional multiband\ndescription for a compensated semi-metal. In particular, our results show that\nthe mobility of holes is strongly enhanced upon Ru addition and overcomes that\nof electrons at low temperature when x_Ru > 0.15.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2010 16:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 13:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-07"}

This makes large populations more likely to get trapped at local fitness\npeaks and implies an advantage of small populations at intermediate time\nscales. The range of population sizes where this effect is operative coincides\nwith the onset of clonal interference. Additional studies using ensembles of\nrandom fitness landscapes show that the results achieved for a particular\nchoice of three-locus landscape parameters are robust and also persist as the\nnumber of loci increases.\n  Conclusions: Our study indicates that an advantage for small populations is\nlikely whenever the fitness landscape contains local maxima.

We conclude\nwith the difficulty we encounter in this model and possible way to solve them\nwithout resorting to a phenomenological method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2010 20:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 20:47:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2011 00:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Routing of data in VANETs is a challenging task due to rapidly\nchanging topology and high speed mobility of vehicles. Position based routing\nprotocols are becoming popular due to advancement and availability of GPS\ndevices. One of the critical issues of VANETs are frequent path disruptions\ncaused by high speed mobility of vehicle that leads to broken links which\nresults in low throughput and high overhead . This paper argues the use of\ninformation on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, speed\nof vehicles) to predict a possible link-breakage event prior to its occurrence.\nSo in this paper we propose a Reliable Directional Greedy routing (RDGR), a\nreliable position based routing approach which obtains position, speed and\ndirection of its neighboring nodes from GPS. This approach incorporates\npotential score based strategy, which calculates link stability between\nneighbor nodes in distributed fashion for reliable forwarding of data packet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 06:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

The unique behaviour of the MOS transistors in subthreshold\nregion not only allows a designer to work at low input bias current but also at\nlow voltage. While operating the device at weak inversion results low power\ndissipation but dynamic range is degraded. Optimum balance between power\ndissipation and dynamic range results when the MOS transistors are operated at\nmoderate inversion. Power is again minimised by the application of input\ndependant bias current using feedback loops in the input transistors of the\ndifferential pair with two current substractors. In comparison with the\nreported low power low voltage opamps at 0.8 micron technology, this opamp has\nvery low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operates\nat low voltage. The opamp is fairly small (0.0084 mm 2) and slew rate is more\nthan other low power low voltage opamps reported at 0.8 um technology [1,2].\nVittoz at al [3] reported that slew rate can be improved by adaptive biasing\ntechnique and power dissipation can be reduced by operating the device in weak\ninversion. Though lower power dissipation is achieved the area required by the\ncircuit is very large and speed is too small. So, operating the device in\nmoderate inversion is a good solution. Also operating the device in\nsubthreshold region not only allows lower power dissipation but also a lower\nvoltage operation is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 07:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

The interplay of these parameters at\ndifferent redshifts will substantially affect the evolution of galaxies and, as\na consequence, the evolution of them will provide important clues and\nconstraints on the galaxy evolution models. In this work we focus on the\nevolution of the SFR, metallicity of the gas, and morphology of galaxies at low\nredshift in search of signs of evolution. We use the S2N2 diagnostic diagram as\na tool to classify star--forming, composite, and AGN galaxies. We analyzed the\nevolution of the three principal BPT diagrams, estimating the SFR and specific\nSFR (SSFR) for our samples of galaxies, studying the luminosity and\nmass-metallicity relations, and analyzing the morphology of our sample of\ngalaxies through the g-r color, concentration index, and SSFR. We found that\nthe S2N2 is a reliable diagram to classify star--forming, composite, and AGNs\ngalaxies. We demonstrate that the three principal BPT diagrams show an\nevolution toward higher values of [OIII]5007/Hb due to a metallicity decrement.\nWe found an evolution in the mass-metallicity relation of ~ 0.2 dex for the\nredshift range 0.3 < z < 0.4 compared to our local one. From the analysis of\nthe evolution of the SFR and SSFR as a function of the stellar mass and\nmetallicity, we discovered a group of galaxies with higher SFR and SSFR at all\nredshift samples, whose morphology is consistent with those of late-type\ngalaxies. Finally, the comparison of our local (0.04<z<0.1) with our higher\nredshift sample (0.3<z<0.4), show that the metallicity, the SFR and morphology,\nevolve toward lower values of metallicity, higher SFRs, and late--type\nmorphologies for the redshift range 0.3<z<0.4\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 09:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

But both structures,\ngeometry and smoothness, are independent of each other. In this paper we\ncalculate the \"smoothness structure\" part of the path integral in quantum\ngravity assuming that the \"sum over geometries\" is already given.

In\naddition to this lack of observational evidence for a relation between black\nhole spin and jet properties in stellar mass black holes, we highlight the fact\nthat there appear to be at least three different ways in which the jet power\nand/or radiative efficiency from a black hole X-ray binary may vary, two of\nwhich are certainly independent of spin because they occur in the same source\non relatively short timescales, and the third which does not correlate with any\nreported measurements of black hole spin.

Using backward induction, we are\nable to completely characterize the game's equilibria.

Moreover, two operators always choose the same equilibrium\nprice despite their difference in leasing costs. Each user receives the same\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the equilibrium, and the obtained payoff is\nlinear in its transmission power and channel gain. We also compare the duopoly\nequilibrium with the coordinated case where two operators cooperate to maximize\ntheir total profit.

Here, we first show theoretically that if the medium\nis resistive, the frequency scaling should be the same for electroencephalogram\n(EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals at low frequencies (<10 Hz). To\ntest this prediction, we analyzed the spectrum of simultaneous EEG and MEG\nmeasurements in four human subjects. The frequency scaling of EEG displays\ncoherent variations across the brain, in general between 1/f and 1/f^2, and\ntends to be smaller in parietal/temporal regions. In a given region, although\nthe variability of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for MEG compared\nto EEG, both signals consistently scale with a different exponent. In some\ncases, the scaling was similar, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio of the\nMEG was low. Several methods of noise correction for environmental and\ninstrumental noise were tested, and they all increased the difference between\nEEG and MEG scaling. In conclusion, there is a significant difference in\nfrequency scaling between EEG and MEG, which can be explained if the\nextracellular medium (including other layers such as dura matter and skull) is\nglobally non-resistive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 13:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 09:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The three planet model is\nfound to be 10^5 times more probable than the next most probable model which is\na two planet model. The nonlinear model fitting is accomplished with a new\nhybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (HMCMC) algorithm which incorporates parallel\ntempering, simulated annealing and genetic crossover operations. Each of these\nfeatures facilitate the detection of a global minimum in chi-squared. By\ncombining all three, the HMCMC greatly increases the probability of realizing\nthis goal.

In this paper an explicit formula for\nthe $L^2$ metric on of $\\h_{d,k}(\\Sigma)$ in the special case $d=1$ and\n$\\Sigma=S^2$ is computed. Essential use is made of the k\\\"ahler property of the\n$L^2$ metric, and its invariance under a natural action of $G=U(k+1)\\times\nU(2)$. It is shown that {\\em all} $G$-invariant k\\\"ahler metrics on\n$\\h_{1,k}(S^2)$ have finite volume for $k\\geq 2$. The volume of $\\h_{1,k}(S^2)$\nwith respect to the $L^2$ metric is computed explicitly and is shown to agree\nwith a general formula for $\\h_{d,k}(\\Sigma)$ recently conjectured by Baptista.\nThe area of a family of twice punctured spheres in $\\h_{d,k}(\\Sigma)$ is\ncomputed exactly, and a formal argument is presented in support of Baptista's\nformula for $\\h_{d,k}(S^2)$ for all $d$, $k$, and $\\h_{2,1}(T^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 14:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

In most\nvertebrates the active process stems from the active motility of hair bundles.\nThe mammalian cochlea exhibits an additional form of mechanical activity termed\nelectromotility: its outer hair cells (OHCs) change length upon electrical\nstimulation. The relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the active\nprocess in the mammalian inner ear is the subject of intense current debate.\nHere we show that active hair-bundle motility and electromotility can together\nimplement an efficient mechanism for amplification that functions like a\nratchet: sound-evoked forces acting on the basilar membrane are transmitted to\nthe hair bundles whereas electromotility decouples active hair-bundle forces\nfrom the basilar membrane. This unidirectional coupling can extend the hearing\nrange well below the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane. It thereby\nprovides a concept for low-frequency hearing that accounts for a variety of\nunexplained experimental observations from the cochlear apex, including the\nshape and phase behavior of apical tuning curves, their lack of significant\nnonlinearities, and the shape changes of threshold tuning curves of auditory\nnerve fibers along the cochlea. The ratchet mechanism constitutes a general\ndesign principle for implementing mechanical amplification in engineering\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 14:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-30"}

Here, we investigate TiO2 (rutile) containing 1 - 5% of iron\ncations and find that the room-temperature ferromagnetism of films prepared by\npulsed-laser deposition is not due to magnetic ordering of the iron. The films\nare neither dilute magnetic semiconductors nor hosts to an iron-based\nferromagnetic impurity phase. A new model is developed for defect-related\nferromagnetism which involves a spin-split defect band populated by charge\ntransfer from a proximate charge reservoir in the present case a mixture Fe2+\nand Fe3+ ions in the oxide lattice. The phase diagram for the model shows how\ninhomogeneous Stoner ferromagnetism depends on the total number of electrons\nNtot, the Stoner exchange integral I and the defect bandwidth W; the band\noccupancy is governed by the d-d Coulomb interaction U. There are regions of\nferromagnetic metal, half-metal and insulator as well as nonmagnetic metal and\ninsulator. A characteristic feature of the high-temperature Stoner magnetism is\nan an anhysteretic magnetization curve which is practically temperature\nindependent below room temperature. This is related to a wandering\nferromagnetic axis which is determined by local dipole fields. The\nmagnetization is limited by the defect concentration, not by the 3d doping.\nOnly 1-2 % of the volume of the films is magnetically ordered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 14:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A robust understanding of the mechanisms that govern this\nsegmentation cascade is still lacking, and a new generation of quantitative\nmeasurements of the spatio-temporal concentration dynamics of the individual\nplayers of this cascade are necessary for further progress. Here we describe a\nseries of methods that are meant to represent a start of such a quantification\nusing Bcd as an example.

Generalization of these\nmethods to other genes in the Drosophila segmentation cascade is\nstraightforward and should further our understanding of the early patterning\nprocesses and the architecture of the underlying genetic network structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 15:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 13:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2010 13:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

The sequence of\nmatrices of the structural constants for this chain of evolution algebras\nsatisfies an analogue of Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. We give several examples\n(time homogenous, time non-homogenous, periodic, etc.) of such chains. For a\nperiodic chain of evolution algebras we construct a continuum set of\nnon-isomorphic evolution algebras and show that the corresponding discrete time\nchain of evolution algebras is dense in the set. We obtain a criteria for an\nevolution algebra to be baric and give a concept of a property transition. For\nseveral chains of evolution algebras we describe the behavior of the baric\nproperty depending on the time. For a chain of evolution algebras given by the\nmatrix of a two-state evolution we define a baric property controller function\nand under some conditions on this controller we prove that the chain is not\nbaric almost surely (with respect to Lebesgue measure). We also construct\nexamples of the almost surely baric chains of evolution algebras. We show that\nthere are chains of evolution algebras such that if it has a unique (resp.\ninfinitely many) absolute nilpotent element at a fixed time, then it has unique\n(resp. infinitely many) absolute nilpotent element any time; also there are\nchains of evolution algebras which have not such property. For an example of\ntwo dimensional chain of evolution algebras we give the full set of idempotent\nelements and show that for some values of parameters the number of idempotent\nelements does not depend on time, but for other values of parameters there is a\ncritical time $t_{c}$ such that the chain has only two idempotent elements if\ntime $t\\geq t_{\\rm c}$ and it has four idempotent elements if time $t< t_{\\rm\nc}$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 08:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2010 16:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2011 13:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-08"}

The underlying physical mechanism of generation of this unique\noptical curtain can be explained in both the spatial domain and the wave-vector\ndomain. In particular, in each period we use one metallic nanostrip to equate\nthe amplitudes of lights impinging on the openings of two metallic nanoslits\nand also shift their phases by pi difference. We elaborate the influence on the\noutput effect from some geometrical parameters like the periodicity, the slit\nheight and so on. By controlling the light illuminated on metallic\nsubwavelength apertures, it is practical to generate optical curtains of\narbitrary forms, which may open new routes of plasmonic nano-lithography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2010 15:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-31"}
