A secular perturbation from a distant stellar companion is a\nvery important mechanism in exciting planetary eccentricities, as many of the\nextrasolar planetary systems are associated with stellar companions. Although\nthe orbital evolution of an Earth-like planet in a stellar binary is well\nunderstood, the effect of a binary perturbation to a more realistic system\ncontaining additional gas giant planets has been very little studied. Here we\nprovide analytic criteria confirmed by a large ensemble of numerical\nintegrations that identify the initial orbital parameters leading to eccentric\norbits.

A central tool in systems\ntheory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control\nLyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting\nclosed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed,\npredefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired\nconverging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be\noverconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a\nstability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in\nterms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the\ndesign of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a\ncone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way\nnon-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that\ncan be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to\nclassical CLFs, which makes \\emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for\nstabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time\ncontrol. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible\nCLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods\nbelow one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 17:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-01"}

We present\nXMM-Newton observations of this object, which allowed the detection of the\npreviously invisible component of the binary core, whose existence was inferred\nso far only from radial velocity and photometric variations. The parameters of\nthe binary system were deduced from a wealth of information via three\nindependent routes using the spectral energy distribution (from the infrared to\nX-rays), the light and radial velocity curves, and a detailed model atmosphere\nfitting of the stellar absorption features of the optical/UV component.

In fact,\nwhen a collapsing Universe is reduced to a supermassive black hole of a small\nsize, a very strong field of the conjectured force may create\nparticle-antiparticle pairs from the surrounding vacuum. The amount of the\nantimatter created from the physical vacuum is equal to the decrease of mass of\n\"black hole Universe\" and violently repelled from it. When the size of the\nblack hole is sufficiently small the creation of antimatter may become so huge\nand fast, that matter of our Universe may disappear in a fraction of the Planck\ntime. So fast transformation of matter to antimatter may look like a Big Bang\nwith the initial size about 30 orders of magnitude greater than the Planck\nlength, questioning the need for inflation. In addition, a Big Crunch, of a\nUniverse dominated by matter, leads to a new Universe dominated by antimatter,\nand vice versa; without need to invoke CP violation as explanation of\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry. Simply, our present day Universe is dominated by\nmatter, because the previous Universe was dominated by antimatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 19:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 07:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-10"}

In\nthe model, the lobes inflated by low-power jets are assumed to expand in near\npressure-balance against the external medium. Both cases of constant external\npressure and decreasing external pressure are considered. Evolution of an\nindividual source is described by the power-size track. The source appears as\nits lobe is inflated and radio luminosity increases to above the detection\nlevel; the source then moves along the track and eventually disappears as its\nluminosity drops below the detection limit. The power-size tracks are\ncalculated including the combined energy losses due to synchrotron radiation,\nadiabatic expansion, and inverse Compton scattering. It is shown that in\ngeneral, the constant-pressure model predicts an excess number of luminous,\nsmall-size sources while underpredicting large-size sources in the power-size\ndiagram. The predicted spectra are steep for most sources, which is\ninconsistent with observations. By comparison, the pressure-limiting model fits\nobservations better. In this model, low-luminosity sources undergo substantial\nexpansion losses in the initial phase and as a result, it predicts fewer\nluminous, small-size sources. The resultant spectra are flat for most sources\nexcept for the oldest ones, which seems consistent with observations. The\npower-size tracks, in contrast to that of high-luminosity radio galaxies, are\ncharacterized by a slow increase in luminosity for most of the source's life,\nfollowed by a rapid decline when the synchrotron or inverse Compton scattering\nlosses set in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 00:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

However, at the depths probed by Stage III surveys (such as DES),\nlet alone Stage IV (LSST, JDEM, Euclid), existing large redshift samples have\nall been highly (25-60%) incomplete. A powerful alternative approach is to\nexploit the clustering of galaxies to perform photometric redshift\ncalibrations. Measuring the two-point angular cross-correlation between objects\nin some photometric redshift bin and objects with known spectroscopic redshift\nallows the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample to be\nreconstructed in detail, even if it includes objects too faint for spectroscopy\nor if spectroscopic samples are highly incomplete. We test this technique using\nmock DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift survey light cones constructed from the Millennium\nSimulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs. From this realistic test, we find\nthat the true redshift distribution of a photometric sample can, in fact, be\ndetermined accurately with cross-correlation techniques. We also compare the\nempirical error in the reconstruction of redshift distributions to previous\nanalytic predictions, finding that additional components must be included in\nerror budgets to match the simulation results. We conclude by presenting a\nstep-by-step, optimized recipe for reconstructing redshift distributions using\nstandard correlation measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2010 23:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 22:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-22"}

If the strongest\nMgII absorption-line systems detected in the spectra of background quasars\narise in such outflows, \"ultra-strong\" MgII (USMgII) absorbers would identify\nsignificant numbers of galactic winds over a huge baseline in cosmic time, in a\nmanner independent of the luminous properties of the galaxy. To this end, we\npresent the first detailed imaging and spectroscopic study of the fields of two\nUSMgII absorber systems culled from a statistical absorber catalog, with the\ngoal of understanding the physical processes leading to the large velocity\nspreads that define such systems. Each field contains two bright emission-line\ngalaxies at similar redshift (dv < 300 km/s) to that of the absorption.\nLower-limits on their instantaneous star formation rates (SFR) from the\nobserved OII and Hb line fluxes, and stellar masses from spectral template\nfitting indicate specific SFRs among the highest for their masses at z~0.7.\nAdditionally, their 4000A break and Balmer absorption strengths imply they have\nundergone recent (~0.01 - 1 Gyr) starbursts. The concomitant presence of two\nrare phenomena - starbursts and USMgII absorbers - strongly implies a causal\nconnection.

An achievable rate region is\nestablished for the secure discrete memoryless MAC. The secrecy sum capacity of\nthe degraded Gaussian MIMO MAC is proven using Gaussian codebooks. For the\nnon-degraded Gaussian MIMO MAC, an algorithm inspired by interference alignment\ntechnique is proposed to achieve the largest possible total\nSecure-Degrees-of-Freedom (S-DoF). When all the terminals are equipped with a\nsingle antenna, Gaussian codebooks have shown to be inefficient in providing a\npositive S-DoF. Instead, a novel secure coding scheme is proposed to achieve a\npositive S-DoF in the single antenna MAC. This scheme converts the\nsingle-antenna system into a multiple-dimension system with fractional\ndimensions. The achievability scheme is based on the alignment of signals into\na small sub-space at the eavesdropper, and the simultaneous separation of the\nsignals at the intended receiver. Tools from the field of Diophantine\nApproximation in number theory are used to analyze the probability of error in\nthe coding scheme.

When the hypotheses are independent, the\nBenjamini-Hochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-specified level.\nBy construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II\nerror. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including\nplug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of\nthe proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the\ndensity of the $p$-values, as the number $m$ of tested hypotheses grows to\ninfinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove\nthat these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a\ntighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader\nrange of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that\nthis increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric\nconvergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form $m^{-k/(2k+1)}$,\nwhere $k$ is determined by the regularity of the density of the $p$-value\ndistribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution. These\nresults are applied to one- and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and\nLaplace location models, and for the Student model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 08:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 08:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-04"}

We are able to derive the full\n6D phase-space coordinates for a large sample of RAVE stars. This method is\ntested with artificial data, Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes and\nobservations of the open cluster M67. Results: When we applied our method to a\nset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative\n(statistical) distance errors of < 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) have\nrelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively.

The typical specific star formation rates (SFR/M*) of SF galaxies in\ngroups are similar to those in the field across a wide range of stellar mass\n(M*>10^9.6 msun), favoring a quickly acting mechanism that suppresses star\nformation to explain the overall smaller fraction of SF galaxies in groups. If\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions are responsible, then the extremely low starburst\ngalaxy fraction (<1%) implies a short timescale (~0.1 Gyr) for any\nmerger-induced starburst stage. Comparison to two rich clusters shows that\nclusters contain a population of massive SF galaxies with very low SFR (14% of\nall the galaxies with M*>10^10 Msun), possibly as a consequence of ram pressure\nstripping being less efficient in removing gas from more massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 10:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

They are based on ideas of Weyl,\nEddington and Einstein and, in particular, on Einstein's proposal to specify\nthe space - time geometry by use of the Hamilton principle. More specifically,\nthe connection coefficients are derived by varying a `geometric' Lagrangian\nthat is supposed to be an arbitrary function of the generalized (non-symmetric)\nRicci curvature tensor (and, possibly, of other fundamental tensors) expressed\nin terms of the connection coefficients regarded as independent variables. In\naddition to the standard Einstein gravity, such a theory predicts dark energy\n(the cosmological constant, in the first approximation), a neutral massive (or,\ntachyonic) vector field, and massive (or, tachyonic) scalar fields. These\nfields couple only to gravity and may generate dark matter and/or inflation.\nThe masses (real or imaginary) have geometric origin and one cannot avoid their\nappearance in any concrete model. Further details of the theory - such as the\nnature of the vector and scalar fields that can describe massive particles,\ntachyons, or even `phantoms' - depend on the concrete choice of the geometric\nLagrangian.

To improve our estimate of the relative contribution of the AGN and\nSB emission to its total bolometric output, we have built broad band spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) for these HLIRGs, and we have fitted empirical AGN\nand SB templates to these SEDs. In broad terms, most sources are well fitted\nusing this method, and we found AGN and SB contributions similar to those\nobtained by previous studies of HLIRGs. We have classified the HLIRGs SEDs in\ntwo groups, named class A and class B. Class A HLIRGs show a flat SED from the\noptical to the infrared energy range. Three out of seven class A sources can be\nmodelled with a pure luminosity-dependent QSO template, while the rest of them\nrequire a type 1 AGN template and a SB template. The SB component is dominant\nin three out of four class A objects. Class B HLIRGs show SEDs with a prominent\nand broad IR bump. These sources can not trivially be modelled with a\ncombination of pure AGN and pure SB, they require templates of composite\nobjects, suggesting that >50% of their emission comes from stellar formation\nprocesses.

Although less expensive than physical\nexperimentation, computer codes can still be time-consuming to run. An\neffective strategy for exploring the response surface of the deterministic\nsimulator is the use of an approximation to the computer code, such as a\nGaussian process (GP) model, coupled with a sequential sampling strategy for\nchoosing design points that can be used to build the GP model. The ultimate\ngoal of such studies is often the estimation of specific features of interest\nof the simulator output, such as the maximum, minimum, or a level set\n(contour). Before approximating such features with the GP model, sufficient\nruns of the computer simulator must be completed.\n  Sequential designs with an expected improvement (EI) function can yield good\nestimates of the features with a minimal number of runs. The challenge is that\nthe expected improvement function itself is often multimodal and difficult to\nmaximize. We develop branch and bound algorithms for efficiently maximizing the\nEI function in specific problems, including the simultaneous estimation of a\nminimum and a maximum, and in the estimation of a contour. These branch and\nbound algorithms outperform other optimization strategies such as genetic\nalgorithms, and over a number of sequential design steps can lead to\ndramatically superior accuracy in estimation of features of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 13:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}

The aims of this study are to identify submillimeter\nsources in the field of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), a massive cluster of\ngalaxies at z~0.3, measure their flux densities at 870 micron, and search for\ncounterparts at other wavelengths to constrain their properties. We carried out\ndeep observations of the submillimeter continuum emission at 870 micron using\nthe Large APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment\n(APEX) telescope. Several numerical techniques were used to quantify the noise\nproperties of the data and extract sources. In total, seventeen sources were\nfound. Thirteen of them lie in the central 10 arcminutes of the map, which has\na pixel sensitivity of 1.2 mJy per 22 arcsec beam. After correction for flux\nboosting and gravitational lensing, the number counts are consistent with\npublished submm measurements. Nine of the sources have infrared counterparts in\nSpitzer maps. The strongest submm detection coincides with a source previously\nreported at other wavelengths, at an estimated redshift z~2.7. If the submm\nflux arises from two images of a galaxy magnified by a total factor of 75, as\nmodels have suggested, its intrinsic flux would be around 0.6 mJy, consistent\nwith an intrinsic luminosity below 10^12 L_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 15:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

As a local benchmark we use a couple of z ~ 0 VDFs\n(a Monte-Carlo realised VDF based on SDSS DR5 and a directly measured VDF based\non SDSS DR6). We then focus on connecting the VDF evolution to the HMF\nevolution predicted by N-body simulations and the SMF evolution constrained by\ngalaxy surveys. On the VDF-HMF connection, we find that the local dark halo\nvirial mass-central stellar velocity dispersion (Mvir-sigma) relation is in\ngood agreement with the individual properties of well-studied low-redshift dark\nhaloes, and the VDF evolution closely parallels the HMF evolution meaning\nlittle evolution in the Mvir-sigma relation.

First, we model\nthe observations with a dusty wind-blown bubble, and then ask whether dust\ncould survive within N49 to its present age (estimated to be 5x10^5 to 10^6\nyears). We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would\nimply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the\nwind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution. While more detailed models are certainly called for, this work\nillustrates the possible strong importance of dust in wind-blown bubbles, and\nis a first step toward models of dusty, wind-blown bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 15:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
