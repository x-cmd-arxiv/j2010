These measurements were\nperformed using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC). Nucleon-nucleus interactions were extracted from the d+Au data by\nidentifying the deuteron spectators. The deuteron spectators were measured\nusing two calorimeters; one that detected forward-going single neutrons and a\nnewly installed calorimeter that detected forward-going single protons. The\nlarge suppression of high-pT hadron production in central Au+Au interactions\nrelative to a naive superposition of p+pbar collisions has been interpreted as\nevidence of partonic energy loss in a dense medium. This interpretation is\nfounded upon the absence of such suppression in the yield of d+Au collisions.\nIt is shown that d+Au is indeed a valid reference system, as hadron production\nin d+Au agrees with a simple binary collision scaling of hadron production in\np+Au. An ideal reference for Au+Au collisions is constructed using a weighted\ncombination of p+Au and n+Au yields and is found to be similar to the d+Au\nreference. Further, hadron production in p+Au interactions is compared to that\nof n+Au interactions, in order to study the transport of charge from the\ninitial state to mid-rapidity. No asymmetry between the positively and\nnegatively charged hadron spectra of p+Au and n+Au interactions is observed for\nparticles having an average pseudo-rapidity of 0.8. A study of the Cronin\nenhancement of hadrons produced in d+Au collisions using different centrality\nmeasures is also presented. A smooth evolution with centrality is observed,\nindependent of the chosen centrality measure, when centrality is parameterized\nby the multiplicity density measured near mid-rapidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 16:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-26"}

PLR's primary\nobjective is to measure the curvature of space around the Sun, represented by\nthe Eddington parameter $\\gamma$, with an accuracy of two parts in $10^7$,\nthereby improving today's best result by two orders of magnitude. Other mission\ngoals include measurements of the time-rate-of-change of the gravitational\nconstant, $G$ and of the gravitational inverse square law at 1.5 AU\ndistances--with up to two orders-of-magnitude improvement for each. The science\nparameters will be estimated using laser ranging measurements of the distance\nbetween an Earth station and an active laser transponder on Phobos capable of\nreaching mm-level range resolution. A transponder on Phobos sending 0.25 mJ, 10\nps pulses at 1 kHz, and receiving asynchronous 1 kHz pulses from earth via a 12\ncm aperture will permit links that even at maximum range will exceed a photon\nper second. A total measurement precision of 50 ps demands a few hundred\nphotons to average to 1 mm (3.3 ps) range precision. Existing satellite laser\nranging (SLR) facilities--with appropriate augmentation--may be able to\nparticipate in PLR. Since Phobos' orbital period is about 8 hours, each\nobservatory is guaranteed visibility of the Phobos instrument every Earth day.\nGiven the current technology readiness level, PLR could be started in 2011 for\nlaunch in 2016 for 3 years of science operations. We discuss the PLR's science\nobjectives, instrument, and mission design.

If the drift decays quickly as we\nrescale the walks, we obtain the F.I.N. diffusion as scaling limit. There is a\ncritical speed of decay separating these two main regimes, where a new process\nappears as scaling limit. This critical speed is related to the index $\\alpha$\nof the inhomogeneity of the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 19:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 19:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

This challenges the paradigm that\nmost galaxies form through hierarchical mergers, yet retain supermassive black\nholes at their centers despite having escape velocities much less than v_max.\nInteraction with a circumbinary disk can align the binary black hole spins with\ntheir orbital angular momentum, reducing the recoil velocity of the final black\nhole produced in the subsequent merger. However, the effectiveness of this\nalignment depends on highly uncertain accretion flows near the binary black\nholes. In this Letter, we show that if the spin S_1 of the more massive binary\nblack hole is even partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum L,\nrelativistic spin precession on sub-parsec scales can align the binary black\nhole spins with each other. This alignment significantly reduces the recoil\nvelocity even in the absence of gas. For example, if the angle between S_1 and\nL at large separations is 10 degrees while the second spin S_2 is isotropically\ndistributed, the spin alignment discussed in this paper reduces the median\nrecoil from 864 km/s to 273 km/s for maximally spinning black holes with a mass\nratio of 9/11.

An\nimmediate consequence of weak decoupling duality is that the ability to perform\nquantum identification cannot be cloned. We furthermore establish that the\noptimal amortized rate at which quantum states can be identified through a\nnoisy quantum channel is equal to the entanglement-assisted classical capacity\nof the channel, despite the fact that the task is quantum, not classical, and\nentanglement-assistance is not allowed. In particular, this rate is strictly\npositive for every non-constant quantum channel, including classical channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 20:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 09:03:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 14:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 18:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

This model\nnaturally accounts for the 3 : 2 relation for the upper and lower frequencies\nof the QPOs, and the relation between the black hole mass and QPO frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 03:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Spectroscopic variability attributable to both wind asphericity and\nphotospheric pulsations was present amongst both the hot and cool stellar\npopulations. Given the limitations imposed by the data, we were unable to\ndetermine the physical origin of the wind structure inferred for the OB\nsupergiants, although the inhomogineities in the winds of the Wolf Rayets are\nlikely driven by binary interactions and, conversely, by pulsations in at least\none of the cool hypergiants.

We investigate the effects of rotation and overshoot in early type\nmain sequence pulsators, and attempt to use the low order pulsation frequencies\nto constrain these parameters. This will be applied to a few test models and\ntheta Oph. We use a 2D stellar evolution code and a 2D linear adiabatic\npulsation code to calculate pulsation frequencies for 9.5 Msun models. We\ncalculate low order p-modes for models with a range of rotation rates and\nconvective core overshoot parameters. Using these models, we find that the\nconvective core overshoot has a larger effect on the pulsation frequencies than\nthe rotation, except in the most rapidly rotating models considered. When the\ndifferences in radii are accounted for by scaling the frequencies, the effects\nof rotation diminish, but are not entirely accounted for. We find that\nincreasing the convective core overshoot decreases the large separation, while\nproducing a slight increase in the small separations. We created a model\nfrequency grid which spanned several rotation rates and convective core\novershoot values. Using a modified chi^2 statistic, we are able to recover the\nrotation velocity and core overshoot for a few test models. Finally, we discuss\nthe case of the beta Cephei star theta Oph.

Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that\nthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host\ngalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,\n0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)\nand galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (sSFR). SNe Ia in galaxies\nwith a low sSFR also have a smaller slope (\"beta\") between their luminosities\nand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble\ndiagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects is\ndependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and\nhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an\nintrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If\nthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminosity\ntrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that\nthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia\nhost galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences\nconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable\nto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. We show that\nthe use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass\n(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,\nadequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these\nterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma).

Much emphasis has been put on the network topology of social\ninteractions, however, the multi-dimensional nature of these interactions has\nlargely been ignored in empirical studies, mostly because of lack of data.\nHere, for the first time, we analyze a complete, multi-relational, large social\nnetwork of a society consisting of the 300,000 odd players of a massive\nmultiplayer online game. We extract networks of six different types of\none-to-one interactions between the players.

We then proceed to explore how the inter-dependence of different\nnetwork types determines the organization of the social system. In particular\nwe study correlations and overlap between different types of links and\ndemonstrate the tendency of individuals to play different roles in different\nnetworks.

In-PbTe\ncontacts form by spontaneous alloying, which occurs already at room\ntemperature. The alloyed phase penetrates deeply into PbTe and forms metallic\ncontacts even in the presence of depletion layers at the semiconductor surface.\nAlthough the detailed structure of this phase is unknown, we observe that it\nexhibits a superconducting transition at temperatures below 10 K. This causes\nsuch substantial reduction of the contact resistances that they even become\ncomparable to those predicted for ideal superconductor-normal conductor\ncontacts. Most importantly, this result indicates that the interface phase in\nthe superconducting state becomes nearly homogeneous - in contrast to the\nstructure expected for alloyed contacts. We suggest that the unusual interface\nsuperconductivity is linked to the unique properties of PbTe, namely, its huge\nstatic dielectric constant. Apparently the alloyed interface phase contains\nsuperconducting precipitates randomly distributed within the depletion layers,\nand their Coulomb charging energies are extremely small. According to the\nexisting models of the granular superconductivity, even very weak Josephson\ncoupling between the neighboring precipitates gives rise to the formation of a\nglobal superconducting phase which explains our observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 14:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}

If $A$ is a finitely generated smooth domain over a field $k$ of\ncharacteristic $0$, then the ring $D$ of differential operators on $A$ is a\nNoetherian ring and a finitely generated $k$-algebra. However, when $k$ has\ncharacteristic $p > 0$ or when $A$ is singular, this is no longer true. In\nfact, Bernstein, Gelfand and Gelfand showed that for the cubic cone $A =\nk[x,y,z]/(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$, the ring $D$ is neither Noetherian nor finitely\ngenerated if $k$ has characteristic $0$, and the same is true for the\npolynomial ring $A = k[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ if $k$ has characteristic $p > 0$. In\nthis paper, we prove that the ring $D$ of differential operators on a finitely\ngenerated, smooth and connected algebra $A$ over a field $k$ of characteristic\n$p > 0$ is coherent, and conjecture that same holds for the cubic cone in\ncharacteristic $0$. We argue that the question of coherence is the more\nfundamental one, and use some interesting results of Bavula to study holonomic\n$D$-modules on $A = k[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ in characteristic $p > 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 14:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2018 16:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 May 2018 18:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

Although analysis of flow cytometry\ndata has traditionally considered one or two markers at a time, there has been\nincreasing interest in multidimensional analysis. However, flow cytometers are\nlimited in the number of markers they can jointly observe, which is typically a\nfraction of the number of markers of interest. For this reason, practitioners\noften perform multiple assays based on different, overlapping combinations of\nmarkers. In this paper, we address the challenge of imputing the high\ndimensional jointly distributed values of marker attributes based on\noverlapping marginal observations. We show that simple nearest neighbor based\nimputation can lead to spurious subpopulations in the imputed data, and\nintroduce an alternative approach based on nearest neighbor imputation\nrestricted to a cell's subpopulation. This requires us to perform clustering\nwith missing data, which we address with a mixture model approach and novel EM\nalgorithm. Since mixture model fitting may be ill-posed, we also develop\ntechniques to initialize the EM algorithm using domain knowledge. We\ndemonstrate our approach on real flow cytometry data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 18:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-30"}

We argue that these are the result of {\\em\nlocal} thermal instability in a {\\em globally} stable galaxy cluster core. We\npresent local, high resolution, two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nof thermal instability for conditions appropriate to the intracluster medium\n(ICM); the simulations include thermal conduction along magnetic field lines\nand adiabatic cosmic rays. Thermal conduction suppresses thermal instability\nalong magnetic field lines on scales smaller than the Field length ($\\gtrsim$10\nkpc for the hot, diffuse ICM). We show that the Field length in the cold medium\nmust be resolved both along and perpendicular to the magnetic field in order to\nobtain numerically converged results. Because of negligible conduction\nperpendicular to the magnetic field, thermal instability leads to fine scale\nstructure in the perpendicular direction. Filaments of cold gas along magnetic\nfield lines are thus a natural consequence of thermal instability with\nanisotropic thermal conduction. Nonlinearly, filaments of cold ($\\sim 10^4$ K)\ngas should have lengths (along the magnetic field) comparable to the Field\nlength in the cold medium $\\sim 10^{-4}$ pc! Observations show, however, that\nthe atomic filaments in clusters are far more extended, $\\sim 10$ kpc. Cosmic\nray pressure support (or a small scale turbulent magnetic pressure) may resolve\nthis discrepancy: even a small cosmic ray pressure in the diffuse ICM, $\\sim\n10^{-4}$ of the thermal pressure, can be adiabatically compressed to provide\nsignificant pressure support in cold filaments. This is qualitatively\nconsistent with the large population of cosmic rays invoked to explain the\natomic and molecular line ratios observed in filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 20:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Whereas\nquantization of the magnetic flux with hc/2e prevails in sufficiently thick\nloops with current free interior, the supercurrent in narrow loops is either\nhc/2e or hc/e periodic with the external magnetic flux. The periodicity depends\non the properties of the condensate state, in particular on the Doppler shift\nof the energy spectrum. For an s-wave superconductor in a loop with diameter\nlarger than the coherence length, the Doppler shift is small with respect to\nthe energy gap, and the hc/2e periodic behavior of its flux dependent\nthermodynamic properties is maintained. However, for smaller s-wave loops and,\nmore prominently, narrow d-wave loops of any diameter R, the Doppler shift has\na strong effect on the supercurrent carrying state; as a consequence, the\nfundamental flux periodicity is in fact hc/e. It is shown analytically and\nnumerically that the hc/e periodic component in the supercurrent decays only\nalgebraically as 1/R for large d-wave loops. For nodal superconductors the\ndiscrete nature of the eigenergies close to the Fermi energy has to be\nrespected in the evaluation of the Doppler shift. Furthermore, we investigate,\nwhether the Doppler shift modifies the supercurrent through Josephson junctions\nwith d-wave superconductors. For transparent junctions, the Josephson current\nbehaves similar to the persistent supercurrent in a loop. These distinct\nphysical phenomena can be compared, if the magnetic flux in units of hc/e is\nidentified with the phase variation of the order parameter divided by 4 pi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2010 16:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}
