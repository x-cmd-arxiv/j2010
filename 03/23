The idea of a relation between\nstrongly coupled gauge theories and string theory was pioneered by 't Hooft,\nWilson and Polyakov. A decade ago, Maldacena made this relation explicit by\nconjecturing the exact equivalence of a conformally invariant theory in four\ndimensions, the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, with string theory\nin the AdS5 x S5 background. Other examples of correspondence between a\nconformally invariant theory and string theory in an AdS background were\ndiscovered recently. The comparison of the two sides of the correspondence\nrequires the use of non-perturbative methods. The discovery of integrable\nstructures in gauge theory and string theory led to the conjecture that the two\ntheories are integrable for any value of the coupling constant and that they\nshare the same integrable structure defined non-perturbatively. The last eight\nyears brought remarkable progress in identifying this solvable model and in\nexplicitly solving the problem of computing the spectrum of conformal\ndimensions of the theory. The progress came from the identification of the\ndilatation operator with an integrable spin chain and from the study of the\nstring sigma model.

Here we\ntest this hypothesis by observing a well-known Galactic source where the\nchemistry is dominated by shocks. We have observed several transitions of HNCO\ntowards L1157-mm and two positions (B1 and B2) in the blue lobe of the\nmolecular outflow. The HNCO line profiles exhibit the same characteristics of\nother well-known shock tracers like CH3OH, H2CO, SO or SO2. HNCO, together with\nSO2 and OCS, are the only three molecules detected so far whose emission is\nmuch more intense in B2 than in B1, making these species valuable probes of\nchemical differences along the outflow. The HNCO abundance with respect to H2\nis 0.4-1.8 10^-8 in B1 and 0.3-1 10^-7 in B2. These abundances are the highest\never measured, and imply an increment with respect to L1157-mm of a factor up\nto 83, demonstrating that this molecule is actually a good shock tracer. Our\nresults probe that shocks can actually produce the HNCO abundance measured in\ngalactic nuclei and even higher ones. We propose that the gas phase abundance\nof HNCO is due both to grain mantles erosion by the shock waves and by\nneutral-neutral reactions in gas phase involving CN and O2. The observed\nanticorrelation of CN and HNCO fluxes supports this scenario. The observed\nsimilarities of the HNCO emission and the sulfured molecules may arise due to\nformation pathways involving also O2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 17:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In order to try\nto answer this question we can look at the behaviour of the frequencies of the\nSun's natural seismic modes of oscillation - the p modes. These seismic\nfrequencies also respond to changes in activity and are probes of conditions in\nthe solar interior. The Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) has made\nmeasurements of low-degree (low-$\\ell$) p mode frequencies over the last three\nsolar cycles, and so is in a unique position to explore the current unusual and\nextended solar minimum. We compare the frequency shifts in the low-$\\ell$\np-modes obtained from the BiSON data with the change in surface activity as\nmeasured by different proxies and show there are significant differences\nespecially during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 and into the current\nminimum. We also observe quasi-biennial periodic behaviour in the p mode\nfrequencies over the last 2 cycles that, unlike in the surface measurements,\nseems to be present at mid- and low-activity levels.

The hydrogen ionisation, being almost\nentirely due to charge-exchange with solar wind ions, reflects closely the\nsolar wind flux. Our results show that the solar wind latitudinal structure\nduring the present solar minimum is strikingly different from the previous\nminimum, with a much wider slow solar wind equatorial belt which persists until\nat least the end of 2008. We compute absolute values of the in-ecliptic H\nionisation rates using OMNI solar wind data and use them to calibrate our\nionisation rates at all heliographic latitudes. We then compare the resulting\nfluxes with the synoptic LASCO/C2 electron densities at 6 solar radii. The two\ntime-latitude patterns are strikingly similar over all the cycle. This\ncomparison shows that densities at 6 solar radii can be used to infer the solar\nwind type close to its source, with high (resp. low) densities tracing the slow\n(resp. fast) solar wind, simply because the density reflects at which altitude\noccurs the acceleration. The comparison between the two minima suggests that\nthe fast polar wind acceleration occurs at larger distance during the current\nminimum compared to the previous one. This difference, potentially linked to\nthe magnetic field decrease or(and) the coronal temperature decrease should be\nreproduced by solar wind expansion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 18:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

Subsequent optical-IR observations\nfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. The temporal and spectral behavior at\noptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball model\npredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and XRT frequencies ~ 1.9\ndays after the burst.

This distribution can then be used to forecast the probability of\nfinding even more extreme events, which would otherwise require a much larger\nensemble of simulations to quantify. We use our technique to assess the chance\nof finding concentrations of massive clusters or super- clusters, like the two\nfound in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS), using a\ncounts-in-cells analysis. The Gumbel distribution gives an excellent descrip-\ntion of the distribution of extreme cell counts across two large ensembles of\nsimulations covering different cosmologies, and also when measuring the\nclustering in both real and redshift space. We find examples of structures like\nthose found in the 2dFGRS in the simulations. The chance of finding such\nstructures in a volume equal to that of the 2dFGRS is around 2%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 20:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Accurate predictions are needed in\norder to distinguish between competing cosmological models. We study the\ndistortions in the redshift space power spectrum in $\\Lambda$CDM and\nquintessence dark energy models, using large volume N-body simulations, and\ntest predictions for the form of the redshift space distortions.

Now, in flat\nspacetimes of arbitrary dimension the two standard approaches to the Casimir\nforce, Green's function and zeta function, yield the same result, but for brane\nworld models this was only assumed. In this work we show both approaches yield\nthe same Casimir force in the case of Universal Extra Dimensions and\nRandall-Sundrum scenarios with one and two branes added by p compact\ndimensions. Essentially, the details of the mode eigenfunctions that enter the\nCasimir force in the Green's function approach get removed due to their\northogonality relations with a measure involving the right hyper-volume of the\nplates and this leaves just the contribution coming from the Zeta function\napproach. The present analysis corrects previous results showing a difference\nbetween the two approaches for the single brane Randall-Sundrum; this was due\nto an erroneous hyper-volume of the plates introduced by the authors when using\nthe Green's function.

The line is exceptionally bright from both systems, with apparent\n(lensed) luminosities ~10^11 L_solar.

The model implies ~35% of the total far-IR luminosity\nof the system is generated by the starburst, with the remainder arising from\ndust heated by the AGN. The 88 micron line can also be generated in the narrow\nline region of the AGN if gas densities are around a few 1000 cm-3. For SMM\nJ02399 the [OIII] line likely arises from HII regions formed by hot (Teff\n>40,000 K) young stars in a massive starburst that dominates the far-IR\nluminosity of the system.

The power\nloss is due to the inherent energy dissipation when SCC operate between or\noutside their output target voltages. This drawback was alleviated in this work\nby developing two new classes of SCC providing binary and arbitrary resolution\nof closely spaced target voltages. Special attention is paid to SCC topologies\nof binary resolution. Namely, SCC systems that can be configured to have a\nno-load output to input voltage ratio that is equal to any binary fraction for\na given number of bits. To this end, we define a new number system and develop\nrules to translate these numbers into SCC hardware that follows the algebraic\nbehavior. According to this approach, the flying capacitors are automatically\nkept charged to binary weighted voltages and consequently the resolution of the\ntarget voltages follows a binary number representation and can be made higher\nby increasing the number of capacitors (bits). The ability to increase the\nnumber of target voltages reduces the spacing between them and, consequently,\nincreases the efficiency when the input varies over a large voltage range. The\nthesis presents the underlining theory of the binary SCC and its extension to\nthe general radix case. Although the major application is in step-down SCC, a\nsimple method to utilize these SCC for step-up conversion is also described, as\nwell as a method to reduce the output voltage ripple. In addition, the generic\nand unified model is strictly applied to derive the SCC equivalent resistor,\nwhich is a measure of the power loss. The theoretical predictions are verified\nby simulation and experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2010 22:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-24"}

To design a memetic algorithm one needs to make a host\nof decisions; selecting a population size is one of the most important among\nthem. Most algorithms in the literature fix the population size to a certain\nconstant value. This reduces the algorithm's quality since the optimal\npopulation size varies for different instances, local search procedures and\nrunning times. In this paper we propose an adjustable population size. It is\ncalculated as a function of the running time of the whole algorithm and the\naverage running time of the local search for the given instance. Note that in\nmany applications the running time of a heuristic should be limited and\ntherefore we use this limit as a parameter of the algorithm. The average\nrunning time of the local search procedure is obtained during the algorithm's\nrun. Some coefficients which are independent with respect to the instance or\nthe local search are to be tuned before the algorithm run; we provide a\nprocedure to find these coefficients. The proposed approach was used to develop\na memetic algorithm for the Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP or s-AP in\nthe case of s dimensions) which is an extension of the well-known assignment\nproblem. MAP is NP-hard and has a host of applications. We show that using\nadjustable population size makes the algorithm flexible to perform well for\ninstances of very different sizes and types and for different running times and\nlocal searches. This allows us to select the most efficient local search for\nevery instance type. The results of computational experiments for several\ninstance families and sizes prove that the proposed algorithm performs\nefficiently for a wide range of the running times and clearly outperforms the\nstate-of-the art 3-AP memetic algorithm being given the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 00:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In this phase, the forming disk\nintensively accretes matter from the natal cloud core and undergoes several\nfragmentation episodes. However, most fragments are either destroyed or driven\ninto the innermost regions (and probably onto the star) due to angular momentum\nexchange with spiral arms, leading to multiple FU-Ori-like bursts and disk\nexpansion. Fragments that are sufficiently massive and form in the late\nembedded phase (when the disk conditions are less extreme) may open a gap and\nevolve into giant planets on typical orbits of several tens to several hundreds\nof AU. For this mechanism to work, the natal cloud core must have sufficient\nmass and angular momentum to trigger the burst mode and also form extended\ndisks of the order of several hundreds of AU. When mass loading from the natal\ncloud core diminishes and the main fragmentation phase ends, such extended\ndisks undergo a transient episode of contraction and density increase, during\nwhich they may give birth to a last and survivable set of giant planets on wide\nand relatively stable orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 00:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The angular resolution of the maps is as high as\n0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2\nhigher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented\ndetail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important\nquestions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial\ndistribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any\nindication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do\nthe dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the\ndisk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity\nsolution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The\n1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in\nthe dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about\n2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15\nAU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In\nparticular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under\nreasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5\nJupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU.\nThe radial variation of the dust opacity slope, beta, was investigated by\ncomparing the 1.3mm and 2.8mm observations. We find mean values of beta of 0.5\nand 0.7 for DGTau and RYTau respectively. Variations in beta are smaller than\n0.7 between 20 and 70 AU.

However, even after many years of observations in various wavelength\nbands Cyg X-3 still eludes clear physical understanding. Studying different\nemission bands simultaneously in microquasars has proved to be a fruitful\napproach towards understanding these systems, especially by shedding light on\nthe accretion disc/jet connection. We continue this legacy by constructing a\nhardness-intensity diagram (HID) from archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data\nand linking simultaneous radio observations to it. We find that surprisingly\nCyg X-3 sketches a similar shape in the HID to that seen in other transient\nblack hole X-ray binaries during outburst but with distinct differences.\nTogether with the results of this analysis and previous studies of Cyg X-3 we\nconclude that the X-ray states can be assigned to six distinct states. This\ncategorization relies heavily on the simultaneous radio observations and we\nidentify one new X-ray state, the hypersoft state, similar to the ultrasoft\nstate, which is associated to the quenched radio state during which there is no\nor very faint radio emission. Recent observations of GeV flux observed from Cyg\nX-3 (Tavani et al. 2009; Fermi LAT Collaboration et al. 2009) during a soft\nX-ray and/or radio quenched state at the onset of a major radio flare hint that\na very energetic process is at work during this time, which is also when the\nhypersoft X-ray state is observed. In addition, Cyg X-3 shows flaring with a\nwide range of hardness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 08:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For SNRs\nin the warm ISM, if the injection fraction is larger than 10^{-4}, the DSA is\nefficient enough to convert more than 20 % of the SN explosion energy into CRs\nand the accelerated CR spectrum exhibits a concave curvature flattening to\nE^{-1.6}. Such a flat source spectrum near the knee energy, however, may not be\nreconciled with the CR spectrum observed at Earth. On the other hand, SNRs in\nthe hot ISM, with an injection fraction smaller than 10^{-4}, are inefficient\naccelerators with less than 10 % of the explosion energy getting converted to\nCRs. Also the shock structure is almost test-particle like and the ensuing CR\nspectrum can be steeper than E^{-2}. With amplified magnetic field strength of\norder of 30 microG, Alfven waves generated by the streaming instability may\ndrift upstream fast enough to make the modified test-particle power-law as\nsteep as E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 11:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

In wider Algols the accretion is through a disc so\nthat the accreted material can transfer enough angular momentum to the gainer\nthat material at its equator should be spinning at break-up. We demonstrate\nthat even a small amount of mass transfer, much less than required to produce\ntoday's mass ratios, transfers enough angular momentum to spin the gainer up to\nthis critical rotation velocity. However the accretors in these systems have\nspins typically between 10 and $40\\,$per cent of the critical rate. So some\nmechanism for angular momentum loss from the gainers is required. We consider\ngeneration of magnetic fields in the radiative atmospheres in a differentially\nrotating star and the possibility of angular momentum loss driven by strong\nstellar winds in the intermediate mass stars, such as the primaries of the\nAlgols. Differential rotation, induced by the accretion itself, may produce\nsuch winds which carry away enough angular momentum to reduce their rotational\nvelocities to the today's observed values. We apply this model to two systems\nwith initial periods of 5\\,d, one with initial masses 5 and $3\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$\nand the other with 3.2 and $2\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$.

Larger mass loss is needed for smaller magnetic\nfields. The slow rotation of the gainers in the classical Algol systems is\nexplained by a balance between the spin-up by mass accretion and spin-down by a\nstellar wind linked to a magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 12:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

To this end, we consider two Gaussian processes: (i) a\nshort-range correlated process with an infinite set of time-scales bounded from\nbelow, and (ii) a power-law correlated process with an infinite and unbounded\nset of time-scales. For these processes we investigate the equal position\nconditional probability P(x,t|x,0) and the mean First Passage Time T(L). The\nfunction P(x,t|x,0) can be considered as a proxy of the persistence, i.e. the\nfact that when a process reaches a position x then it spends some time around\nthat position value. The mean First Passage Time can be considered as a proxy\nof how fast is the process in reaching a position at distance L starting from\nposition x. In the first investigation we show that the more time-scales the\nprocess includes, the larger the persistence. Specifically, we show that the\npower-law correlated process shows a slow power-law decay of P(x,t|x,0) to the\nstationary pdf. By contrast, the short range correlated process shows a decay\ndominated by an exponential cut-off. Moreover, we also show that the existence\nof an infinite and unbouded set of time-scales is a necessary and not\nsufficient condition for observing a slow power-law decay of P(x,t|x,0). In the\nsecond investigation, we show that for large values of L the more time-scales\nthe process includes, the larger the mean First Passage Time, i.e. the slowest\nthe process. On the other hand, for small values of L, the more time-scales the\nprocess includes, the smaller the mean First Passage Time, i.e. when a process\nstatistically spends more time in a given position the likelihood that it\nreached nearby positions by chance is also enhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 13:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-08"}

The\nsolution of the Navier--Stokes equations is carried out with a viscous vortex\nparticle method. Configurations of tethered pairs of fish arranged side by side\nare studied by varying the lateral separation distance and relative phase\ndifference. It is shown that, in mirroring symmetry, the fish in the pair\naugment each other's thrust even at relatively large separations (up to ten\nbody lengths). At small distances, this augmentation is primarily brought about\nby a peristaltic pumping in the gap between the fish, whereas at larger\ndistances, the thrust is affected by subtle changes in the vortex shedding at\nthe tail due to interactions with the other fish. In cases without symmetric\nundulation, one fish always draws more benefit from the interaction than the\nother. Finally, lateral configurations with three fish are studied with\nmirroring symmetry between neighboring fish. Whereas the center fish draws a\nnet thrust benefit, this comes at the expense of a net drag on the outer two\nfish. Each adjacent pair in this arrangement is slightly affected by the\npresence of the third fish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 15:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-24"}

To describe the formation of this structure we\nused the model of complex systems by A. Volynskii and S. Bazhenov. The key\nproperty of this model consists in the presence of a rigid coating on a soft\nsubstratum. It is shown that in subduction processes the role of a rigid\ncoating plays the slab substance (lithosphere) and the upper mantle acts as a\nsoft substratum. Within the framework of this model we have obtained the\nestimation of average values of stress in the upper mantle and Young's modulus\nfor the oceanic slab (lithosphere) and upper mantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 15:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

One may thus construct a deterministic model of three fast\nrotating light particles which uses gravitation as the attractive force,\nspecial relativity, the weak equivalence principle and introduces angular\nmomentum quantization as in the Bohr model of the H atom. The model shows the\nexistence of stable rotational states corresponding to highly relativistic\nparticle velocities with radii in the fm range. When the rest masses of the\nthree light particles is in the mass range of neutrinos (~0.1 eV/c^2), then\nsurprisingly the rest masses and Compton wavelengths of these rotational states\nare found to correspond to those of baryons and in fact the masses (~1 GeV/c^2)\nreproduce quite well the light baryon mass spectrum. Interestingly the model\nalso predicts a lower limit for the lifetime of the baryons which is consistent\nwith their measured lifetimes and yields a good approximation for their\nmagnetic moments. It thus appears that this deterministic Bohr-type approach to\nsubatomic phenomena, i.e. a classical special relativistic treatment coupled\nwith the de Broglie wavelength expression to seek conformity with quantum\nmechanics, may be a useful zeroth-order model to explore some quantum gravity\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 08:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 12:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-26"}

Two quantitative measures are compared: the ensemble-averaged\nFinite-time Maximal Lyapunov exponent, a measures of chaos and the normalized\nspectral entropy, a measure of the distance between the numerical time-averaged\nmomentum distribution and the one predicted by thermodynamics. A threshold for\nchaos is found, which depends on two parameters, the nonlinearity and the total\nenergy-per-particle. Below the threshold, the dynamics are regular, while far\nabove the threshold, complete thermalization is observed, as measured by the\nnormalized spectral entropy. We study individual resonances in the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel to determine the criterion for chaos. The criterion based on Chirikov's\nmethod of overlapping resonances diverges in the thermodynamic limit, in\ncontrast to the criterion parameters inferred from numerical calculations,\nsignifying the failure of the standard Chirikov's approach. The Ablowitz-Ladik\nlattice is one of several integrable models that are close to the BHM. We\noutline the method of Inverse Scattering Transform and generate the integrals\nof motion of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. Furthermore, we discuss the possible\nrole of these quantities in the relaxation dynamics of the BHM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 15:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-29"}

This article highlights the impact and implications of those\ndiscoveries, especially as they relate to petroleum and natural gas exploration\nin India and throughout the world. From the reasoning developed here, the\ngenerality of the considerations involved, the understanding developed with\nrespect to the East African Rift System, and the experience garnered from the\nlarger and older Siberian Traps, the prognosis and potential for the region\nbeneath the Deccan Traps of India to eventually become a major source of\npetroleum and natural gas seems quite favorable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 15:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 00:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-01"}

We make use of BINPOP and BINKIN, two\ncomponents of a recently developed population synthesis package. Results focus\non correlations of both binary and spatial evolutionary population\ncharacteristics. Pulsar and long duration gamma-ray burst observations are used\nin concert with our models to draw the conclusions that: double neutron star\nbinaries can merge rapidly on timescales of a few million years (much less than\nthat found for the observed double neutron star population), common envelope\nevolution within these models is a very important phase in double neutron star\nformation, and observations of long gamma-ray burst projected distances are\nmore centrally concentrated than our simulated coalescing double neutron star\nand collapsar Galactic populations. Better agreement is found with dwarf galaxy\nmodels although the outcome is strongly linked to the assumed birth radial\ndistribution. The birth rate of the double neutron star population in our\nmodels range from 4-160 Myr^-1 and the merger rate ranges from 3-150 Myr^-1.\nThe upper and lower limits of the rates results from including electron capture\nsupernova kicks to neutron stars and decreasing the common envelope efficiency\nrespectively. Our double black hole merger rates suggest that black holes\nshould receive an asymmetric kick at birth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 00:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
