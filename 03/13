We find a significant positive\ncorrelation for 99 quasars between optical nuclear luminosities and total radio\n(VLBA) luminosities of unresolved cores at 15 GHz originated at milliarcseconds\nscales.

The radio-loudness of quasars is found to increase at high\nredshifts, which can be a result of lower efficiency of the accretion in AGN\nhaving higher radio luminosities. A strong positive correlation is found\nbetween the intrinsic kinetic power of the jet and the apparent luminosities of\nthe total and the unresolved core emission of the jet at 15 GHz.

We investigate this\nrelationship by comparing the near-infrared (0.7-2.5 micron) spectra of 39\nV-type asteroids to laboratory spectra of HED meteorites. The central\nwavelengths and areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron pyroxene-olivine absorption\nbands that are characteristic of planetary basalts are measured for both the\nasteroidal and meteoritic data. The band centers are shown to be well\ncorrelated, however the ratio of areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron absorption\nbands are much larger for the asteroids than for the meteorites.

Several\nother possible causes of this offset are discussed.\n  Amongst these inner Main Belt asteroids we do not find evidence for\nnon-Vestoid mineralogies. Instead, these asteroids seem to represent a\ncontinuum of compositions, consistent with an origin from a single\ndifferentiated parent body.

Based upon radial-velocity measurements alone, 47 stars at the\nturnoff of the cluster color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and 18 giants are\nidentified as potential members. Five turnoff stars exhibit evidence of\nbinarity while proper-motion data eliminates two of the dwarfs as members. The\nmean cluster radial velocity from probable single-star members is -29.4 +/- 1.3\nkm/sec (sd). A discussion of the current estimates for the cluster reddening,\nderived independently of potential issues with the BV cluster photometry, lead\nto an adopted reddening of E(B-V) = 0.22 +/- 0.04. From equivalent width\nanalyses of 38 probable single-star members near the CMD turnoff, the weighted\naverage abundances are found to be [Fe/H] = +0.43 +/- 0.01, [Ni/H] = +0.53 +/-\n0.02 and [Si/H] = +0.43 (+0.03,-0.04), where the errors refer to the standard\nerrors of the weighted mean.

Recently, the repulsive hard core of a nucleon-nucleon\npotential was obtained in the Sakai-Sugimoto model, and we show that a\ngeneralized version of that model -- with an asymmetric configuration of the\nflavor D8 branes -- also has an attractive potential. While the repulsive\npotential stems from the Chern-Simons interactions of the U(2) flavor gauge\nfields in 5D, the attractive potential is due to a coupling of the gauge fields\nto a scalar field describing fluctuations of the flavor branes' geometry. At\nintermediate distances r between baryons -- smaller than R_KK=O(1)/M_{omega\nmeson} but larger than the radius rho=R_KK/sqrt('t Hooft coupling) of the\ninstanton at the core of a baryon -- both the attractive and the repulsive\npotentials behave as 1/r^2, but the attractive potential is weaker: Depending\non the geometry of the flavor D8 branes, the ratio C=-V_attr/V_rep ranges from\n0 to 1/9. The 5D scalar fields also affect the isovector tensor and spin-spin\nforces, and the overall effect is similar to the isoscalar central forces:\nV(r)->(1-C)*V(r).\n  At longer ranges $r\\gtrsim R_{\\rm KK}$, we find that the attractive potential\ndecays faster than the repulsive potential, so the net potential is always\nrepulsive.

The fraction of absorption(emission)-line galaxies is a\nmonotonically increasing(decreasing) function of both projected galaxy density\nand radial distance to the cluster center. More importantly, the 6 observed E+A\ncluster members are all located between the dark-matter peaks of the cluster\nand within ~0.3Mpc radius of the X-ray flux peak, unlike the E+A galaxies in\nother intermediate-redshift clusters which are usually found to avoid the core\nregion.

First, we consider a disk-like grain rotating with angular velocity at\nan arbitrary angle with respect to the grain symmetry axis and derive the\nrotational damping and excitation coefficients arising from infrared emission,\nplasma-grain interactions and electric dipole emission. The angular velocity\ndistribution and the electric dipole emission spectrum for grains is calculated\nusing the Langevin equation, for cases both with and without fast internal\nrelaxation. Our results show that, the peak emissivity of spinning dust,\ncompared to earlier studies, increases by a factor of ~2 for the Warm Neutral\nMedium (WNM), the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM), the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and\nthe Photodissociation Region (PDR), and by a factor ~4 for Reflection Nebulae\n(RN). The frequency at the emission peak also increases by factors ~1.4 to ~2\nfor these media. The increased emission and peak frequency result from the\nnon-sphericity of grain shape and from the anisotropy in damping and excitation\nalong directions parallel and perpendicular to the grain symmetry axis. Second,\nwe provide a detailed numerical study including transient spin-up of grains by\nsingle-ion collisions. The impulses broaden the emission spectrum and increase\nthe peak emissivity for the CNM, WNM and WIM.

This limitation is manifested in the loss of high spatial\nfrequency information contained in evanescent waves. As a result, conventional\nfar-field optics yields no information about an object's subwavelength\nfeatures. Here we propose a novel approach to recovering evanescent waves in\nthe far field, thereby enabling subwavelength-resolved imaging and spatial\nspectroscopy. Our approach relies on shifting the frequency and the wave vector\nof near-field components via scattering on acoustic phonons. This process\neffectively removes the spatial frequency cut-off for unambiguous far field\ndetection. A straightforward extension of this technique, which we call spatial\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy, allows to preserve phase information,\nmaking it possible to perform 3D subwavelength imaging.

Although ionized astrophysical objects, like stars and\ngalactic disks, are almost perfectly conducting, they show indications of\nchanges in topology, `magnetic reconnection', on dynamical time scales.\nReconnection can be observed directly in the solar corona, but can also be\ninferred from the existence of large scale dynamo activity inside stellar\ninteriors. Solar flares and gamma ray busts are usually associated with\nmagnetic reconnection. Previous work has concentrated on showing how\nreconnection can be rapid in plasmas with very small collision rates. Here we\npresent numerical evidence, based on three dimensional simulations, that\nreconnection in a turbulent fluid occurs at a speed comparable to the rms\nvelocity of the turbulence, regardless of the value of the resistivity. In\nparticular, this is true for turbulent pressures much weaker than the magnetic\nfield pressure so that the magnetic field lines are only slightly bent by the\nturbulence. These results are consistent with the proposal by Lazarian and\nVishniac (1999) that reconnection is controlled by the stochastic diffusion of\nmagnetic field lines, which produces a broad outflow of plasma from the\nreconnection zone. This work implies that reconnection in a turbulent fluid\ntypically takes place in approximately a single eddy turnover time, with broad\nimplications for dynamo activity and particle acceleration throughout the\nuniverse. In contrast, the reconnection in 2D configurations in the presence of\nturbulence depends on resistivity, i.e. is slow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2010 23:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-16"}

By\nconsidering the mass-stripping effect from an optically thick wind and the\neffect of thermally unstable disk, we systematically carried out binary\nevolution calculation for WD + MS and WD + RG systems. Here, we focus on the\nevolution of WD + RG systems. We found that some donor stars at the time of the\nsupernova explosion contain little hydrogen-rich material on top of the helium\ncore (as low as 0.017 $M_{\\odot}$), which is smaller than the upper limit to\nthe amount derived from observations of material stripped-off by explosion\nejecta. Thus, no hydrogen line is expected in the nebular spectra of these SN\nIa. We also derive the distributions of the envelope mass and the core mass of\nthe companions from WD + RG channel at the moment of a supernova explosion by\nadopting a binary population synthesis approach. We rarely find a RG companion\nwith a very low-mass envelope. Furthermore, our models imply that the remnant\nof the WD + RG channel emerging after the supernova explosion is a single\nlow-mass white dwarf (0.15 $M_{\\odot}$ - 0.30 $M_{\\odot}$). The absence of a\nhydrogen line in nebular spectra of SNe Ia provides support to the proposal\nthat the WD + RG system is the progenitor of SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2010 00:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2010 00:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

However, this\nkind of time reversal only lets in the Hamiltonian of the coordinate space,\nwithout considering that the creation and annihilation processes of particles\nshould also be reversed when the concrete problems are calculated in momentum\nspace. In fact, according to the current transformation of quantum field\ntheory, creation operator of spinor particle is still creation operator and\nannihilation operator is also still annihilation operator. This result does not\nrepresent the real meaning of time reversal. In the interaction process, a\nparticle's creation operator should become the annihilation operator and its\nannihilation operator should become the creation operator after time reversal.\nIt is proved that when the reversion of creation and annihilation processes is\nconsidered in momentum space, under the condition of high energy, a great\nsymmetry violation of time reversal would be caused in some low order processes\nof electromagnetic interaction just as the Compton scattering in which the\npropagation lines of fermions are contained. This result contradicts with the\nexperiments of particle physics and is impossible. Meanwhile, it is proved that\nthe normalization processes of the third order vertex angles of electromagnetic\ninteraction also violate time reversal symmetry, no matter in the coordinate\nspace or in the momentum space. But the symmetry violation is small with a\nmagnitude order about 10(-5). The similar problems exist in the current C\ntransformation of quantum field theory. The C transformation of creation and\nannihilation operator can not be consistent with the C transformation of spinor\nparticle's wave functions in momentum space. We can obtain the correct C\ntransformation of creation and annihilation operator, but can not obtain the\ncorrect C transformation of wave functions in momentum space. Therefore, the\ncurrent rules of C,T transformations in quantum field theory has serious defect\nand should be redefined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2010 01:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-16"}

This is an important network model to explore because channel probing\nmay be costly or infeasible in some contexts. In this case, we can use channel\nmemory with ACK/NACK feedback from previous transmissions to improve network\nthroughput. Computing in closed form the capacity region of this network is\ndifficult because it involves solving a high dimension partially observed\nMarkov decision problem. Instead, in this paper we construct an inner and outer\nbound on the capacity region, showing that the bound is tight when the number\nof users is large and the traffic is symmetric. For the case of heterogeneous\ntraffic and any number of users, we propose a simple queue-dependent policy\nthat can stabilize the network with any data rates strictly within the inner\ncapacity bound.

The degree of freedom for the HD field can\nbe converted to multiple fields with canonical kinetic terms up to the overall\nsign. The Lagrangian describing the dynamics of the multiple fields is known as\nthe Lee-Wick (LW) form. The first step to obtain the LW form for a given HD\nLagrangian is to find an auxiliary field (AF) Lagrangian which is equivalent to\nthe original HD Lagrangian up to the quantum level. Till now, the AF Lagrangian\nhas been studied only for N=2 and 3 cases, where $N$ is the number of poles of\nthe two-point function of the HD scalar field. We construct the AF Lagrangian\nfor arbitrary $N$. By the linear combinations of AF fields, we also obtain the\ncorresponding LW form. We find the explicit mapping matrices among the HD\nfields, the AF fields, and the LW fields. As an exercise of our construction,\nwe calculate the relations among parameters and mapping matrices for $N=2,3$,\nand 4 cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2010 15:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 2010 14:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 11:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
