Here, using an\nadvection-reaction-diffusion model, we investigate the distribution and\ncompetition of phytoplankton species in a water column, in which inverse\nresource gradients of light and a nutrient can limit growth of the biomass.\nThis problem poses a challenge for ecologists, as the location of a production\nlayer is not fixed, but rather depends on many internal parameters and\nenvironmental factors. In particular, we study the influence of an upper mixed\nlayer (UML) in this system and show that it leads to a variety of dynamic\neffects: (i) Our model predicts alternative density profiles with a maximum of\nbiomass either within or below the UML, thereby the system may be bistable or\nthe relaxation from an unstable state may require a long-lasting transition.\n(ii) Reduced mixing in the deep layer can induce oscillations of the biomass;\nwe show that a UML can sustain these oscillations even if the diffusivity is\nless than the critical mixing for a sinking phytoplankton population. (iii) A\nUML can strongly modify the outcome of competition between different\nphytoplankton species, yielding bistability both in the spatial distribution\nand in the species composition. (iv) A light limited species can obtain a\ncompetitive advantage if the diffusivity in the deep layers is reduced below a\ncritical value. This yields a subtle competitive exclusion effect, where the\noscillatory states in the deep layers are displaced by steady solutions in the\nUML.

Recent research suggests that B\ncells can acquire antigen in membrane-bound form on the surface of\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs), with signaling being initiated within a few\nseconds of B cell/APC contact. During the earliest stages of B cell/APC\ncontact, B cell receptors (BCRs) on protrusions of the B cell surface bind to\nantigen on the APC surface and form micro-clusters of 10-100 BCR/Antigen\ncomplexes. In this study, we use computational modeling to show that B cell\naffinity discrimination at the level of BCR-antigen micro-clusters requires a\nthreshold antigen binding time, in a manner similar to kinetic proofreading. We\nfind that if BCR molecules become signaling-capable immediately upon binding\nantigen, there is a loss in serial engagement due to the increase in bond\nlifetime as koff decreases. This results in decreasing signaling strength as\naffinity increases. A threshold time for antigen to stay bound to BCR before\nthe latter becomes signaling-capable favors high affinity BCR-antigen bonds, as\nthese long-lived bonds can better fulfill the threshold time requirement than\nlow-affinity bonds. A threshold antigen binding time of ~10 seconds results in\nmonotonically increasing signaling with affinity, replicating the affinity\ndiscrimination pattern observed in B cell activation experiments. This time\nmatches well (within order of magnitude) with the experimentally observed time\n(~ 20 seconds) required for the BCR signaling domains to undergo antigen and\nlipid raft-mediated conformational changes that lead to association with Syk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2010 18:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-09"}

This\nis a rich family of functions which encompasses many of the important examples\nin the literature. It is thus of great interest to understand what properties\nof $f$ and $g$ affect the communication complexity of $(f \\comp g^n)$, and in\nwhat way.\n  Recently, Sherstov \\cite{She09b} and independently Shi-Zhu \\cite{SZ09b}\ndeveloped conditions on the inner function $g$ which imply that the quantum\ncommunication complexity of $f \\comp g^n$ is at least the approximate\npolynomial degree of $f$. We generalize both of these frameworks. We show that\nthe pattern matrix framework of Sherstov works whenever the inner function $g$\nis {\\em strongly balanced}---we say that $g: X \\times Y \\to \\{-1,+1\\}$ is\nstrongly balanced if all rows and columns in the matrix $M_g=[g(x,y)]_{x,y}$\nsum to zero.

We relax this to the\nusual notion of discrepancy. We also enhance the framework of composed\nfunctions studied so far by considering functions $F(x,y) = f(g(x,y))$, where\nthe range of $g$ is a group $G$. When $G$ is Abelian, the analogue of the\nstrongly balanced condition becomes a simple group invariance property of $g$.\nWe are able to formulate a general lower bound on $F$ whenever $g$ satisfies\nthis property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 08:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-09"}

In order to demonstrate the abundance of base\nsequences, we have previously attached to BS(n+1,n) a graph Gamma_n and\ncomputed the Gamma_n for n <= 27. We now extend these computations and\ndetermine the Gamma_n for n=28,...,35. We also propose a conjecture describing\nthese graphs in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 11:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-27"}

Hence,\nresearchers, for so long, have been examining ways to utilize biometric\nfeatures of the user instead of a memorable password or passphrase, in an\neffort to generate strong and repeatable cryptographic keys. Our objective is\nto incorporate the volatility of the user's biometric features into the\ngenerated key, so as to make the key unguessable to an attacker lacking\nsignificant knowledge of the user's biometrics. We go one step further trying\nto incorporate multiple biometric modalities into cryptographic key generation\nso as to provide better security. In this article, we propose an efficient\napproach based on multimodal biometrics (Iris and fingerprint) for generation\nof secure cryptographic key. The proposed approach is composed of three modules\nnamely, 1) Feature extraction, 2) Multimodal biometric template generation and\n3) Cryptographic key generation. Initially, the features, minutiae points and\ntexture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images\nrespectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the\nfeature level to construct the multi-biometric template. Finally, a 256-bit\nsecure cryptographic key is generated from the multi-biometric template. For\nexperimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly\navailable sources and the iris images from CASIA Iris Database. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 12:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-09"}

Here the problem is set in terms of the\n$1-$point velocity probability density function (PDF) which determines a\ncomplete IKT-statistical model for NS fluids. This raises the interesting\nquestion of identifying the statistical assumptions under which a Gaussian PDF\ncan be achieved in such a context. In this paper it is proven that for the IKT\nstatistical model, HIST requires necessarily that $f_{1}$ must be SIED (namely\n\\textit{stationary}, \\textit{isotropic} and \\textit{% everywhere-defined}).\nThis implies, in turn, that the functional form of the PDF is uniquely\nprescribed at all times. In particular, it is found that necessarily the PDF\nmust coincide with an isotropic Gaussian distribution.

Matter-wave optics is still a young, but rapidly progressing\nscience. The Space Atom Interferometer project (SAI), funded by the European\nSpace Agency, in a multi-pronged approach aims to investigate both\nexperimentally and theoretically the various aspects of placing atom\ninterferometers in space: the equipment needs, the realistically expected\nperformance limits and potential scientific applications in a micro-gravity\nenvironment considering all aspects of quantum, relativistic and metrological\nsciences.

J. Busack, 2007). This simulation has led to the\nprediction of anomaly values, to be expected for the Rosetta flybys of Mars in\n2007, and following twice of Earth in 2007 and 2009. While the data for the\nMars flyby are yet under evaluation, the predictions of the formula for the\nlast two Earth flybys of Rosetta are fully confirmed now. This is remarkable,\nsince an alternatively proposed formula (Anderson et al., 2007) failed to\npredict the correct values for the recent flybys. For the Mercury flybys of the\nMessenger spacecraft, this alternative formula predicts a null result. In the\nmeantime, Doppler residuals of these flybys on 14.01.2008 and 06.10.2008 are\navailabel. On both flybys, significant residuals were observed, using gravity\ndata derived by Mariner 10 on Mercury (D. E. Smith et al., 2009). According to\nthe authors, these residuals cannot be eliminated totally by adjustment of the\nsecond degree gravity coefficients and by assumption of irregular mass\nconcentrations of acceptable value on Mercury. In this investigation, I adapt\nthe output of the simulation program to compare with the measured Doppler\nresiduals of the Mercury flybys without changing the formerly derived\nparameters for the Earth flybys. The simulation with these parameters leads to\nDoppler residuals of the Mercury flybys compatible with the measured curves.\nAdditionally, the expected flyby anomalies are calculated. Since the gravity\nfield of Mercury is not explored yet with sufficient accuracy, this result\ncannot be falsified or confirmed until the evaluation of the coming Mercury\norbits of Messenger will be finished. If the proposed empirical formula would\nbe confirmed then again, this would be a strong indication of an underlying\nphysical reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2010 14:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}
