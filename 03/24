Semilocal\nDFT calculations predict a spinless adsorbed molecule, however the inclusion of\nthe U leads to the polarization of the molecule by shifting a spin-polarized\nmolecular orbital towards the Fermi level. A molecular resonance at the Fermi\nlevel can imply a decrease in conductance while in the off-resonance case, an\nincrease in conductance is the expected IETS signal. We use the lowest-order\nexpansion on the electron-vibration coupling, in order to evaluate the\nmagnitude and spatial distribution of the inelastic signal. This allows us to\nreproduce the experimental data in: (i) the negative conductance variation\nobserved in the vibrational spectra of O_2 along the [001] direction, (ii) the\nspatial distribution of the conductance changes recorded over the O_2 molecule\nfor the O--O stretch and the antisymmetric O_2--Ag stretch vibrations, (iii)\nthe absence of signal for the center-of-mass and hindered rotations modes, and\n(iv) the lack of IETS signal for the molecule chemisorbed along the [1-10]\ndirection.

The rotating reference system is constructed as an infinite set of\nFrenet-Seret tetrads so that the detector is at rest in a tetrad at each proper\ntime. Frequency spectrum of correlation functions contains the Planck thermal\nfactor with temperature $T_{rot} = \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega}{2 \\pi k_B} $. The energy\ndensity the rotating detector observes is proportional to the sum of energy\ndensities of Planck's spectrum at the temperature $T_{rot}$ and zero-point\nradiation. The proportionality factor is $2/3 (4 \\gamma^2 -1)$ for an EMF and\n$2/9 (4 \\gamma^2 -1)$ for a MSF, where $\\gamma = (1 - (\\frac{\\Omega\nr}{c})^2)^{-1/2}$, and r is a rotation radius. The origin of these thermal\neffects is the periodicity of the correlation functions and their discrete\nspectrum, both following rotation with angular velocity $\\Omega$. The thermal\nenergy can also be interpreted as a source of a vacuum force (VF) applied to\nthe rotating detector from the vacuum field. The VF depends on the size of\nneither the charge nor the mass, like the force in the Casimir model for a\ncharged particle, but, contrary to the last one, VF is attractive and directed\nto the center of the circular orbit. VF infinitely grows in magnitude with\norbit radius. The orbits with a radius greater than $c/ \\Omega$ do not exist\nbecause the returning VF becomes infinite. On the uttermost orbit with the\nradius $c / \\Omega$, a linear velocity of the rotating particle would have\nbecome c. The VF becomes very small and proportional to radius when r is very\nsmall.

However\nthe minimum magnetization has never been tested. We investigate the time\nevolution of an accretion disk threaded by a weak vertical magnetic field. The\nstrength of the field is such that the disk magnetization falls off rapidly\nwith radius. Four 2.5D numerical simulations of viscous resistive accretion\ndisk are performed using the magnetohydrodynamic code PLUTO. In these\nsimulations, a mean field approach is used and turbulence is assumed to give\nrise to anomalous transport coefficients (alpha prescription). The large scale\nmagnetic field introduces only a small perturbation to the disk structure, with\naccretion driven by the dominant viscous torque. A super fast magnetosonic jet\nis observed to be launched from the innermost regions and remains stationary\nover more than 953 Keplerian orbits. The self-confined jet is launched from a\nfinite radial zone in the disk which remains constant over time. Ejection is\nmade possible because the magnetization reaches unity at the disk surface, due\nto the steep density decrease. However, no ejection is reported when the\nmidplane magnetization becomes too small. The asymptotic jet velocity remains\nnevertheless too low to explain observed jets due to the negligible power\ncarried away by the jet. Astrophysical disks with superheated surface layers\ncould drive analogous outflows even if their midplane magnetization is low.\nSufficient angular momentum would be extracted by the turbulent viscosity to\nallow the accretion process to continue. The magnetized outflows would be no\nmore than byproducts, rather than a fundamental driver of accretion. However,\nif the midplane magnetization increases towards the center, a natural\ntransition to an inner jet dominated disk could be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 17:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We investigate on the possibility to combine a\nPati-Salam model with the discrete flavour symmetry $S_4$ that gives rise to\nquark-lepton complementarity. Under appropriate assumptions at the GUT scale,\nthe model reproduces fermion masses and mixings both in the quark and in the\nlepton sectors.

We present objects of\nparticular interest: exceptionally numerous sample of single-mode\nsecond-overtone pulsators, five double Cepheids, two Cepheids with eclipsing\nvariations superimposed on the pulsation light curves. At least 139\nfirst-overtone Cepheids exhibit low-amplitude secondary variations with periods\nin the range 0.60-0.65 of the primary ones. These stars populate three distinct\nsequences in the Petersen diagram. The origin of this secondary modulation is\nstill unknown. Contrary to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we found only a few\ncandidates for anomalous Cepheids in the SMC. This fact may be a clue for the\nexplanation of the origin of the anomalous Cepheids. The period and luminosity\ndistributions of Cepheids in both Magellanic Clouds suggest that there are two\nor three populations of classical Cepheids in each of the galaxies. The main\ndifference between the LMC and SMC lays in different numbers of Cepheids in\neach group. We fit the period-luminosity (PL) relations of SMC Cepheids and\ncompare them with the LMC PL laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 20:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2010 20:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

A common approach to avoid this\ndifficulty is to design a proper numerical scheme and/or a proper mesh so that\nthe numerical solution validates the discrete counterpart (DMP) of the maximum\nprinciple satisfied by the continuous solution. A well known mesh condition for\nthe DMP satisfaction by the linear finite element solution of isotropic\ndiffusion problems is the non-obtuse angle condition that requires the dihedral\nangles of mesh elements to be non-obtuse. In this paper, a generalization of\nthe condition, the so-called anisotropic non-obtuse angle condition, is\ndeveloped for the finite element solution of heterogeneous anisotropic\ndiffusion problems. The new condition is essentially the same as the existing\none except that the dihedral angles are now measured in a metric depending on\nthe diffusion matrix of the underlying problem. Several variants of the new\ncondition are obtained. Based on one of them, two metric tensors for use in\nanisotropic mesh generation are developed to account for DMP satisfaction and\nthe combination of DMP satisfaction and mesh adaptivity.

The\nmeasured vertical velocity dispersion of the H_alpha knots between 1 - 1.8 R25\n(13.5 - 23.2 kpc) is < 11 km/s. We assume that the H_alpha knots trace an\n'intermediate' vertical mass density distribution (between the isothermal\nsech(z)^2 and exponential distributions) with a constant scaleheight across the\nouter disk (h_z = 700 pc) and estimate a total surface mass density of 7.5\nsolar masses/pc^2.

It can be used to constrain the density\nprofiles and to measure the mass of the lenses. Moreover, the abundance of\nstrong lensing events can be used to constrain the structure formation and the\ncosmological parameters through the so-called \"arc-statistics\" approach.\nHowever, several issues related to the usage of strong lensing clusters in\ncosmological applications are still controversial, leading to the suspect that\nseveral biases may affect this very peculiar class of objects. With this study\nwe aim at better understanding the properties of galaxy clusters which can\npotentially act as strong lenses. We do so by investigating the properties of a\nlarge sample of galaxy clusters extracted from the N-body/hydrodynamical\nsimulation MareNostrum Universe. We explore the correlation between the cross\nsection for lensing and many properties of clusters, like the mass, the\nthree-dimensional and projected shapes, their concentrations, the X-ray\nluminosity and the dynamical activity. We find that the probability of strong\nalignments between the major axes of the lenses and the line of sight is a\ngrowing function of the lensing cross section. In projection, the strong lenses\nappear rounder within R200, but we find that their cores tend to be more\nelliptical as the lensing cross section increases. We also find that the\ncluster concentrations estimated from the projected density profiles tend to be\nbiased high. The X-ray luminosity of strong lensing clusters is higher than\nthat of normal lenses of similar mass and redshift. This is particular\nsignificant for the least massive lenses. Finally, we find that the strongest\nlenses generally exhibit an excess of kinetic energy within the virial radius,\nindicating that they are more dynamically active than usual clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 22:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The theory underlying of this scheme is on the proposal of\nthe intertwining operator for Darboux transfomations on one-dimensional Dirac\nequation amalgamating the \\textit{vector-quantum gates duality} of Pauli\nmatrices. Simultaneous transformation of qubit and energy can be accomplished\nby setting the $\\{\\textit{control, cyclic}\\}$-operators attached on the\ncoupling between one-qubit quantum gate: the chose of \\textit{cyclic}-operator\nswaps the qubit and energy simultaneously, while \\textit{control}-operator\nensures the energy conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 08:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 06:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 05:26:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 08:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 05:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 04:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 09:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

As an alternative to traditional current-free \"potential field\"\nextrapolations, we investigate a model for the global coronal magnetic field\nwhich is non-potential and time-dependent, following the build-up and transport\nof magnetic helicity due to flux emergence and large-scale photospheric\nmotions. This helicity concentrates into twisted magnetic flux ropes, which may\nlose equilibrium and be ejected. Here, we consider how the magnetic structure\npredicted by this model-in particular the flux ropes-varies over the solar\nactivity cycle, based on photospheric input data from six periods of cycle 23.\nThe number of flux ropes doubles from minimum to maximum, following the total\nlength of photospheric polarity inversion lines. However, the number of flux\nrope ejections increases by a factor of eight, following the emergence rate of\nactive regions. This is broadly consistent with the observed cycle modulation\nof coronal mass ejections, although the actual rate of ejections in the\nsimulation is about a fifth of the rate of observed events. The model predicts\nthat, even at minimum, differential rotation will produce sheared,\nnon-potential, magnetic structure at all latitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 14:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In the latter case, the coin emerges as an\nanalog of the spinor degree of freedom. Discrete-time quantum walk as a coupled\nform of the continuous-time quantum walk is also shown by transforming the\ndecoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to the Schrodinger form. By\nshowing the coin to be a means to make the walk reversible, and that the\nDirac-like structure is a consequence of the coin use, our work suggests that\nthe relativistic causal structure is a consequence of conservation of\ninformation. However, decoherence (modelled by projective measurements on\nposition space) generates entropy that increases with time, making the walk\nirreversible and thereby producing an arrow of time.

The data\nreveal the existence of a broad range in the abundances of these elements, and\na comparison with similar data for main sequence stars enables insight into the\nevolutionary history of the cluster. The majority of the red giant branch stars\nwere found to be depleted in carbon, i.e. [C/Fe]<0, while [N/Fe] for the same\nstars shows a range of ~1 dex, from [N/Fe]~0.7 to 1.7 dex.

Evidence for evolutionary\nmixing on the red giant branch is found from the fact that the relative carbon\nabundances on the main sequence are generally higher than those on the red\ngiant branch. However, comparison of the red giant branch and main sequence\nsamples shows that the upper level of nitrogen enhancement is similar in both\nsets at [N/Fe]~2.0dex.

According to current cosmological theories,\ngalaxies are embedded within massive non-baryonic dark matter (DM) halos, which\naffects their formation and evolution. It is therefore highly rewarding to\nunderstand the role of tidal interaction between the dark and luminous matter\nin galaxies. The current investigation is devoted to Early-Type Galaxies\n(ETGs), looking in particular at the possibility of establishing whether the\ntidal interaction of the DM halo with the luminous baryonic component may be at\nthe origin of the so-called \"tilt\" of the Fundamental Plane (FP). The extension\nof the tensor virial theorem to two-component matter distributions implies the\ncalculation of the self potential energy due to a selected subsystem, and the\ntidal potential energy induced by the other one. The additional assumption of\nhomeoidally striated density profiles allows analytical expressions of the\nresults for some cases of astrophysical interest. The current investigation\nraises from the fact that the profile of the (self + tidal) potential energy of\nthe inner component shows maxima and minima, suggesting the possible existence\nof preferential scales for the virialized structure, i.e. a viable explanation\nof the so called \"tilt\" of the FP. It is found that configurations related to\nthe maxima do not suffice, by themselves, to interpret the FP tilt, and some\nother relation has to be looked for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 15:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-25"}

My first thought,\nand presumably the default expectation, was that I'd talk in a general way\nabout the grandeur of high energy physics and the exciting future we\nanticipate, especially with LHC coming on line. But an unfortunate byproduct of\nthe delays at LHC and the slow pace of other experiments is that I've already\ndone that sort of thing many times, as have many other conference embellishers,\nand the ritual is getting stale. So I'll speed through the litany, and then\nindulge myself by advertising some ideas I've been fond of, some for quite a\nwhile, that I think are interesting, promising, and not as well known as they\nshould be.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 15:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 May 2010 19:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

As applications, a theory of `rational' skeletons akin to Kingman's\ninteger skeletons, and more appropriate to a measurable setting, is developed,\nand two combinatorial results in the spirit of van der Waerden's celebrated\ntheorem on arithmetic progressions are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 15:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-25"}

We\ninterpret this as evidence that the population dynamics in the ocean is\napproximately scale-invariant. We use this invariance in the construction and\nsolution of a size-structured dynamical population model. Starting from a\nMarkov model encoding the basic processes of predation, reproduction,\nmaintenance respiration and intrinsic mortality, we derive a partial\nintegro-differential equation describing the dependence of abundance on weight\nand time. Our model represents an extension of the jump-growth model and hence\nalso of earlier models based on the McKendrick--von Foerster equation. The\nmodel is scale-invariant provided the rate functions of the stochastic\nprocesses have certain scaling properties. We determine the steady-state power\nlaw solution, whose exponent is determined by the relative scaling between the\nrates of the density-dependent processes (predation) and the rates of the\ndensity-independent processes (reproduction, maintenance, mortality). We study\nthe stability of the steady-state against small perturbations and find that\ninclusion of maintenance respiration and reproduction in the model has astrong\nstabilising effect. Furthermore, the steady state is unstable against a change\nin the overall population density unless the reproduction rate exceeds a\ncertain threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 15:55:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 May 2010 07:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2010 10:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-17"}
