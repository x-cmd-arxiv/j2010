Although the current high-z\nsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of the\nactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.\nIndependent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities are\nconsidered, low- and high-z SFG galaxy populations appear to follow similar\nmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. The\ngas-depletion time scale in these SFGs grows from 0.5 Gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 Gyrs\nat z~0. Because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller than\nthe Hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gas\nfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo and\nstellar feedback. In contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at both\nlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosity\nper unit gas mass. Only some fraction of this difference can be explained by\nuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must be\nintrinsic. The most likely interpretation is that the star formation relation\nis driven by global dynamical effects. For a given mass, the more compact\nmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more\ncompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quickly\nthrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. When\nthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, disk\ngalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.\nThe mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than the\ndisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 16:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 11:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We\ndiscuss about the relations between background flux and low-energy spectra\nwhich are counted by their zero-modes. Yukawa couplings are free parameters in\nthe standard model and may be related to the underlying physics. In the string\ntheory or its low-energy limit, they are determined by overlap integral of\nwavefunctions on extra dimensions. We also study the higher order couplings\nbased on the field theoretical approach. From the analysis of generic n-point\ncouplings, we can discuss about flavor structures. We find that in such a\nconstruction some discrete flavor symmetries appear in the four dimensional\neffective theory. Their phenomenological implications are discussed.\nFurthermore we extend these constructions to orbifold background. Magnetic flux\nstill plays an important role and leads to various types of low-energy spectra\ndifferent from that of toroidal compactifications.

We identify more than 50 objects as OB supergiants. We find\nalmost 30 luminous early-B supergiants and a number of less luminous late-O\nsupergiants. In addition, we find a few mid B supergiants with very high\nluminosity, some of them displaying signs of heavy mass loss.

They are most accurately\nmodelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with the\nstellar parameters effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity, the\nso-called fitting functions. Here we present new empirical fitting functions\nfor the 25 optical Lick absorption line indices based on the new stellar\nlibrary MILES. The major improvements with respect to the Lick/IDS library are\nthe better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal-\nto-noise, and a careful flux calibration. In fact we find that errors on\nindividual index measurements in MILES are considerably smaller than in\nLick/IDS. Instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fitting\nfunctions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. We\nprovide fitting functions for both Lick/IDS and MILES spectral resolutions, and\ncompare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. A Fortran\n90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellar\npopulation models. We further calculate the offsets in index measurements\nbetween the Lick/IDS system to a flux calibrated system. For this purpose we\nuse the three libraries MILES, ELODIE, and STELIB. We find that offsets are\nnegligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices Hbeta, Mgb,\nFe5270, and Fe5335. In a number of cases, however, the difference between flux\ncalibrated library and Lick/IDS is significant with the offsets depending on\nindex strengths. Interestingly, there is no general agreement between the three\nlibraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of a\nuniversal offset between the Lick/IDS and flux calibrated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We use a\nmerger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which QSs might form as a function\nof redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting QS and seed black\nhole populations. We relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergers\nof gas-rich galaxies, and to a threshold for global gravitational instability,\nwhich we link to the angular momentum of the host. This is the main parameter\nof our models. Once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halo\npotential; the properties of the resulting QS and seed black hole depend on\nthis rate. After the epoch of QSs, we model the growth of MBHs within their\nhosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. We compare MBH seeds grown inside\nquasistars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the first\nmetal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of MBH\nformation operate simultaneously. We find that a limited range of QS/MBH\nformation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observational\nconstraints. Our models match the density of z = 6 quasars, the cumulative mass\ndensity accreted onto MBHs (according to Soltan's argument), and the current\nmass density of MBHs. The mass function of QSs peaks at mass ~ 1e6 solar\nmasses, and we calculate the number counts for the JWST in the 2-10 micron\nband.

The aim is to jointly optimize end-to-end transport layer\nrates, network code design variables, broadcast link flows, link capacities,\naverage power consumption, and short-term power allocation policies. As in the\nrouting paradigm where nodes simply forward packets, the cross-layer\noptimization problem with network coding is non-convex in general. It is proved\nhowever, that with network coding, dual decomposition for multicast is optimal\nso long as the fading at each wireless link is a continuous random variable.\nThis lends itself to provably convergent subgradient algorithms, which not only\nadmit a layered-architecture interpretation but also optimally integrate\nnetwork coding in the protocol stack. The dual algorithm is also paired with a\nscheme that yields near-optimal network design variables, namely multicast\nend-to-end rates, network code design quantities, flows over the broadcast\nlinks, link capacities, and average power consumption. Finally, an asynchronous\nsubgradient method is developed, whereby the dual updates at the physical layer\ncan be affordably performed with a certain delay with respect to the resource\nallocation tasks in upper layers. This attractive feature is motivated by the\ncomplexity of the physical layer subproblem, and is an adaptation of the\nsubgradient method suitable for network control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 21:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 21:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-06"}

Combined with earlier Keck and published ESO VLT\ndata, our sample contains more than 600 dropouts, offering new insight into the\nnature of sub-L* sources typical of those likely to dominate the cosmic\nreionisation process. Here we use this sample to characterise the fraction of\nstrong Lya emitters within the continuum-selected dropouts. By quantifying how\nthe \"Lya fraction\" varies with redshift, we seek to constrain changes in Lya\ntransmission associated with reionisation. In order to distinguish the effects\nof reionisation from other factors which affect the Lya fraction (e.g. dust,\nISM kinematics), we study the luminosity and redshift-dependence of the Lya\nfraction over 3<z<6, when the IGM is known to be ionised. These results reveal\nthat low luminosity galaxies show strong Lya emission much more frequently than\nluminous systems, and that at fixed luminosity, the prevalence of strong Lya\nemission increases moderately with redshift over 3 < z < 6. Based on the\ncorrelation between blue UV slopes and strong Lya emitting galaxies in our\ndataset, we argue that the Lya fraction trends are governed by redshift and\nluminosity-dependent variations in the dust obscuration, with likely additional\ncontributions from trends in the kinematics and covering fraction of neutral\nhydrogen. We find a tentative decrease in the Lya fraction at z~7 based on the\nlimited IR spectra for candidate z~7 lensed LBGs, a result which, if confirmed\nwith future surveys, would suggest an increase in the neutral fraction by this\nepoch. Given the supply of z and Y-drops now available from Hubble WFC3/IR\nsurveys, we show it will soon be possible to significantly improve estimates of\nthe Lya fraction using optical and near-IR spectrographs, thereby extending the\nstudy conducted in this paper to 7<z<8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 23:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
