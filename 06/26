Unlike the jet\nemission, which requires post hoc modeling of the non-thermal electrons, the\nFaraday rotation measures (RMs) depend primarily upon simulated quantities and\nthus provide a robust way in which to confront simulations with observations.\nWe compute RM distributions of 3D global GRMHD jet formation simulations, with\nwhich we explore the dependence upon model and observational parameters,\nemphasizing the signatures of structures generic to the theory of MHD jets.\nWith typical parameters, we find that it is possible to reproduce the observed\nmagnitudes and many of the structures found in AGN jet RMs, including the\npresence of transverse RM gradients. In our simulations the RMs are generated\nwithin a smooth extension of the jet itself, containing ordered toroidally\ndominated magnetic fields. This results in a particular bilateral morphology\nthat is unlikely to arise due to Faraday rotation in distant foreground clouds.\nHowever, critical to efforts to probe the Faraday screen will be resolving the\ntransverse jet structure. Therefore, the RMs of radio cores may not be reliable\nindicators of the properties of the rotating medium.

However, such transmission\ncoefficients do not reproduce the barrier region of evaporation spectra and\nreproduction of the data requires a distributions of Coulomb barriers.

Secondly for heavy nuclei, an excitation-energy dependent\nlevel-density parameter is required to describe the slope of the exponential\ntails of these spectra. The level-density parameter was reduced at larger\ntemperatures, consistent with the expected fadeout of long-range correlation,\nbut the strong $A$ dependence of this effect is unexpected.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet. This model matches the overall spectrum shown by the Auger\ndata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function of\nparticle energy. We thus predict an observable anisotropy in the composition at\nhigh energy in the sense that lighter nuclei should preferentially be seen\ntoward the general direction of Cen A. Taking into consideration the magnetic\nfield models for the Galactic disk and a Galactic magnetic wind, this scenario\nmay resolve the discrepancy between HiRes and Auger results concerning the\nchemical composition of UHECRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 16:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The detection of these planets however\nrequires the removal of all false positives. Although many false positives can\nbe identified by a detailed analysis of the LCs, the detections of others\nrequire additional observations. An important source of false positives are\nfaint eclipsing binaries within the PSF of the target stars. We develop a new\nmethod that allows us to detect faint eclipsing binaries with a separation\nsmaller than one arcsec from target stars. We thereby focus on binaries that\nmimic the transits of terrestrial planets. These binaries can be either at the\nsame distance as the target star (triple stars), or at either larger, or\nsmaller distances. A close inspection of the problem indicates that in all\nrelevant cases the binaries are brighter in the infrared than in the optical\nregime. We show how high resolution IR spectroscopy can be used to remove these\nfalse positives. For the triple star case, we find that the brightness\ndifference between a primary and an eclipsing secondary is about 9-10 mag in\nthe visual but only about 4.5-5.9 magnitudes in the K-band. We demonstrate how\nthe triple star hypothesis can be excluded by taking a high-resolution IR\nspectrum. Simulations of these systems show that the companions can be detected\nwith a false-alarm probability of 2%, if the spectrum has a S/N-ratio > 100. We\nshow that high-resolution IR spectra also allows to detect most of the false\npositives caused by foreground or background binaries. If high resolution IR\nspectroscopy is combined with photometric methods, virtually all false\npositives can be detected without RV measurements.

The larger group is defined by the assumption that all\nobservers will agree whether any given quantity is conserved. Alternatively,\nand equivalently, it is defined by the assumption that all observers will agree\nthat the general relativistic wave equation describes the propagation of light.\nThus, the group replacement is analogous to the replacement of the Lorentz\ngroup by the diffeomorphisms that led Einstein from special relativity to\ngeneral relativity, and is also consistent with the assumption of constant\nlight velocity that led him to special relativity. The enlarged covariance\ngroup leads to a non-commutative geometry based not on a manifold, but on a\nnonlocal space in which paths, rather than points, are the most primitive\ninvariant entities. This yields a theory which unifies the gravitational and\nelectroweak interactions.

However the\ntransition between normothermia and hypothermia during haemorrhagic shock has\nrarely been systematically quantified from intensive time series data. We\nestimated the critical transition point (CTP) and provided confidence intervals\nfor core body temperature response to acute severe haemorrhage in a conscious\nrat model. Estimates were obtained by traditional piecewise linear regression\n(broken stick model) and compared to those from the more novel bent cable\nregression. Bent cable regression relaxes the assumption of an abrupt point\ntransition, and thus allows the capture of a potentially gradual transition\nphase; the broken stick is a special case of the bent cable model. We\ncalculated two types of confidence intervals, assuming either independent or\nautoregressive structure for the residuals. In spite of the severity of the\nhaemorrhage, median temperature change was minor (0.8 C; IQR 0.57-1.31 C) and\nonly four of 38 rats were clinically hypothermic (core temperature < 35 C).\nHowever, a transition could be estimated for 23 rats. Bent cable fits were\nsuperior when the transition appeared to be gradual rather than abrupt. In all\ncases, assuming independence gave incorrect uncertainty estimates of CTP. For\n15 animals, neither model could be fitted because of irregular temperature\nprofiles that did not conform to the assumption of a single transition.\nArbitrary imposition of broken stick fits on a gradual transition profile and\nassuming independent rather than autocorrelated error may result in misleading\nestimates of CTP.

These\nmaps, coupled with multi-band imaging on 4-meter-class optical telescopes, have\nyielded a sample of 23 galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.118 and 1.066.\nOf these 23 clusters, 10 are newly discovered. The selection of this sample is\napproximately mass limited and essentially independent of redshift. We provide\noptical positions, images, redshifts and X-ray fluxes and luminosities for the\nfull sample, and X-ray temperatures of an important subset. The mass limit of\nthe full sample is around 8e14 Msun, with a number distribution that peaks\naround a redshift of 0.4. For the 10 highest significance SZE-selected cluster\ncandidates, all of which are optically confirmed, the mass threshold is 1e15\nMsun and the redshift range is 0.167 to 1.066. Archival observations from\nChandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT provide X-ray luminosities and temperatures that\nare broadly consistent with this mass threshold. Our optical follow-up\nprocedure also allowed us to assess the purity of the ACT cluster sample.\nEighty (one hundred) percent of the 148 GHz candidates with signal-to-noise\nratios greater than 5.1 (5.7) are confirmed as massive clusters. The reported\nsample represents one of the largest SZE-selected sample of massive clusters\nover all redshifts within a cosmologically-significant survey volume, which\nwill enable cosmological studies as well as future studies on the evolution,\nmorphology, and stellar populations in the most massive clusters in the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2010 10:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2010 18:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}

In this letter we study spin-1/2 and\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and find that\nthe condensate wave function will develop non-trivial structures. From\nnumerical simulation we have identified two different phases. In one phase the\nground state is a single plane wave, and often we find the system splits into\ndomains and an array of vortices plays the role as domain wall. In this phase,\ntime-reversal symmetry is broken. In the other phase the condensate wave\nfunction is a standing wave and it forms spin stripe. The transition between\nthem is driven by interactions between bosons. We also provide an analytical\nunderstanding of these results and determines the transition point between the\ntwo phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2010 14:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 12:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 12:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 14:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}
