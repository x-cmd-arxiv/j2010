Motivated by the outflows observed in ultracompact binaries, we\ninvestigate whether magnetically coupled winds could in fact lead to\nsubstantial additional angular momentum losses. We remark that the scaling\nrelations often invoked for the relative importance of gravitational and\nmagnetic braking do not apply, and instead use simple non-empirical expressions\nfor the braking rates. In order to remove significant angular momentum, the\nwind must be tied to field lines anchored in one of the binary's component\nstars; uncertainties remain as to the driving mechanism for such a wind. In the\ncase of white dwarf accretors, we find that magnetic braking can potentially\nremove angular momentum on comparable or even shorter timescales than\ngravitational waves over a large range in orbital period. We present such a\nsolution for the 17-minute binary AM CVn itself which admits a cold white dwarf\ndonor and requires that the accretor have surface field strength ~6E4 G. Such a\nfield would not substantially disturb the accretion disk. Although the\ntreatment in this paper is necessarily simplified, and many conditions must be\nmet in order for a wind to operate as proposed, it is clear that magnetic\nbraking cannot easily be ruled out as an important angular momentum sink.

None of the 5\ntransitional disks in the sample show detectable gaseous molecular emission\nwith Spitzer upper limits at the 1% level in terms of line-to-continuum ratios\n(apart from H2).

In particular, we aim to maximize the throughput\nof the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the primary receivers\nbelow a certain threshold.\n  Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs may not have the luxury of knowing the\nchannel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key\nchallenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from primary\nreceivers. In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the\nsecondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels\nto the primary receivers. In particular, when complete CSI is not available,\nthe interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high\nprobability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to\ndeal with. Our contribution is fourfold. First, by analyzing the distributional\ncharacteristics of MIMO channels, we propose a unified homogeneous QCQP\nformulation that can be applied to all three scenarios. The homogeneous QCQP\nformulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation methods. Secondly, we show that the SDP relaxation admits no gap\nwhen the number of primary links is no larger than two. Thirdly, we propose a\nrandomized polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a near-optimal solution\nto the QCQP problem when there are more than two primary links. Finally, we\nshow that when the secondary transmitter has no CSI on the links to primary\nreceivers, the optimal solution to the QCQP problem can be found by a simple\nmatrix eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, which can be done much more\nefficiently than solving the QCQP directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 08:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 01:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-11"}

Thanks to a large body of research following the\nseminal work of Bianchi, WLAN throughput under saturated traffic condition has\nbeen well understood. By contrast, prior investigations on throughput\nperformance under unsaturated traffic condition was largely based on\nphenomenological observations, which lead to a common misconception that WLAN\ncan support a traffic load as high as saturation throughput, if not higher,\nunder non-saturation condition. In this paper, we show through rigorous\nanalysis that this misconception may result in unacceptable quality of service:\nmean packet delay and delay jitter may approach infinity even when the traffic\nload is far below the saturation throughput. Hence, saturation throughput is\nnot a sound measure of WLAN capacity under non-saturation condition. To bridge\nthe gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require finite mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively.\n  Our earlier work proved that in a WLAN with multi-packet reception (MPR)\ncapability, saturation throughput scales super-linearly with the MPR capability\nof the network. This paper extends the investigation to the non-saturation case\nand shows that super-linear scaling also holds for SBMD and SBDJ throughputs.\nOur results here complete the demonstration of MPR as a powerful\ncapacity-enhancement technique for WLAN under both saturation and\nnon-saturation conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 08:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-23"}

Within the\nframework of PACS photometer characterization, irradiation tests were performed\non a dedicated bolometer array in order to study long-term and short-term\nradiation effects. The main objective was to study particles impacts on the\ndetectors applicable to future observations in orbit and possible hard and/or\nsoft curing to restore its performances. Cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiations did\nnot show significant degradation, so we mainly focused on single events effects\n(SEE). Protons and alphas irradiations were then performed at the Van de Graaf\ntandem accelerator at the Institut de Physique Nucleaire (IPN, Orsay, France),\nrespectively at 20MeV and 30MeV. Observation showed that the shape of signal\nperturbations clearly depends on the location of the impacts either on the\ndetector itself or the read-out circuit. Software curing has then to be\nanticipated in order to deglitch the signal.

As is common with all random access protocols, the wireless channel is\noften under-utilized in MPR WLANs. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-round contention random-access protocol to address this problem. This\nwork complements the existing random-access methods that are based on\nsingle-round contention. In the proposed scheme, stations are given multiple\nchances to contend for the channel until there are a sufficient number of\n``winning\" stations that can share the MPR channel for data packet\ntransmission. The key issue here is the identification of the optimal time to\nstop the contention process and start data transmission. The solution\ncorresponds to finding a desired tradeoff between channel utilization and\ncontention overhead. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis to\ncharacterize the optimal strategy using the theory of optimal stopping. An\ninteresting result is that the optimal stopping strategy is a simple\nthreshold-based rule, which stops the contention process as soon as the total\nnumber of winning stations exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the\nconventional single-round contention protocol, the multi-round contention\nscheme significantly enhances channel utilization when the MPR capability of\nthe channel is small to medium. Meanwhile, the scheme automatically falls back\nto single-round contention when the MPR capability is very large, in which case\nthe throughput penalty due to random access is already small even with\nsingle-round contention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 10:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The orbital\nperiod is 0.126 days, the second longest period yet found for an eclipsing\nsdB+dM, but still close to the minimum 0.1-d period among such systems. The\nphase-folded light curve was used to detrend the orbital effects from the\ndataset, and the resulting amplitude spectrum shows a rich collection of\npulsation peaks spanning frequencies from ~50 to 4500 uHz. The presence of a\ncomplex pulsation spectrum in both the p-mode and the g-mode regions has never\nbeen seen before in a compact pulsator. Eclipsing sdB+dM stars are very rare,\nwith only seven systems known and only one with a pulsating primary. Pulsating\nstars in eclipsing binaries are especially important since they permit masses\nderived from seismological model fits to be cross checked with orbital mass\nconstraints.

In agreement with previous studies, we find that the\nkey role in high reactivity of RuO2(110) in ammonia decomposition is played by\nthe way in which, by promoting easier H abstraction, H bonding between ammonia\nand its intermediates with the adsorbate and substrate O converts NH\ndecomposition into a non-activated (spontaneous) process. Further, our findings\nconfirm in detail what experiment and previous studies have suggested about NO\nand N2 formation rates, namely, that NO desorption is a rate-limiting process\nin that surface NO blocks reaction sites at lower temperatures. Our\ncalculations concerning selectivity (93% in favor of NO over N2) are in very\nclose agreement with experiment (95%).

The significantly reduced N\ndiffusion caused by various intermediates present on the RuO2(110) surface\nseverely inhibits the recombination site for N+N -> N2, but interferes with\nthat for N + O -> NO far less owing to the nearby availability of O from\ndissociation of O2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 14:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 21:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

The RESPER probe is an induction device\nfor spectroscopy which performs simultaneous and non invasive measurements of\nthe electrical RESistivity 1/{\\sigma} and relative dielectric PERmittivity\n{\\epsilon}r of a subjacent medium. Numerical simulations establish that the\nRESPER can measure {\\sigma} and {\\epsilon} with inaccuracies below a predefined\nlimit (10%) up to the high frequency band (HF). Conductivity is related to\nsalinity and dielectric permittivity to volumetric water content using suitably\nrefined theoretical models which are consistent with the predictions of\nArchie's and Topp's empirical laws. The better the agreement, the lower the\nhygroscopic water content and the higher s; so closer agreement is found with\nconcrete containing almost no bonded water molecules provided these are\ncharacterized by a high {\\sigma}. A novelty of the present paper is the\napplication of a mathematical- physical model to the propagation of errors in\nthe measurements, based on a sensitivity functions tool. The inaccuracy of\nsalinity (water content) is the ratio (product) between the conductivity\n(permittivity) inaccuracy, specified by the probe, and the sensitivity function\nof salinity (water content) relative to conductivity (permittivity), derived\nfrom the constitutive equations of the medium. The main result is the model's\nprediction that the lower the inaccuracy for the measurements of s and\n{\\theta}W (decreasing by as much as an order of magnitude from 10% to 1%), the\nhigher {\\sigma}; so the inaccuracy for soil is lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 15:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2011 16:51:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2011 12:08:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 15:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 18:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

The\nmodel accounts for the rates at which dust is produced by collisions among\nunseen planetesimals, and the rate at which dust grains are destroyed due to\ncollisions. The model also accounts for the effects of radiation pressure,\nwhich is the dominant perturbation on the disk's smaller but abundant dust\ngrains. Solving the resulting system of rate equations then provides the dust\nabundances versus grain size and over time. Those solutions also provide the\ndust grains' collisional lifetime versus grain size, and the debris disk's\noptical depth and surface brightness versus distance from the star. Comparison\nto observations then yields estimates of the unseen planetesimal disk's radius,\nand the rate at which the disk sheds mass due to planetesimal grinding.\n  The model is then applied to optical observations of the edge-on dust disk\norbiting beta Pictoris, and good agreement is achieved when the unseen\nplanetesimal disk is broad, with 75<r<150 AU. If it is assumed that the dust\ngrains are bright like Saturn's icy rings, then the cross section of dust in\nthe disk is A_d~2x10^20 km^2 and its mass is M_d~11 lunar masses. In this case\nthe planetesimal disk's dust production rate is quite heavy, dM_d/dt~9\nearth-masses per Myr, implying that there is or was a substantial amount of\nplanetesimal mass there, at least 110 earth-masses. But if the dust grains are\ndarker than assumed, then the planetesimal disk's mass-loss rate and its total\nmass are heavier. In fact, the apparent dearth of any major planets in this\nregion, plus the planetesimal disk's heavy mass-loss rate, suggests that the\n75<r<150 AU zone at beta Pic might be a region of planetesimal destruction,\nrather than a site of ongoing planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 15:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
