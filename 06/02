In order to describe a continuum quantum field theory of Dirac\nfermions, lattice actions with purported exact chiral symmetry must break the\nflavor-singlet axial symmetry. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case by\nusing a minimally doubled fermion action. For simplicity we consider the\nAbelian axial anomaly in two dimensions. At finite lattice spacing and with\ngauge interactions, the axial anomaly arises from non-conservation of the\nflavor-singlet current. Similar non-conservation also leads to the axial\nanomaly in the case of the naive lattice action. For minimally doubled actions,\nhowever, fine tuning of the action and axial current is necessary to arrive at\nthe anomaly. Conservation of the flavor non-singlet vector current additionally\nrequires the current to be fine tuned. Finally we determine that the chiral\nprojection of a minimally doubled fermion action can be used to arrive at a\nlattice theory with an undoubled Dirac fermion possessing the correct anomaly\nin the continuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 16:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 00:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 17:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

The recent measurements of large offsets (~100 km/s)\nbetween the heliocentric radial velocities of some very massive (O2-type) field\nstars and the systemic LMC velocity provides a possible explanation of this\nenigma and suggests that the field stars are runaway stars ejected from their\nbirth places at the very beginning of their parent cluster's dynamical\nevolution. A straightforward way to prove this explanation is to measure the\nproper motions of the field stars and to show that they are moving away from\none of the nearby star clusters or OB associations. This approach however is\ncomplicated by the large distance to the LMC, which makes accurate proper\nmotion measurements difficult. We use an alternative approach for solving the\nproblem, based on the search for bow shocks produced by runaway stars. The\ngeometry of detected bow shocks would allow us to infer the direction of\nstellar motion and thereby to determine their possible parent clusters. In this\npaper we present the results of a search for bow shocks around six massive\nfield stars which were suggested in the literature as candidate runaway stars.\nUsing archival (Spitzer Space Telescope) data, we found a bow shock associated\nwith one of our program stars, the O2 V((f*)) star BI 237, which is the\nfirst-ever detection of bow shocks in the LMC. Orientation of the bow shock\nsuggests that BI 237 was ejected from the OB association LH 82 (located at ~120\npc in projection from the star). A by-product of our search is the detection of\nbow shocks generated by four OB stars in the field of the LMC and an arc-like\nstructure attached to the candidate luminous blue variable R81 (HD 269128). The\ngeometry of two of these bow shocks is consistent with the possibility that\ntheir associated stars were ejected from the 30 Doradus star forming complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 15:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

At 0.4<z<1.2 the match\nbetween the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-type\nspirals (Sb/Sc). At z=0 the new model shows a net improvement in comparison\nwith its original version of 2003, and in accord with recent observations in\nthe K band, the model Tully-Fisher also shows a morphological differentiation.\nHowever, in all bands the z=0 model Tully-Fisher is too bright. We argue that\nthis behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the model\ngalaxies at low redshifts. The star-formation rate declines too slowly, due to\ncontinuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed. An analysis of the\nmodel disk scale lengths, at odds with observations, hints to some missing\nphysics in the modeling of disk formation inside dark matter halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 00:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The reflected spectrum offers a unique possibility of observing the\nemission from the innermost regions of the system and probing the nature of\nsource I and its immediate surroundings. We obtained moderately high\nspectral-resolution (R~9000) observations of the near-infrared diffuse emission\nin several locations around source I/Orion-KL.

We investigate statistical equilibrium of Cr in the atmospheres of\nlate-type stars to show whether the systematic abundance discrepancy between Cr\nI and Cr II lines, as often encountered in the literature, is due to deviations\nfrom LTE.

Methods.\nNLTE calculations are performed for the model of Cr atom, comprising 340 levels\nand 6806 transitions in total. We make use of the quantum-mechanical\nphotoionization cross-sections of Nahar (2009) and investigate sensitivity of\nthe model to uncertain cross-sections for H I collisions. NLTE line formation\nis performed for the MAFAGS-ODF model atmospheres of the Sun and 10 metal-poor\nstars with -3.2 < [Fe/H] < -0.5, and abundances of Cr are derived by comparison\nof the synthetic and observed flux spectra.

By adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface helium\nabundance, $\\ysms= 0.2485\\pm0.0035$, and an uncertainty of 20% for the\ndiffusion rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, $\\yims$, is\n$0.278 \\pm 0.006$ independently of the reference standard solar models (and\nparticularly on adopted the solar abundances) used in the derivation of the\ncorrelation between $\\yim$ and $\\ysm$. When non-standard solar models with\nextra mixing are used, then we derive $\\yims = 0.273 \\pm 0.006$. In both cases,\nthe derived $\\yims$ value is higher than that directly derived from solar model\ncalibrations when the low metalicity solar abundances (e.g. by Asplund et al.)\nare adopted in the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 20:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The spectrum emitted by this plasma contains diagnostics\nthat have been used to determine the time since the disturbing event, although\nthis determination becomes uncertain as the elements in the plasma return to\nionization equilibrium. A general solution for the equilibrium timescale for\neach element arises from the elegant eigenvector method of solution to the\nproblem of a non-equilibrium plasma described by Masai (1984) and Hughes &\nHelfand (1985). In general the ionization evolution of an element Z in a\nconstant electron temperature plasma is given by a coupled set of Z+1 first\norder differential equations. However, they can be recast as Z uncoupled first\norder differential equations using an eigenvector basis for the system. The\nsolution is then Z separate exponential functions, with the time constants\ngiven by the eigenvalues of the rate matrix. The smallest of these eigenvalues\ngives the scale of slowest return to equilibrium independent of the initial\nconditions, while conversely the largest eigenvalue is the scale of the fastest\nchange in the ion population. These results hold for an ionizing plasma, a\nrecombining plasma, or even a plasma with random initial conditions, and will\nallow users of these diagnostics to determine directly if their best-fit result\nsignificantly limits the timescale since a disturbance or is so close to\nequilibrium as to include an arbitrarily-long time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 21:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Near the accretion shock, the density\nof the intracluster medium is very low and the Coulomb collisional timescale is\nlonger than the accretion timescale. Electrons and ions may not achieve\nequipartition in these regions. Numerical simulations have shown that the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich observables (e.g., the integrated Comptonization parameter\nY) for relaxed clusters can be biased by a few percent. The Y-mass relation can\nbe biased if non-equipartition effects are not properly taken into account.\nUsing a set of hydrodynamical simulations, we have calculated three potential\nsystematic biases in the Y-mass relations introduced by non-equipartition\neffects during the cross-calibration or self-calibration when using the galaxy\ncluster abundance technique to constraint cosmological parameters. We then use\na semi-analytic technique to estimate the non-equipartition effects on the\ndistribution functions of Y (Y functions) determined from the extended\nPress-Schechter theory. Depending on the calibration method, we find that\nnon-equipartition effects can induce systematic biases on the Y functions, and\nthe values of the cosmological parameters Omega_8, sigma_8, and the dark energy\nequation of state parameter w can be biased by a few percent. In particular,\nnon-equipartition effects can introduce an apparent evolution in w of a few\npercent in all of the systematic cases we considered. Techniques are suggested\nto take into account the non-equipartition effect empirically when using the\ncluster abundance technique to study precision cosmology. We conclude that\nsystematic uncertainties in the Y-mass relation of even a few percent can\nintroduce a comparable level of biases in cosmological parameter measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 22:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 03:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

Boundary conditions were\ngiven that were asymptotically invariant under the two-dimensional conformal\ngroup and that included a fall-off of the metric sufficiently slow to\nconsistently allow pp-wave type of solutions. Now, pp-waves can have two\ndifferent chiralities. Above the chiral point and at the chiral point, however,\nonly one chirality can be considered, namely the chirality that has the milder\nbehaviour at infinity. The other chirality blows up faster than AdS and does\nnot define an asymptotically AdS spacetime. By contrast, both chiralities are\nsubdominant with respect to the asymptotic behaviour of AdS spacetime below the\nchiral point. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions given in the earlier\ntreatment only included one of the two chiralities (which could be either one)\nat a time. We investigate in this paper whether one can generalize these\nboundary conditions in order to consider simultaneously both chiralities below\nthe chiral point. We show that this is not possible if one wants to keep the\ntwo-dimensional conformal group as asymptotic symmetry group. Hence, the\nboundary conditions given in the earlier treatment appear to be the best\npossible ones compatible with conformal symmetry. In the course of our\ninvestigations, we provide general formulas controlling the asymptotic charges\nfor all values of the topological mass (not just below the chiral point).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 00:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

Recent ATCA, XMM-Newton and MCELS observations of the Magellanic Clouds\n(MCs) cover a number of new and known SNRs which are poorly studied, such as\nSNR J0528-6714 . This particular SNR exhibits luminous radio-continuum\nemission, but is one of the unusual and rare cases without detectable optical\nand very faint X-ray emission (initially detected by ROSAT and listed as object\n[HP99] 498). We used new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and new\noptical observations at H{\\alpha}, [S ii] and [O iii] wavelengths, in\ncombination with XMM-Newton X-ray data, to investigate the SNR properties and\nto search for a physical explanation for the unusual appearance of this SNR.\n  Methods.

We present the results of new moderate resolution ATCA observations\nof SNR J0528-6714. We found that this object is a typical older SNR with a\nradio spectral index of {\\alpha}=-0.36 \\pm 0.09 and a diameter of D=52.4 \\pm\n1.0 pc.

The low temperature, low surface brightness,\nand large extent of the remnant all indicate a relatively advanced age. The\nnear circular morphology indicates a Type Ia event.\n  Conclusions. Our study revealed one of the most unusual cases of SNRs in the\nLocal Group of galaxies - a luminous radio SNR without optical counterpart and,\nat the same time, very faint X-ray emission. While it is not unusual to not\ndetect an SNR in the optical, the combination of faint X-ray and no optical\ndetection makes this SNR very unique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 03:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Using the recent measurements\nof the robust metallicity indicators Zn and S in DLAs and sub-DLAs, we confirm\nthat sub-DLAs have higher mean metallicities than DLAs, especially at $z\n\\lesssim 2$. We find that the intercept of the metallicity-redshift relation\nderived from Zn and S is higher than that derived from Fe by 0.5-0.6 dex. We\nalso show that, while there is a correlation between the metallicity and the\nrest equivalent width of Mg II $\\lambda 2796$ or Fe II $\\lambda 2599$ for DLAs,\nno correlation is seen for sub-DLAs. Given this, and the similar Mg II or Fe II\nselection criteria employed in the discovery of both types of systems at lower\nredshifts, the difference between metallicities of DLAs and sub-DLAs appears to\nbe real and not an artefact of selection. This conclusion is supported by our\nsimulations of Mg II $\\lambda 2796$ and Fe II $\\lambda 2599$ lines for a wide\nrange of physical conditions. On examining the velocity spreads of the\nabsorbers, we find that sub-DLAs show somewhat higher mean and median velocity\nspreads ($\\Delta v$), and an excess of systems with $\\Delta v > 150$ km\ns$^{-1}$, than DLAs. Compared to DLAs, the [Mn/Fe] vs. [Zn/H] trend for\nsub-DLAs appears to be steeper and closer to the trend for Galactic bulge and\nthick disk stars, possibly suggesting different stellar populations. The\nabsorber data appear to be consistent with galaxy down-sizing. The data are\nalso consistent with the relative number densities of low-mass and high-mass\ngalaxies.

It has been argued that in several protostellar systems such a wind\ntransports a significant fraction of the angular momentum from at least some\npart of the disc. We model this case by considering a radially localized disc\nmodel in which the matter is well coupled to the field and the wind is the main\nrepository of excess angular momentum. We consider stationary solutions in\nwhich magnetic diffusion counters the shearing and advection of the field\nlines. In Wardle & K\\\"onigl we analysed the disc structure in the hydrostatic\napproximation and presented disc/wind solutions for the ambipolar diffusivity\nregime. In K\\\"onigl, Salmeron & Wardle (Paper I) we generalized the hydrostatic\nanalysis to the Hall and Ohm diffusivity domains and identified the parameter\nsub-regimes in which viable solutions occur. In this paper we test these\nresults by deriving numerical solutions (integrated through the sonic critical\nsurface) of the disc equations in the Hall domain. We confirm the predictions\nof the hydrostatic analysis and demonstrate its usefulness for clarifying the\nbehaviour of the derived solutions. We show that the solutions can be extended\nto larger scales (so that they also cross the Alfv\\'en critical surface) by\nmatching the localized disc solutions to global wind solutions of the type\nintroduced by Blandford & Payne. To facilitate this matching, we construct a\nlibrary of wind solutions, which is made available to the community. The\nresults presented in Wardle & K\\\"onigl, Paper I and this work form a\ncomprehensive framework for the study of wind-driving accretion discs in\nprotostellar and other astrophysical environments.

It is known\nthat this problem is inherently unstable against noise, and to overcome this\ninstability, the authors of [Stable Recovery; Donoho et.al., 2006] have\nproposed to use an \"approximate\" decomposition, that is, a decomposition\nsatisfying ||x - A s|| < \\delta, rather than satisfying the exact equality x =\nAs. Then, they have shown that if there is a decomposition with ||s||_0 <\n(1+M^{-1})/2, where M denotes the coherence of the dictionary, this\ndecomposition would be stable against noise. On the other hand, it is known\nthat a sparse decomposition with ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2 is unique. In other\nwords, although a decomposition with ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2 is unique, its\nstability against noise has been proved only for highly more restrictive\ndecompositions satisfying ||s||_0 < (1+M^{-1})/2, because usually (1+M^{-1})/2\n<< spark(A)/2.\n  This limitation maybe had not been very important before, because ||s||_0 <\n(1+M^{-1})/2 is also the bound which guaranties that the sparse decomposition\ncan be found via minimizing the L1 norm, a classic approach for sparse\ndecomposition. However, with the availability of new algorithms for sparse\ndecomposition, namely SL0 and Robust-SL0, it would be important to know whether\nor not unique sparse decompositions with (1+M^{-1})/2 < ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2\nare stable. In this paper, we show that such decompositions are indeed stable.\nIn other words, we extend the stability bound from ||s||_0 < (1+M^{-1})/2 to\nthe whole uniqueness range ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2. In summary, we show that \"all\nunique sparse decompositions are stably recoverable\".

Counting rate and energy flux upper limits were computed for\nthose 36 pulsars for which no X-ray counterparts could be detected. Comparing\nthe X-ray and radio pulse profiles of PSR J1821-2452 in M28 and the 47 Tuc\npulsars PSR J0024-7204D,O,R indicated some correspondence between both\nwavebands. The X-ray efficiency of the globular cluster millisecond pulsars was\nfound to be in good agreement with the efficiency Lx ~ 10^-3 Edot observed in\nGalactic field rotation-powered pulsars. Millisecond pulsars in the galactic\nplane and in globular clusters appear to show no distinct differences in their\nX-ray emission properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 09:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-03"}

In these calculations, infrared spectroscopy\nmethods proved to be an effective tool for study of the main properties of\nelectron interaction with polar long-wavelength TO phonons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 12:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We find following interesting behaviour just before and after\nthe nulls: (i) The pulsar's intensity does not switch off abruptly at the null,\nbut fades gradually, taking ~ 10 P1. Just after nulls intensity rises to a\nmaximum over a short (less than one period) time scale. (ii) While the last\nactive pulses before nulls are dimmer, the first few active pulses just after\nnulls outshine normal ones. This effect is very clear for inner region of\npulsar profile, where mean intensity of last few active pulses just after nulls\nis ~ 2.8 times more than that for last active pulses just before nulls. (iii)\nThere is a significant evolution of shape of the pulsar's profile, around\nnulls, especially at beginning of bursts: an enhanced bump of intensity in\ninner region, a change in ratio of strengths of the leading and trailing peaks\ntowards a more symmetric profile, an increase in profile width of about 10%,\nand a shift of profile centre towards later longitudes. (iv) Just before nulls,\nthe apparent drift rate becomes slower, transitioning to an almost phase\nstationary drift pattern. Further, when the pulsar comes out of null, the\nincreased intensity is very often accompanied by what looks like a disturbed\ndrift rate behaviour, which settles down to the regular drift pattern as the\npulsar intensity returns to normal. Thus, we find some very specific and well\ncorrelated changes in the radio emission properties of PSR B0818-41 when the\nemission restarts after a null. These could imply that the phenomenon of\nnulling is associated with some kind of a \"reset\" of the pulsar radio emission\nengine. We also present plausible explanations for some of the observed\nbehaviour, using the Partially Screened Gap model of the inner pulsar\naccelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 13:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We prove that as sets these fractals arise\nas boundaries of functions in closed subspaces of the Hardy space $H^2$. By\nthis we mean that there are lacunary subsets $\\Gamma$ of the non-negative\nintegers, and associated closed $\\Gamma$-subspace in the Hardy space\n$H^2(\\bd)$, $\\bd$ denoting the disk, such that for every function $f$ in in\n$H^2(\\Gamma)$, and for every point $z$ in $\\bd$, $f(z)$ admits a boundary\nintegral represented by an associated measure $\\mu$, with integration over\n$\\supp{\\mu}$ placed as a Cantor subset on the circle $\\bt := \\{bd}(\\bd)$.\n  We study families of pairs: measures $\\mu$ and sets $\\Gamma$ of lacunary\nform, admitting lacunary Fourier series in $L^2(\\mu)$; i.e., configurations\n$\\Gamma$ arranged with a geometric progression of empty spacing, or missing\nparts, gaps. Given $\\Gamma$, we find corresponding generalized Szeg\\\" o kernels\n$G_\\Gamma$, and we compare them to the classical Szeg\\\" o kernel for $\\bd$.\nRather than the more traditional approach of starting with $\\mu$, and then\nasking for possibilities for sets $\\Gamma$, such that we get Fourier series\nrepresentations, we turn the problem upside down; now starting instead with a\ncountably infinite discrete subset $\\Gamma$, and, within a new duality\nframework, we study the possibilities for choices of measures $\\mu$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 15:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 15:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-24"}
