Just as\nclassical error-correcting codes are indispensible in today's information\ntechnologies, it is believed that QECC will play a similarly crucial role in\ntomorrow's quantum information systems. Here, we report on the first\nexperimental demonstration of a quantum erasure-correcting code that overcomes\nthe devastating effect of photon losses. Whereas {\\it errors} translate, in an\ninformation theoretic language, the noise affecting a transmission line, {\\it\nerasures} correspond to the in-line probabilistic loss of photons. Our quantum\ncode protects a four-mode entangled mesoscopic state of light against erasures,\nand its associated encoding and decoding operations only require linear optics\nand Gaussian resources. Since in-line attenuation is generally the strongest\nlimitation to quantum communication, much more than noise, such an\nerasure-correcting code provides a new tool for establishing quantum optical\ncoherence over longer distances. We investigate two approaches for\ncircumventing in-line losses using this code, and demonstrate that both\napproaches exhibit transmission fidelities beyond what is possible by classical\nmeans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2010 16:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

Hence, it is possible to understand, without\nfine-tuning, the very small current value of the CC as compared to its\ntheoretically expected large value in quantum field theory and string theory.\nIn our framework, this relaxation appears as a pure gravitational effect, where\nno ad hoc scalar fields are needed. The action involves a positive power of a\ncharacteristic mass parameter, M, whose value can be, interestingly enough, of\nthe order of a typical particle physics mass of the Standard Model of the\nstrong and electroweak interactions or extensions thereof, including the\nneutrino mass. The model universe emerging from this scenario (the \"Relaxed\nUniverse\") falls within the class of the so-called LXCDM models of the cosmic\nevolution. Therefore, there is a \"cosmon\" entity X (represented by an effective\nobject, not a field), which in this case is generated by the effective\nfunctional and is responsible for the dynamical adjustment of the cosmological\nconstant. This model universe successfully mimics the essential past epochs of\nthe standard (or \"concordance\") cosmological model (LCDM). Furthermore, it\nprovides interesting clues to the coincidence problem and it may even connect\nnaturally with primordial inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2010 17:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2010 18:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

These studies were\nperformed for different dimensions of the detector, distances of propagation,\nand strengths of the atmospheric turbulence.

This\napproach results in a significant compensation of the beam wandering which in\nmany cases is the main contributor to the SI. A novel method is to generate the\nPCBs by combining two laser beams - Gaussian and vortex beams, with different\nfrequencies (the difference between these two frequencies being significantly\nsmaller than the frequencies themselves).

In this work a simple physical model is proposed for\nbiological cell division. The model consists of a positive ionic gradient\nacross the cell membrane, and concentration of charge at the nodes of the\nspindle and on the chromosomes. A simple calculation, based on Coulomb's Law,\nshows that under such circumstances a chromosome will tend to break up to its\nconstituent chromatids and that the chromatids will be separated by a distance\nthat is an order of thirty percent of the distance between the spindle nodes.\nFurther repulsion between the nodes will tend to stretch the cell and\neventually break the cell membrane between the separated chromatids, leading to\ncell division. The importance of this work is in continuing the understanding\nof the electromagnetic basis of cell division and providing it with an\nanalytical model. A central implication of this and other studies is to give\ntheoretical support to the notion that cell division can be manipulated by\nelectromagnetic means.

Deviations from\nperfect periodicity, for example due to thermal motion of the atoms, reduces\nthe intensity of the Bragg peaks as well as produces structure in the diffuse\nscattering background. Analysis of the thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) had\nbeen used to determine interatomic force constants and phonon dispersion in\nrelatively simple cases before inelastic neutron scattering became the\npreferred technique to study lattice dynamics. With the advent of intense\nsynchrotron x-ray sources, there was a renewed interest in TDS for measuring\nphonon dispersion. The relatively short x-ray pulses emanating from these\nsources also enables the measurement of phonon dynamics in the time domain.\nPrior experiments on nonequilibrium phonons were either limited by\ntime-resolution and/or to relatively long wavelength excitations. Here we\npresent the first images of nonequilibrium phonons throughout the Brillouin\nzone in photoexcited III-V semiconductors, indium-phosphide and\nindium-antimonide, using picosecond time-resolved diffuse scattering.

We investigated\nevaporation of $\\mu$m-sized silicate particles heated by a bow shock produced\nby a planetesimal orbiting in the gas in the early solar nebula and\ncondensation of crystalline silicate from the vapor thus produced. Our\nnumerical simulation of shock-wave heating showed that these {\\mu}m-sized\nparticles evaporated almost completely when the bow shock is strong enough to\ncause melting of chondrule precursor dust particles. We found that the silicate\nvapor cools very rapidly with expansion into the ambient unshocked nebular\nregion; the cooling rate is estimated, for instance, to be as high as 2000 K\ns$^{-1}$ for a vapor heated by a bow shock associated with a planetesimal of\nradius 1 km. The rapid cooling of the vapor leads to nonequilibrium gas-phase\ncondensation of dust at temperatures much lower than those expected from the\nequilibrium condensation. It was found that the condensation temperatures are\nlower by a few hundred K or more than the equilibrium temperatures. This\nexplains the results of the recent experimental studies of condensation from a\nsilicate vapor that condensation in such large supercooling reproduces\nmorphologies similar to those of silicate crystals found in meteorites.

In the so-called Chakrabarti-Titarchuk scenario, the Keplerian\ncomponent supplies low energy (soft) photons while the sub-Keplerian component\nsupplies hot electrons which exchange their energy with the soft photons\nthrough Comptonization or inverse Comptonization processes. In the\nsub-Keplerian component, a shock is generally produced due to the centrifugal\nforce. The postshock region is known as the CENtrifugal pressure-supported\nBOundary Layer (CENBOL). In this paper, we compute the effects of the thermal\nand the bulk motion Comptonization on the soft photons emitted from a Keplerian\ndisk by the CENBOL, the preshock sub-Keplerian disk and the outflowing jet. We\nstudy the emerging spectrum when the converging inflow and the diverging\noutflow (generated from the CENBOL) are simultaneously present. From the\nstrength of the shock, we calculate the percentage of matter being carried away\nby the outflow and determine how the emerging spectrum depends on the outflow\nrate. The preshock sub-Keplerian flow is also found to Comptonize the soft\nphotons significantly. The interplay between the up-scattering and\ndown-scattering effects determines the effective shape of the emerging\nspectrum. By simulating several cases with various inflow parameters, we\nconclude that whether the preshock flow, or the postshock CENBOL or the\nemerging jet is dominant in shaping the emerging spectrum depends strongly on\nthe geometry of the flow and the strength of the shock in the sub-Keplerian\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 10:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-22"}

In particular, a connection between the most long-lived\nresonances and certain periodic orbits is established experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 14:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-25"}

With the help of the extended Press-Schechter formalism,\nwe evaluate analytically the rates of merging of the first star-forming halos\ninto zero-dimensional larger halos and one-dimensional first filaments. It is\nshown that as the neutrino mass fraction f_{\\nu} increases, the\nhalo-to-filament merging rate increases while the halo-to-halo merging rate\ndecreases sharply. For f_{\\nu}<=0.04, the halo-to-filament merging rate is\nnegligibly low at all filament mass scales, while for f_{\\nu}>=0.07 the\nhalo-to-filament merging rate exceeds 0.1 at the characteristic filament mass\nscale of ~10^{9}M_sun. The distribution of the redshifts at which the first\nfilaments ultimately collapse along their longest axes is derived and found to\nhave a sharp maximum at z~8. We also investigate the formation and evolution of\nthe second generation filaments which contain the first galaxies of mass\n10^{9}M_sun at z=8 as the parent of the first generation filaments. A similar\ntrend is found: For f_{\\nu}>= 0.07 the rate of clustering of the first galaxies\ninto the second-generation filaments exceeds 0.3 at the characteristic mass\nscale of ~10^{11}M_sun. The longest-axis collapse of these second-generation\nfilaments are found to occur at z~3. The implications of our results on the\nformation of massive high-z galaxies and the early metal enrichment of the\nintergalactic media by supernova-driven outflows, and possibility of\nconstraining the neutrino mass from the mass distribution of the high-z central\nblackholes are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 15:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2011 23:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A task generates jobs that can be\ngiven arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains\nrewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this\nmodel is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing\nreward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these\nmodels, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim\nto fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers\nbetter fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive\na necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward\nrequirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility\noptimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy\nto be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition\ncan serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains\na greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility\noptimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation\nbound for the policy under general cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 01:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06"}
