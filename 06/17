Usually a Chapman-Enskog analysis is performed, either on the\ncontinuous Boltzmann system, or its discrete velocity counterpart. Separately a\ndiscrete time approximation is introduced to the discrete velocity Boltzmann\nsystem, to achieve a practically useful approximation to the continuous system,\nfor use in computation. Thereafter, with some additional arguments, the\ndynamics of the Chapman-Enskog expansion are linked to the discrete time system\nto produce the dynamics of the completely discrete scheme. In this paper we put\nforward a different route to the macroscopic dynamics. We begin with the system\ndiscrete in both velocity space and time. We hypothesize that the alternating\nsteps of advection and relaxation, common to all lattice Boltzmann schemes,\ngive rise to a slow invariant manifold. We perform a time step expansion of the\ndiscrete time dynamics using the invariance of the manifold. Finally we\ncalculate the dynamics arising from this system. By choosing the fully discrete\nscheme as a starting point we avoid mixing approximations and arrive at a\ngeneral form of the microscopic dynamics up to the second order in the time\nstep. We calculate the macroscopic dynamics of two commonly used lattice\nschemes up to the first order, and hence find the precise form of the deviation\nfrom the Navier-Stokes equations in the dissipative term, arising from the\ndiscretization of velocity space. Finally we perform a short wave perturbation\non the dynamics of these example systems, to find the necessary conditions for\ntheir stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 16:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

Given an arbitrary set of such charges,\nthere is a generic result for sufficiently late times which corresponds to each\ncharge being surrounded by a field zone with negligible influence from the\nother charges. Furthermore, we explicitly find a static solution in the static\npatch adapted to a charge (implying no energy loss by the charge) which can be\nregularly extended beyond the horizon to the full de Sitter spacetime, and show\nthat any other solution decays at late times to this one. On the other hand,\nfor non-conformal scalar fields the inertial observers naturally associated\nwith spatially flat coordinates will see a non-vanishing flux far from the\nhorizon, which will fall off more slowly than the inverse square of the\ndistance for sufficiently light fields (m^2 + \\xi R < 5H^2/4) and give rise to\na total integrated flux that grows unboundedly with the radius. This can be\nqualitatively interpreted as a consequence of a classical parametric\namplification of the field generated by the charge due to the time-dependent\nbackground spacetime.

The problem,\ngenerically, has two types of intercomponent interactions of different\ncharacters. First, the condensates are interacting via a minimal coupling to\nthe same fluctuating gauge field. A second type of coupling is the direct\ndissipationless drag represented by a local intercomponent current-current\ncoupling term in the free energy functional. The interplay between these two\ntypes of interactions produces a number of physical effects not present in\npreviously investigated $U(1)\\times U(1)$ models with only one kind of\nintercomponent interaction. In this work, we present a study of the phase\ndiagram of a $U(1) \\times U(1)$ superconductor which includes both of these\ninteractions. We study phase transitions and two types of competing paired\nphases which occur in this general model: (i) a metallic superfluid phase\n(where there is order only in the gauge invariant phase difference of the order\nparameters), (ii) a composite superconducting phase where there is order in the\nphase sum of the order parameters which has many properties of a\nsingle-component superconductor but with a doubled value of electric charge. We\ninvestigate the phase diagram with particular focus on what we call \"preemptive\nphase transitions\". These are phase transitions {\\it unique to multicomponent\ncondensates with competing topological objects}. A sudden proliferation of one\nkind of topological defects may come about due to a fluctuating background of\ntopological defects in other sectors of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-12"}

The effect of BH accretion on gas\nin its host galaxy is modeled by depositing momentum at a rate ~ tau L/c into\nthe ambient gas, where L is the luminosity produced by accretion onto the BH\nand tau is the wavelength-averaged optical depth of the galactic nucleus to the\nAGN's radiation (a free parameter of our model). The accretion rate onto the BH\nis relatively independent of our subgrid accretion model and is instead\ndetermined by the BH's dynamical impact on its host galaxy: BH accretion is\nthus self-regulated rather than `supply limited.' We show that the final BH\nmass and total stellar mass formed during a merger are more robust predictions\nof the simulations than the time dependence of the star formation rate or BH\naccretion rate. In particular, the latter depend on the assumed interstellar\nmedium physics, which determines when and where the gas fragments to form star\nclusters; this in turn affects the fuel available for further star formation\nand BH growth. Simulations over a factor of ~ 30 in galaxy mass are consistent\nwith the observed M_BH-sigma relation for a mean optical depth of tau ~ 25.\nThis requires that most BH growth occur when the galactic nucleus is optically\nthick to far-infrared radiation, consistent with the hypothesized connection\nbetween ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and quasars. We find tentative\nevidence for a shallower M_BH-sigma relation in the lowest mass galaxies, sigma\n< 100 km/s. Our results demonstrate that feedback-regulated BH growth and\nconsistency with the observed M_BH-sigma relation do not require that BH\nfeedback terminate star formation in massive galaxies or unbind large\nquantities of cold gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Subsets of the channels are occupied in each of the local\nenvironments surrounding Alice and Bob, as well as in the global environment\nbetween them (Eve). In the absence of a common clock for the two parties, the\ngoal is to devise time-invariant (stationary) strategies minimizing the\nsynchronization time. This emerged from recent applications in discovery of\nwireless devices.\n  We model the problem as follows. There are $N$ channels, each of which is\nopen (unoccupied) with probability $p_1,p_2,q$ independently for Alice, Bob and\nEve respectively. Further assume that $N \\gg 1/(p_1 p_2 q)$ to allow for\nsufficiently many open channels. Both Alice and Bob can detect which channels\nare locally open and every time-slot each of them chooses one such channel for\nan attempted sync. One aims for strategies that, with high probability over the\nenvironments, guarantee a shortest possible expected sync time depending only\non the $p_i$'s and $q$.\n  Here we provide a stationary strategy for Alice and Bob with a guaranteed\nexpected sync time of $O(1 / (p_1 p_2 q^2))$ given that each party also has\nknowledge of $p_1,p_2,q$. When the parties are oblivious of these\nprobabilities, analogous strategies incur a cost of a poly-log factor, i.e.\\\n$\\tilde{O}(1 / (p_1 p_2 q^2))$.

The first step to reveal its nature is to detect the evolution of\ndark energy or to prove beyond doubt that the cosmological constant is indeed\nconstant. However, in the standard approach to cosmology, the Universe is\ndescribed by the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann models. Here we show that\nin the perturbed universe (even if perturbations vanish if averaged over\nsufficiently large scales) the distance-redshift relation is not the same as in\nthe unperturbed universe. This has a serious consequence when studying the\nnature of dark energy and, as shown here, can impair the analysis and studies\nof dark energy. The analysis is based on two methods: the linear lensing\napproximation and the non-linear Szekeres Swiss-Cheese model. The inhomogeneity\nscale is ~50 Mpc, and both models have the same density fluctuations along the\nline of sight. The comparison between linear and non-linear methods shows that\nnon-linear corrections are not negligible. When inhomogeneities are present the\ndistance changes by several percent. To show how this change influences the\nmeasurements of dark energy, ten future observations with 2% uncertainties are\ngenerated. It is shown the using the standard methods (i.e. under the\nassumption of homogeneity) the systematics due to inhomogeneities can distort\nour analysis, and may lead to a conclusion that dark energy evolves when in\nfact it is constant (or vice versa). Therefore, if future observations are\nanalysed only within the homogeneous framework then the impact of\ninhomogeneities (such as voids and superclusters) can be mistaken for evolving\ndark energy. Since the robust distinction between the evolution and\nnon-evolution of dark energy is the first step to understanding the nature of\ndark energy a proper handling of inhomogeneities is essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 00:15:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 22:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-21"}

In this\npaper, we show that similar results hold for constant-time approximation\nalgorithms in the bounded-degree model.

(ii) Using the oracle, we give a constant-time rounding scheme that\nachieves an approximation ratio coincident with the integrality gap of the\nbasic LP.

The hadronic\nemission from the lobes can be dominated in gamma-ray bands when the primary\nemission is not very bright. Proton synchrotron component arises at sub MeV\nband. The synchrotron emission radiated from secondary electron/positron pairs\nproduced via photo-meson cascade emerges in GeV-TeV energy ranges. These high\nenergy emission signatures provide a test for proton accelerations in young AGN\njets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 06:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-18"}

Many distributed systems are engineered to solve\nanalogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can\nachieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS,\ncomposed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN)\nfacilitates efficient search and response.

But many\nintermediate situations may occur on mobility dynamics or radio link\ninstability. In such cases, where the network frequently splits into evolving\nconnected groups, none of the conventional routing paradigms (DTN or MANET) are\nfully satisfactory. In this paper we propose HYMAD, a Hybrid DTN-MANET routing\nprotocol which uses DTN between disjoint groups of nodes while using MANET\nrouting within these groups. HYMAD is fully decentralized and only makes use of\ntopological information exchanges between the nodes. The strength of HYMAD lies\nin its ability to adapt to the changing connectivity patterns of the network.\nWe evaluate the scheme in simulation by replaying synthetic and real life\nmobility traces which exhibit a broad range of connectivity dynamics. The\nresults show that HYMAD introduces limited overhead and outperforms the\nmulti-copy Spray-and-Wait DTN routing protocol it extends, both in terms of\ndelivery ratio and delay.

While consuming\nenergy, we finally practically all the produced energy is dissipated as heat.\nAs the way of preventing the \"thermal death\" the author suggests that we should\ntransit to the thermocyclic power engineering based on using heat circulation\nand build \"cold storage plants\" which must collect the dissipated heat and\ntransform it into forms of energy necessary to mankind. As a rule the\ndissipated heat has low temperature gradients. For this reason the efficiency\nof \"cold storage plants\" of the classic type (with coolers) is too small and\ntherefore they cannot be used as the basis of thermocyclic power engineering.\nThis fact makes us consider the perpetual motion engines of the second kind.\nHaving analyzed (excessively) numerous formulations of the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, the author has concluded that the prohibition of these engines\nis groundless. From the author's point of view this prohibition is a\nconsequence of the following mistakes made by the founders of Thermodynamics.\n1. Having in mind the concept of non-exterminable phlogiston, S. Carnot made a\nconclusion that the heat does not disappear but is only transferred from a warm\nbody to a cold one and therefore a cooler is necessary for any thermal engine.\nHowever, today we know that while heat is consumed, it does disappear as heat\nand converts into other forms of energy. Hence, Carnot's argumentation is\nwrong. 2.The Entropy Increase Law is wrongly reduced to the Thermal Entropy\nIncrease \"Law\" while in Nature the Total Entropy Increase Law works. Due to\ngroundlessness of the Thermal Entropy Increase \"Law\", the thermal entropy can\ndecrease and a compensation of converting thermal energy into mechanical work\ncan be non-thermal. Therefore a cooler is not necessary for a thermal engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 11:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-18"}

We found a noticeable effect of\nnon-local exchange on the spin-polarization of the electronic ground state of\nZGNRs, compared to LDA and GGA-PW91 calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 12:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-12"}

Most of the studies carried out so far emphasize the crucial role of the\nperiodicity imposed by the light dark cycle in neuronal synchronization.\nNevertheless, heterogeneity as a natural and permanent ingredient of these\ncellular interactions is seemingly to play a major role in these biochemical\nprocesses. In this paper we use a model that considers the neurons of the\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus as chemically-coupled modified Goodwin oscillators, and\nintroduce non-negligible heterogeneity in the periods of all neurons in the\nform of quenched noise. The system response to the light-dark cycle periodicity\nis studied as a function of the interneuronal coupling strength, external\nforcing amplitude and neuronal heterogeneity. Our results indicate that the\nright amount of heterogeneity helps the extended system to respond globally in\na more coherent way to the external forcing. Our proposed mechanism for\nneuronal synchronization under external periodic forcing is based on\nheterogeneity-induced oscillators death, damped oscillators being more\nentrainable by the external forcing than the self-oscillating neurons with\ndifferent periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 12:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 14:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

Two programming techniques that may be\nused to pursue these goals in a persistent environment are type-safe linguistic\nreflection and hyper-programming. The first provides a mechanism by which the\nprogrammer can write generators that, when executed, produce new program\nrepresentations. This allows the specification of programs that are highly\ngeneric yet depend in non-trivial ways on the types of the data on which they\noperate. Genericity promotes software reuse which in turn reduces the amount of\nnew code that has to be written. Hyper-programming allows a source program to\ncontain links to data items in the persistent store. This improves program\nreliability by allowing certain program checking to be performed earlier than\nis otherwise possible. It also reduces the amount of code written by permitting\ndirect links to data in the place of textual descriptions. Both techniques\ncontribute to the understanding of the persistent environment through\nsupporting the implementation of store browsing tools and allowing source\nrepresentations to be associated with all executable programs in the persistent\nstore. This thesis describes in detail the structure of type-safe linguistic\nreflection and hyper-programming, their benefits in the persistent context, and\na suite of programming tools that support reflective programming and\nhyper-programming. These tools may be used in conjunction to allow reflection\nover hyper-program representations.

While this is reasonably well understood for the\nregions of the disk beyond about 1 AU, the structure of these disks inward of 1\nAU remains a puzzle. This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially\nresolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the\nphysics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to\nevaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become\npossible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner AU of\nprotoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These observations have\npartly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions\nand puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these\nregions is extremely challenging. In this review we give a rough overview of\nthe history and recent developments in this exciting field of astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 14:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We\nexplain this evidence as due to the fine multi-temperature structure of coronal\nloops. To this end, we model bundles of loops made of thin strands, each heated\nby short and intense heat pulses. For simplicity, we assume that the heat\npulses are all equal and triggered only once in each strand at a random time.\nThe pulse intensity and cadence are selected so as to have steady active region\nloops ($\\sim 3$ MK), on the average. We compute the evolution of the confined\nheated plasma with a hydrodynamic loop model. We then compute the emission\nalong each strand in several spectral lines, from cool ($\\leq 1$ MK), to warm\n($2-3$ MK) lines, detectable with Hinode/EIS, to hot X-ray lines. The strands\nare then put side-by-side to construct an active region loop bundle. We find\nthat in the warm lines ($2-3$ MK) the loop emission fills all the available\nimage surface. Therefore the emission appears quite uniform and it is difficult\nto resolve the single loops, while in the cool lines the loops are considerably\nmore contrasted and the region is less fuzzy. The main reasons for this effect\nare that, during their evolution, i.e. pulse heating and slow cooling, each\nstrand spends a relatively long time at temperatures around $2-3$ MK, and that\nit has a high emission measure during that phase, so the whole region appears\nmore uniform or smudged. We make the prediction that the fuzziness should be\nreduced in the hot UV and X-ray lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 15:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which\ntransport routes are acting on the whole flow.
