Application to\nboth inviscid and viscous stationary low compressibility accretion disc models\nin Close Binaries (CB) are shown. The investigation carried out in this paper\nis a consequence of the fact that a low compressibility modelling is crucial to\ncheck numerical reliability.\n  Results show that physical viscosity supports a well-bound accretion disc\nformation, despite the low gas compressibility, when a Gaussian-derived Kernel\n(from the Error Function) is assumed, in extended particle range - whose Half\nWidth at Half Maximum (HWHM) is fixed to a constant $h$ value - without any\nspatial restrictions on its radial interaction (hereinafter GASPHER). At the\nsame time, GASPHER ensures adequate particle interpolations at the boundary\nfree edges. Both SPH and adaptive SPH (hereinafter ASPH) methods lack accuracy\nif there are not constraints on the boundary conditions, in particular at the\nedge of the particle envelope: Free Edge (FE) conditions. In SPH, an\ninefficient particle interpolation involves a few neighbour particles; instead,\nin the second case, non-physical effects involve both the boundary layer\nparticles themselves and the radial transport.\n  Either in a regime where FE conditions involve the computational domain, or\nin a viscous fluid dynamics, or both, a GASPHER scheme can be rightly adopted\nin such troublesome physical regimes. Despite the applied low compressibiity\ncondition, viscous GASPHER model shows clear spiral pattern profiles\ndemonstrating the better quality of results compared to SPH viscous ones.\nMoreover a successful comparison of results concerning GASPHER 1D inviscid\nshock tube with analytical solution is also reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 16:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 14:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 10:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 08:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 06:15:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 09:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We present the first results of the unbiased spectral survey of\nthe L1157-B1 bowshock, obtained in the framework of the key program \"Chemical\nHerschel Surveys of Star Forming Regions\" (CHESS).

Indeed the absence of either neutral\nor ionised Compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic Fe K\nsignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretion\ndisc is absent in this source. Instead, the accretion disc could be truncated\nwith the inner regions perhaps replaced by a Compton-thin Radiatively\nInefficient Accretion Flow. Thus, the Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi) emission could\nboth originate in ionised material perhaps at the transition region between the\nhot, inner flow and the cold, truncated accretion disc on the order of 10^(3) -\n10^(4) gravitational radii from the black hole. The origin for the unresolved\nneutral Fe K_alpha emission is then likely to be further out, perhaps\noriginating in the optical BLR or a Compton-thin pc-scale torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 18:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

One recent way that has been used to reduce storage complexity has been to\nexploit probabilistic independence, but as we argue, full independence\nassumptions impose strong sparsity constraints on distributions and are\nunsuitable for modeling rankings. We identify a novel class of independence\nstructures, called \\emph{riffled independence}, encompassing a more expressive\nfamily of distributions while retaining many of the properties necessary for\nperforming efficient inference and reducing sample complexity. In riffled\nindependence, one draws two permutations independently, then performs the\n\\emph{riffle shuffle}, common in card games, to combine the two permutations to\nform a single permutation. Within the context of ranking, riffled independence\ncorresponds to ranking disjoint sets of objects independently, then\ninterleaving those rankings. In this paper, we provide a formal introduction to\nriffled independence and present algorithms for using riffled independence\nwithin Fourier-theoretic frameworks which have been explored by a number of\nrecent papers. Additionally, we propose an automated method for discovering\nsets of items which are riffle independent from a training set of rankings.

We also use near-IR spectroscopy of\nnine CFHQS quasars at z~6 to determine black hole masses. These are compared\nwith similar estimates for more luminous Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nquasars to investigate the relationship between black hole mass and quasar\nluminosity. We find a strong correlation between MgII FWHM and UV luminosity\nand that most quasars at this early epoch are accreting close to the Eddington\nlimit. Thus these quasars appear to be in an early stage of their life cycle\nwhere they are building up their black hole mass exponentially. Combining these\nresults with the quasar luminosity function, we derive the black hole mass\nfunction at z=6. Our black hole mass function is ~10^4 times lower than at z=0\nand substantially below estimates from previous studies. The main uncertainties\nwhich could increase the black hole mass function are a larger population of\nobscured quasars at high-redshift than is observed at low-redshift and/or a low\nquasar duty cycle at z=6. In comparison, the global stellar mass function is\nonly ~10^2 times lower at z=6 than at z=0. The difference between the black\nhole and stellar mass function evolution is due to either rapid early star\nformation which is not limited by radiation pressure as is the case for black\nhole growth or inefficient black hole seeding. Our work predicts that the black\nhole mass - stellar mass relation for a volume-limited sample of galaxies\ndeclines rapidly at very high redshift. This is in contrast to the observed\nincrease at 4<z<6 from the local relation if one just studies the most massive\nblack holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 19:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

AIMS: We investigate\nthe structure and stellar population of two large stellar condensations (knots\nA & B) along one of the faint optical \"jet-like\" tidal streams associated with\nthe spiral NGC 1097, with the goal of establishing their physical association\nwith the galaxy and their origin. METHODS: We use the VLT/FORS2 to get deep\nV-band imaging and low-resolution optical spectra of two knots along NGC 1097's\nnortheast \"dog-leg\" tidal stream. With this data, we explore their morphology\nand stellar populations. RESULTS: The FORS2 spectra show that the redshift of\nknot A (and perhaps of knot B) is consistent with that of NGC 1097. The FORS2\nphotometry shows that the two knots match very well the photometric scaling\nrelations of canonical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph). From the spectral\nanalysis we find that knot A is mainly composed of stars near G-type, with no\nsigns of ongoing star formation. Comparing its spectrum to a library of\nGalactic GC spectra, we find that the stellar population of this dSph-like\nobject is most similar to intermediate to metal rich GCs. We find moreover,\nthat the tidal stream shows an \"S\" shaped inflection as well as a pronounced\nstellar overdensity at knot A's position. This suggests that knot A is being\ntidally stripped, and populates the stellar stream with its stars. CONCLUSIONS:\nWe have discovered that two knots along NGC 1097's northeast tidal stream share\nmost of their spectral and photometric properties with ordinary dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies (dSph). Moreover, we find strong indications that the\n\"dog-leg\" tidal stream arise from the tidal disruption of knot A.

The magnetic effect, that\nhas been extensively studied, and the electric effect where an electron is\naffected by a time-dependent electric potential that is constant in the region\nwhere the electron is propagating, i.e., such that the electric field vanishes\nalong its trajectory. The Aharonov-Bohm effects imply such a strong departure\nfrom the physical intuition coming from classical physics that it is no wonder\nthat they remain a highly controversial issue, after more than fifty years. The\nexistence of electric Aharonov-Bohm effect, that has not been confirmed\nexperimentally, is a very controversial issue. In their 1959 paper Aharonov and\nBohm proposed an Ansatz for the solution to the Schroedinger equation in\nregions where there is a time-dependent electric potential that is constant in\nspace. It consists in multiplying the free evolution by a phase given by the\nintegral in time of the potential. The validity of this Ansatz predicts\ninterference fringes between parts of a coherent electron beam that are\nsubjected to different potentials. In this paper we prove that the exact\nsolution to the Schroedinger equation is given by the Aharonov-Bohm Ansatz up\nto an error bound in norm that is uniform in time and that decays as a constant\ndivided by the velocity. Our results give, for the first time, a rigorous proof\nthat quantum mechanics predicts the existence of the electric Aharonov-Bohm\neffect, under conditions that we provide.

The light curve is characterized by a short-duration\nanomaly near the peak and an overall asymmetry. We find that the peak anomaly\nis due to a binary companion to the primary lens and the asymmetry of the light\ncurve is explained by the parallax effect caused by the acceleration of the\nobserver over the course of the event due to the orbital motion of the Earth\naround the Sun. In addition, we detect evidence for the effect of the finite\nsize of the source near the peak of the event, which allows us to measure the\nangular Einstein radius of the lens system. The Einstein radius combined with\nthe microlens parallax allows us to determine the total mass of the lens and\nthe distance to the lens. We identify three distinct classes of degenerate\nsolutions for the binary lens parameters, where two are manifestations of the\npreviously identified degeneracies of close/wide binaries and positive/negative\nimpact parameters, while the third class is caused by the symmetric cycloid\nshape of the caustic.

For two\ntypical heterogeneous workload traces: parallel batch jobs and Web services,\nour experiments show that: a) in a private Cloud scenario, when the throughput\nis almost same like that of a dedicated cluster system, our solution decreases\nthe configuration size of a cluster by about 40%; b) in a public Cloud\nscenario, our solution decreases not only the total resource consumption, but\nalso the peak resource consumption maximally to 31% with respect to that of EC2\n+RightScale solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 00:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 23:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}

For the\ngraph being an infinite $k$-ary tree ($k \\ge 3$), we show that for any\ndeviation $D$ there is an initial configuration of chips such that after\nrunning the Propp model for a certain time there is a vertex with at least $D$\nmore chips than expected in the random walk model. However, to achieve a\ndeviation of $D$ it is necessary that at least $\\exp(\\Omega(D^2))$ vertices\ncontribute by being occupied by a number of chips not divisible by $k$ at a\ncertain time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 03:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-09"}

In\nagreement with previous studies, we find a zero temperature itinerant\nmetamagnetic transition, reflected in the discontinuous changes in\nmagnetization as well as in the hysteresis, from a paramagnetic (PM) metallic\nstate to a polarized quasi-ferromagnetic (QFM) state, at intermediate and large\ninteraction strength ($U$). The jump in magnetization vanishes smoothly with\ndecreasing interaction strength, and at a critical $U$, the transition becomes\ncontinuous. The region of `coexistence' of the PM and QFM solutions in the\nfield-$U$ plane obtained in this study agrees quantitatively with recent\nnumerical renormalization group calculations, thus providing an important\nbenchmark. We highlight the changes in dynamics and quasiparticle weight across\nthis transition. The effective mass increases sharply as the transition is\napproached, exhibiting a cusp-like singularity at the critical field,and\ndecreases with field monotonically beyond the transition. We conjecture that\nthe first order metamagnetic transition is a result of the competition between\nKondo screening, that tries to quench the local moments, and Zeeman coupling,\nwhich induces polarization and hence promotes local moment formation.

Originally invented as the description of\nthe cohomology of homogeneous spaces it has to be redesigned when applied to\nother generalized cohomology theories such as the equivariant, the quantum\ncohomology, K-theory, and cobordism. All this cohomology theories are different\ndeformations of the ordinary cohomology. In this note we show that there is in\nsome sense the universal deformation of Schubert calculus which produces the\nabove mentioned by specialization of the appropriate parameters. We build on\nthe work of Lerche Vafa and Warner. The main conjecture there was that the\nclassical cohomology of a hermitian symmetric homogeneous manifold is a Jacobi\nring of an appropriate potential. We extend this conjecture and provide a\nsimple proof. Namely we show that the cohomology of the hermitian symmetric\nspace is a Jacobi ring of a certain potential and the equivariant and the\nquantum cohomology and K-theory is a Jacobi ring of a particular deformation of\nthis potential. This suggests to study the most general deformations of the\nFrobenius algebra of cohomology of these manifolds by considering the versal\ndeformation of the appropriate potential. The structure of the Jacobi ring of\nsuch potential is a subject of well developed singularity theory. This gives a\npotentially new way to look at the classical, the equivariant, the quantum and\nother flavors of Schubert calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 06:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2011 08:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The HERA experiment recently provided\nprecise data for rho electroproduction, including all spin density matrix\nelements. From QCD, it is expected that such a process should factorize between\na hard (calculable) coefficient function, and hadronic (p and rho) matrix\nelements.

Within the kt-factorization approach (valid at large gamma* p\ninvariant mass), we evaluate the impact factor of the transition gamma* -> rhoT\ntaking into account the twist 3 contributions.

We calculate the\nspin excitations in a disordered spin-density wave phase, and show how disorder\nand/or applied magnetic fields lead to a slowing down of the dynamical spin\nfluctuations in agreement with neutron scattering and muon spin rotation (muSR)\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 08:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-17"}

One of the main reasons of that is the\ninfluence of electron interaction of electrons with interfaces between layers.\nFrom one hand, this interaction leads to the additional electron scattering and\nconductivity of multilayer may be noticeably less than specific conductivities\nof composing metals. From the other hand, the electron reflection from\ninterfaces in a strong magnetic field may results in considerable increasing of\nconducting properties in consequence of the static skin effect. Due to changing\nof electron trajectories after collisions with interfaces new types of periodic\nmotion in the magnetic field and therefore new size and resonance phenomena in\nhigh frequency fields appear. In thin normal layers on the superconducting\nsubstrate, changing of trajectories is due to Andreev reflection and resonance\neffects, which do not exist in normal multilayers, films, and bulk\nmonocrystals, take place. In multilayers consisting of ferromagnetic and\nnonmagnetic metals, the internal magnetic field in ferromagnetic layers must be\ntaken into account, if the Larmor radius in this field is comparable with the\nlayer thickness. Because of the mutual diffusion of metals, the kinetic\ncoefficients of multilayers are changed in time. The investigation of this\nchanging may be used for determination of diffusion coefficient for the bulk\nand grain-boundary diffusion. The effects, which have been analyzed\ntheoretically in this review, can be used for the obtaining information on the\nelectron interaction with interfaces in conducting multilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 09:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-09"}

In particular we investigate the role of\nturbulence, which is thought to ubiquitously accompany the collapse of\nhigh-redshift halos. We distinguish between two main cases: the birth of\nPopulation III.1 stars - those which form in the pristine halos unaffected by\nprior star formation - and the formation of Population III.2 stars - those\nforming in halos where the gas is still metal free but has an increased\nionization fraction. This latter case can arise either from exposure to the\nintense UV radiation of stellar sources in neighboring halos, or from the high\nvirial temperatures associated with the formation of massive halos, that is,\nthose with masses greater than 1e8 solar masses. We find that turbulent\nprimordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation in both cases, even for\nturbulence in the subsonic regime, i.e. for rms velocity dispersions as low as\n20 % of the sound speed. Contrary to our original expectations, fragmentation\nis more vigorous and more widespread in pristine halos compared to pre-ionized\nones. We therefore predict Pop III.1 stars to be on average of somewhat lower\nmass, and form in larger groups, than Pop III.2 stars. We find that fragment\nmasses cover over two orders of magnitude, indicating that the resulting\nPopulation III initial mass function was significantly extended in mass as\nwell. This prompts the need for a large, high-resolution study of the formation\nof dark matter minihalos that is capable of resolving the turbulent flows in\nthe gas at the moment when the baryons become self-gravitating.

The static\nspin susceptibility is evaluated by a sum-rule-conserving generalized\nmean-field approximation, while the self-energy is calculated in the\nmode-coupling approximation. The spectrum of spin excitations is studied in the\nunderdoped and optimally doped regions. The DSS reveals a resonance mode (RM)\nat the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q = \\pi(1,1) at low temperatures due to a\nstrong suppression of the damping of spin excitations.

These moonlets should migrate, due to their gravitational interaction\nwith the ring ; in fact, some orbital variation have been detected. The\nstandard theory of type I migration of planets in protoplanetary disks can't be\napplied to the ring system, as it is pressureless. Thus, we compute the\ndifferential torque felt by a moonlet embedded in a two-dimensional disk of\nsolid particles, with flat surface density profile, both analytically and\nnumerically. We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to\nexplain the observed variations of the propeller's orbit in Saturn's A-ring.\n  However, local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally\ngravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet. Our\nsimulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the\nobservations, depending on the parameters of the rings. We find that on time\nscales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated\nby stochastic effects (while the former, non-stochastic migration dominates\nafter ~ 10^{4-5} years). In that case, the migration rates provided by\nobservations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be\nof the order of 700 kg/m^2. The age of the propellers shouldn't exceed 1 to 100\nmillion years, depending on the dominant migration regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 14:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It is usually required that the methodology can detect life\nindependently from its composition or form, and that the chosen biological\nsignature points to a feature common to all living systems, as the presence of\nmetabolism. In this paper we evaluate the use of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)\nfor the detection of microbial life in situ. MFCs are electrochemical devices\noriginally developed as power electrical sources, and can be described as fuel\ncells in which the anode is submerged in a medium that contains microorganisms.\nThese microorganisms, as part of their metabolic process, oxidize organic\nmaterial releasing electrons that contribute to the electric current, which is\ntherefore proportional to metabolic and other redox processes. We show that\npower and current density values measured in MFCs using microorganism cultures\nor soil samples in the anode are much larger than those obtained using a medium\nfree of microorganisms or sterilized soil samples, respectively. In particular,\nwe found that this is true for extremophiles, usually proposed to live in\nextraterrestrial environments. Therefore, our results show that MFCs have the\npotential to be used to detect microbial life in situ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 15:21:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 01:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In our setup, the\noptimising players play bounded memory strategies and the imitators play\naccording to specifications given by automata. We present algorithmic results\non the eventual survival of types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 00:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-18"}
