The indices y, b-y, and c_1 are\nused with an established calibration to derive T_eff and to derive the gravity,\nlog g_BJ from the Balmer jump, throughout the pulsation cycle. By employing the\nequations for stellar structure, additional parameters can be derived.\nStroemgren photometry and its calibration in terms of T_eff and log g can be\nused to determine the run of R and the atmosphere pulsation velocity. We find\nthat the Balmer-line strengths are correlated with T_eff and that the strength\nof the Ca_ii K line correlates well with the radius of the star and thus the\npulsation-dependent density of the atmosphere. The density in the stellar\natmosphere fluctuates as indicated by the changes in the gravity log g_BJ,\nderived from c_1, between 2.3 and 4.5 dex. Also the Stroemgren metal index,\nm_1, fluctuates. We find a disagreement between log g(T,L,M), the gravity\ncalculated from T_eff, L, and the mass M,and the gravity log g_BJ. This can be\nused to reassess the mass and the absolute magnitude of an individual star.The\ncurves derived for the pulsational velocity V_pul differ from curves obtained\nfrom spectra needed to apply the Baade-Wesselink method; we think these\ndifferences are due to phase dependent differences in the optical depth levels\nsampled in continuum photometry and in spectroscopy.

It is\nknown that solving the sequence assembly problem exactly on a bi-directed de\nBruijn graph or a string graph is intractable. However finding a Shortest\nDouble stranded DNA string (SDDNA) containing all the k-long words in the reads\nseems to be a good heuristic to get close to the original genome. This problem\nis equivalent to finding a cyclic Chinese Postman (CP) walk on the underlying\nun-weighted bi-directed de Bruijn graph built from the reads. The Chinese\nPostman walk Problem (CPP) is solved by reducing it to a general bi-directed\nflow on this graph which runs in O(|E|2 log2(|V |)) time. In this paper we show\nthat the cyclic CPP on bi-directed graphs can be solved without reducing it to\nbi-directed flow.

We perform simulations\nof the tail in the 15-50 keV bandpass, as well as of the first part of the\nX-ray afterglow. This infers that: E_{tot}^{e^\\pm}=5.04x10^{51} erg,\nB=2.0x10^{-4}, E_{P-GRB}/E_{aft}~0.25, and <n_{cbm}>=3.33 particles/cm^3. These\nvalues are consistent with those of \"long duration\" GRBs. We interpret the\nobserved energy of the first hard emission by identifying it with the P-GRB\nemission. The remaining long soft tail indeed fulfills the Amati relation.\nPreviously classified as a short burst, GRB 071227 on the basis of our analysis\nperformed in the context of the fireshell scenario represents another example\nof a disguised short burst, after GRB 970228 and GRB 060614. Further\nconfirmation of this result is that the soft tail of GRB 071227 fulfills the\nAmati relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 17:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 14:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

All of the results also\napply to quantum channels: e.g., if $\\EC$ accurately transmits certain POVMs,\nthe complementary channel $\\FC$ will necessarily be noisy for certain other\nPOVMs. While the inequalities are valid for mixed states of tripartite systems,\nrestricting to pure states leads to the basis-invariance of the difference\nbetween the information about $a$ contained in $b$ and $c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 18:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2010 22:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 22:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2011 22:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2011 17:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Aided\nby optical broad-band and H-alpha imaging, we interpret the asymmetric features\nas being due to star formation within gas stripped from the galaxies by\ninteraction with the cluster environment. The selected objects display a range\nof structures from broad fan-shaped systems of filaments and knots\n(`jellyfish') to narrower and smoother tails extending up to 100 kpc in length.\nSome of the features have been discussed previously in the literature, while\nothers are newly identified here. As an ensemble, the candidate stripping\nevents are located closer to the cluster centre than other star-forming\ngalaxies; their radial distribution is similar to that of all cluster members,\ndominated by passive galaxies. The fraction of blue galaxies which are\nundergoing stripping falls from 40% in the central 500 kpc, to less than 5%\nbeyond 1 Mpc. We find that tails pointing away from (i.e. galaxies moving\ntowards) the cluster centre are strongly favoured (11/13 cases). From the small\nnumber of `outgoing' galaxies with stripping signatures we conclude that the\nstripping events occur primarily on first passage towards the cluster centre,\nand are short-lived compared to the cluster crossing time. Using infall\ntrajectories from simulations, the observed fraction of blue galaxies\nundergoing stripping can be reproduced if the events are triggered at a\nthreshold radius of ~1 Mpc and detectable for ~500 Myr. HST images are\navailable for two galaxies from our sample and reveal compact blue knots\ncoincident with UV and H-alpha emission, apparently forming stars within the\nstripped material.

An asymptotically exact\nanalysis of this effective field theory is made possible through the\ndevelopment of a renormalization group procedure for mixed fermion-boson\nsystems. Considerations on how to connect the AF_S and P_L phases lead to a\nglobal phase diagram, which not only puts into perspective the theory of local\nquantum criticality for antiferromagnetic heavy fermion metals, but also\nprovides the basis to understand the surprising recent experiments in\nchemically-doped as well as pressurized YbRh2Si2.

We also present analysis of the details of\nthis transition in the ONC. In particular we show that a gap in the photometric\nand spectral type distributions is centred on, and a change in the fractional\nX-ray luminosity and rotation rate distribution occurs approximately at, the\nposition of a peak in radiative core size as a function of mass. Whilst\nphotometric signatures of this transition are lost at ages over ~20 Myrs, we\nshow that changes in fractional X-ray luminosity and magnetic field\nconfiguration persist to older ages. Analysis of literature data show that the\nmass at which the change in fractional X-ray luminosity is observed decreases\nwith age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 20:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In light of these studies, this\npaper investigates wetting and spreading on reactive substrates when inertial\neffects are dominant using a thermodynamically derived, diffuse interface model\nof a binary, three-phase material. The liquid-vapor transition is modeled using\na van der Waals diffuse interface approach, while the solid-fluid transition is\nmodeled using a phase field approach. The results from the simulations\ndemonstrate an $O \\left( t^{-\\nicefrac{1}{2}} \\right)$ spreading rate during\nthe inertial regime and oscillations in the triple-line position when the metal\ndroplet transitions from inertial to diffusive spreading. It is found that the\nspreading extent is reduced by enhancing dissolution by manipulating the\ninitial liquid composition. The results from the model exhibit good qualitative\nand quantitative agreement with a number of recent experimental studies of\nhigh-temperature droplet spreading, particularly experiments of copper droplets\nspreading on silicon substrates. Analysis of the numerical data from the model\nsuggests that the extent and rate of spreading is regulated by the spreading\ncoefficient calculated from a force balance based on a plausible definition of\nthe instantaneous interface energies. A number of contemporary publications\nhave discussed the likely dissipation mechanism in spreading droplets. Thus, we\nexamine the dissipation mechanism using the entropy-production field and\ndetermine that dissipation primarily occurs in the locality of the triple-line\nregion during the inertial stage, but extends along the solid-liquid interface\nregion during the diffusive stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 21:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The abundances were derived\nby comparing synthetic spectra with high-resolution infrared spectra obtained\nwith the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope. The targeted stars\nare drawn from two regions of the Sgr trailing arm separated by 66 degrees (5\nstars) and 132 degrees (6 stars) from the main body of Sgr. The trailing arm\nprovides a more direct diagnostic of the chemical evolution of Sgr compared to\nthe extensively phase-mixed leading arm.\n  Within our restricted sample of ~2-3 Gyr old stars, we find that the stream\nmaterial exhibits a significant metallicity gradient of -(2.4\\pm0.3)x10^{-3}\ndex / degree (-(9.4\\pm1.1)x10^{-4} dex / kpc) away from the main body of Sgr.\nThe tidal disruption of Sgr is a relatively recently event. We therefore\ninterpret the presence of a metallicity gradient in the debris as indicative of\na similar gradient in the progenitor. The fact that such a metallicity gradient\nsurvived for almost a Hubble time indicates that the efficiency of radial\nmixing was very low in the Sgr progenitor.\n  No significant gradient is seen to exist in the [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio\nalong the trailing arm. Our results may be accounted for by a radial decrease\nin star formation efficiency and/or radial increase in the efficiency of\ngalactic wind-driven metal loss in the chemical evolution of the Sgr\nprogenitor. The [Ti/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios observed within the stream\nare distinct from those of the Galactic halo. We conclude that the fraction of\nthe intermediate to metal-rich halo population contributed by the recent\ndissolution (<3 Gyr) of Sgr-like dwarf galaxies can not be substantial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 22:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this model, each node $u$ is given an additional $D_u$\nedges, a degree chosen from a specified probability distribution. Each such\nedge from $u$ is linked to a random node at distance $r$ ahead in the ring with\nprobability proportional to $1/r$, a \"harmonic\" distance distribution of\ncontacts. Aspnes et al. (2002) have shown an $O(\\log^2 n / \\ell)$ bound on the\nexpected length of greedy routes in the case when each node is assigned exactly\n$\\ell$ contacts and, as a consequence of recent work by Dietzfelbinger and\nWoelfel (2009), this bound is known to be tight.

The calculations\nare initially made in the frequency domain and provide Fourier-harmonic modes\nfor the gauge-invariant master functions that satisfy inhomogeneous versions of\nthe Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations. These gravitational master equations\nhave specific singular sources containing both delta function and\nderivative-of-delta function terms. We demonstrate in this paper successful\napplication of the method of extended homogeneous solutions, developed recently\nby Barack, Ori, and Sago, to handle source terms of this type.

The interest in local\ntermination naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably\ninterested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of\ninputs for which a program terminates. Local termination will be also be of\ninterest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known\nto be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding\nrecursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the\nwell-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal\nof rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We\nalso describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems.\nThe resulting techniques for proving local termination have in some cases\nalready been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation\nof the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language. Previously this language\nhad already been found via a tedious analysis of the reduction behaviour of\nS-terms. These findings have now been vindicated by a fully automated and\nverified proof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 10:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 09:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

In general\nthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 M_sun, and\nluminous, with -25<M_K<-20. We find a strong correlation between the fraction\nof major mergers and L_IR, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being up\nto 50%. We also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with L_IR.\nMinor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity for\nsources with low luminosities. The precise fraction of mergers in any given\nL_IR bin varies by redshift due to sources at z>1 being difficult to classify\nand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers can\nonly be considered lower limits. At z<1, where the morphological\nclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ULIRG\npopulation (50-80%) and are important for the LIRG population (25-40%). At z>1\nthe fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ULIRGs. Although the\ngeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local\n(U)LIRGs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.\nThis is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at high\nredshift. We argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed and\nthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (U)LIRG\nphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals\n(<10^12 M_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 10:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements confirm this significant change\nin the interface morphology for the various doping levels. We demonstrate that\ndoping of ZnO is a tool to adjust the charge transport in ZnO/P3HT hybrids,\nusing one single injecting metal (Au bottom contact) on a SiO2 dielectric. We\nobserve an influence of the zinc oxide layer on the hole mobility in P3HT which\nwe can modify via Al doping of ZnO. Hence, maximum hole mobility of 5e-4\ncm^2/Vs in the hybrid system with 2 at.% Al doping. 5 at.% Al doping leads to a\nbalanced mobility in the organic/inorganic hybrid system but also to a small\non/off ratio due to high off-currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 12:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

Instead, X-ray observations often show decreasing\niron abundance toward galactic central regions, where the Ia SN enrichment is\nexpected to be the highest. We examine the cause of this missing iron problem\nby studying the enrichment process and its effect on X-ray abundance\nmeasurements of the hot gas. The evolution of Ia SN iron ejecta is simulated in\nthe context of galaxy-wide hot gas outflows, in both supersonic and subsonic\ncases, as may be expected for hot gas in galactic bulges or elliptical galaxies\nof intermediate masses. SN reverse-shock heated iron ejecta is typically found\nto have a very high temperature and low density, hence producing little X-ray\nemission. Such hot ejecta, driven by its large buoyancy, can quickly reach a\nsubstantially higher outward velocity than the ambient medium, which is\ndominated by mass loss from evolved stars. The ejecta is gradually and\ndynamically mixed with the medium at large galactic radii. The ejecta is also\nslowly diluted and cooled by {\\sl insitu} mass injection from evolved stars.\nThese processes together naturally result in the observed positive gradient in\nthe average radial iron abundance distribution of the hot gas, even if\nmass-weighted. This trend is in addition to the X-ray measurement bias that\ntends to underestimate the iron abundance for the hot gas with a temperature\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 12:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The photodissociating flux incident on the cloud is\ncomputed from the far-UV luminosity of the OB association and the geometry. We\nhave applied this \"PDR Method\" to a sample of star-forming regions in M33 using\nVLA 21-cm data for the HI and GALEX imagery in the far-UV. It provides an\nestimate of the total volume density of hydrogen (atomic + molecular) in the\ngas clouds surrounding the young star cluster. A logarithmic graph of the\ncluster UV luminosity versus the surrounding gas density is a direct measure of\nthe star formation law. However, this plot is severely affected by\nobservational selection, rendering large areas of the diagram inaccessible to\nthe data. An ordinary least-squares regression fit therefore gives a strongly\nbiased result.

As the parameter values of D - {\\Sigma} and\n{\\Sigma} - D fits are invariant within the estimated uncertainties for\northogonal regressions, slopes of the empirical {\\Sigma} - D relations should\nbe determined by using the orthogonal regression fitting procedure. Thus\nobtained {\\Sigma} - D relations for samples which are not under severe\ninfluence of the selection effects could be used for estimating SNR distances.\nUsing the orthogonal regression fitting procedure {\\Sigma} - D slope {\\beta}\n\\approx 3.9 is obtained for the sample of 31 SNRs in M82. The results of\nimplemented Monte Carlo simulations show that the sensitivity selection effect\ndoes not significantly influence the slope of M82 relation.

The\neffect of the deformation on the conductivity is twofold: The lattice\ndistortion can be represented as pseudovector potential in the Dirac equation\nformalism, whereas the gate causes inhomogeneous density redistribution. We use\nthe elasticity theory to find the profile of the graphene sheet and then\nevaluate the conductivity by means of the transfer matrix approach. We find\nthat the two effects provide functionally different contributions to the\nconductivity. For small deformations and not too high residual stress the\ncorrection due to the charge redistribution dominates and leads to the\nenhancement of the conductivity. For stronger deformations, the effect of the\nlattice distortion becomes more important and eventually leads to the\nsuppression of the conductivity. We consider homogeneous as well as local\ndeformation. We also suggest that the effect of the charge redistribution can\nbe best measured in a setup containing two gates, one fixing the overall charge\ndensity and another one deforming graphene locally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 15:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
