However,\naccording to the Byers-Yang theorem, observables of an electronic system are\ninvariant under an adiabatic insertion of a quantum of singular flux. We\nresolve this seeming paradox by considering a microscopic model of electronic\ninterferometers made from a quantum Hall liquid at filling factor 1/m. An\napproximate ground state of such interferometers is described by a Laughlin\ntype wave function, and low-energy excitations are incompressible deformations\nof this state. We construct a low-energy effective theory by restricting the\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian of electrons to the space of incompressible\ndeformations and show that the theory of the quantum Hall edge so obtained is a\ngeneralization of a chiral conformal field theory. In our theory, a\nquasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of\ntunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined\nby the positions of Ohmic contacts. We describe strong coupling of the edge\nstates to Ohmic contacts and the resulting quasi-particle current through the\ninterferometer with the help of a master equation. We find that the coherent\ncontribution to the average quasi-particle current through Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometers does not vanish after summation over quasi-particle degrees of\nfreedom. However, it acquires oscillations with the electronic period, in\nagreement with the Byers-Yang theorem. Importantly, our theory does not rely on\nany ad-hoc constructions, such as Klein factors, etc. When the magnetic flux\nthrough an FP interferometer is varied with a modulation gate, current\noscillations have the quasi-particle periodicity, thus allowing for\nspectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 16:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 14:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Particularly, radius and effective\ntemperatures computed from models are ~ 5-10% lower and ~ 3-5% higher than\nobserved, respectively. These discrepancies have been attributed to different\nfactors, notably to the high levels of magnetic activity present on these\nstars. In this paper, we test the effect of magnetic activity both on models\nand on the observational analysis of eclipsing binaries using a sample of such\nsystems with accurate fundamental properties. Regarding stellar models, we have\nfound that unrealistically high spot coverages need to be assumed to reproduce\nthe observations. Tests considering metallicity effects and missing opacities\non models indicate that these are not able to explain the radius discrepancies\nobserved. With respect to the observations, we have tested the effect of\nseveral spot distributions on the light curve analysis. Our results show that\nspots cause systematic deviations on the stellar radii derived from light curve\nanalysis when distributed mainly over the stellar poles. Assuming the existence\nof polar spots, overall agreement between models and observations is reached\nwhen ~ 35% spot coverage is considered on stellar models. Such spot coverage\ninduces a systematic deviation in the radius determination from the light curve\nanalysis of ~ 3% and is also compatible with the modulations observed on the\nlight curves of these systems.

This oxygen-rich disc can reflect X-rays emitted by the neutron\nstar giving a characteristic emission spectrum. We have analyzed\nhigh-resolution RGS and broad band EPIC spectra of 4U 0614+091 obtained by the\nXMM-Newton satellite. We detect a broad emission feature at ~0.7 keV in both\ninstruments, which cannot be explained by unusual abundances of oxygen and neon\nin the line of sight, as proposed before in the literature. We interpret this\nfeature as O VIII Lyalpha emission caused by reflection of X-rays off highly\nionized oxygen, in the strong gravitational field close to the neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 20:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The von Neumann entropy is a special case of a more general class of\nentropies called Renyi entropies. Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the\nentanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an\narbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula. We\npoint out, however, that his EREs are incorrect, since his putative saddle\npoints do not in fact solve the Einstein equation. We remedy this situation in\nthe case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two\nintervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we\nreproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a\nphase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation,\nand that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations\nlarger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT\ntechniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions. We also find evidence\nthat large-$N$ symmetric-product theories have the same EREs as holographic\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 02:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 00:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 19:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}

This system is a kinetic model which has a similar Vlasov structure as\nthe classical Vlasov-Poisson system, but is coupled to a potential in $-1/r-\n1/r^2$ (Manev potential) instead of the usual gravitational potential in\n$-1/r$, and in particular the potential field does not satisfy a Poisson\nequation but a fractional-Laplacian equation. We first prove the orbital\nstability of the ground states type solutions which are constructed as\nminimizers of the Hamiltonian, following the classical strategy: compactness of\nthe minimizing sequences and the rigidity of the flow. However, in driving this\nanalysis, there are two mathematical obstacles: the first one is related to the\npossible blow-up of solutions to the VM system, which we overcome by imposing a\nsub-critical condition on the constraints of the variational problem. The\nsecond difficulty (and the most important) is related to the nature of the\nEuler-Lagrange equations (fractional-Laplacian equations) to which classical\nresults for the Poisson equation do not extend.

In the second part of this work, we prove the\nexistence of exact self-similar blow-up solutions to the Vlasov-Manev equation,\nwith initial data arbitrarily close to ground states.

We have\nrevised the treatments of the transition between the rapid infall and cooling\nflow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges and of gaseous and\nstellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central and\nsatellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star\nstripping once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency and\nscaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance of\nlow-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9\nmagnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of Milky Way\nsatellites. This suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solve\nthe \"missing satellite\" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. The\nsame model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as a\nfunction of stellar mass and colour. The fit remains excellent down to ~30kpc\nfor massive galaxies.

Although not permitted under current standards for\ninterconnection of distributed generation, fast-reacting, VAR-capable PV\ninverters may provide the necessary reactive power injection or consumption to\nmaintain voltage regulation under difficult transient conditions. As side\nbenefit, the control of reactive power injection at each PV inverter provides\nan opportunity and a new tool for distribution utilities to optimize the\nperformance of distribution circuits, e.g. by minimizing thermal losses. We\nsuggest a local control scheme that dispatches reactive power from each PV\ninverter based on local instantaneous measurements of the real and reactive\ncomponents of the consumed power and the real power generated by the PVs. Using\none adjustable parameter per circuit, we balance the requirements on power\nquality and desire to minimize thermal losses. Numerical analysis of two\nexemplary systems, with comparable total PV generation albeit a different\nspatial distribution, show how to adjust the optimization parameter depending\non the goal. Overall, this local scheme shows excellent performance; it's\ncapable of guaranteeing acceptable power quality and achieving significant\nsaving in thermal losses in various situations even when the renewable\ngeneration in excess of the circuit own load, i.e. feeding power back to the\nhigher-level system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 15:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}
