Taking advantage on the rotation of the Solar system around the\nGalactic center through the Dark Matter halo, it allows to show a direction\ndependence of WIMP events.

Nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms are often used\nto retrieve similar entries, given a query. While there exist efficient\ntechniques for exact query lookup using hashing, similarity search using exact\nnearest neighbors is known to be a hard problem and in high dimensions, best\nknown solutions offer little improvement over a linear scan. Fast solutions to\nthe approximate NNS problem include Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based\ntechniques, which need storage polynomial in $n$ with exponent greater than\n$1$, and query time sublinear, but still polynomial in $n$, where $n$ is the\nsize of the database. In this work we present a new technique of solving the\napproximate NNS problem in Euclidean space using a Ternary Content Addressable\nMemory (TCAM), which needs near linear space and has O(1) query time. In fact,\nthis method also works around the best known lower bounds in the cell probe\nmodel for the query time using a data structure near linear in the size of the\ndata base. TCAMs are high performance associative memories widely used in\nnetworking applications such as access control lists. A TCAM can query for a\nbit vector within a database of ternary vectors, where every bit position\nrepresents $0$, $1$ or $*$. The $*$ is a wild card representing either a $0$ or\na $1$. We leverage TCAMs to design a variant of LSH, called Ternary Locality\nSensitive Hashing (TLSH) wherein we hash database entries represented by\nvectors in the Euclidean space into $\\{0,1,*\\}$. By using the added\nfunctionality of a TLSH scheme with respect to the $*$ character, we solve an\ninstance of the approximate nearest neighbor problem with 1 TCAM access and\nstorage nearly linear in the size of the database. We believe that this work\ncan open new avenues in very high speed data mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 16:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-18"}

Previous attempts to\nmeasure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 to\nnearly 1. Rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify through\nmodeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the density\nand distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate of\nionizing photons production. We find that the escape fraction depends\nsensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of the\nclumped and interclump medium. One must therefore be cautious when dealing with\nan inhomogeneous medium. Fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escape\nfraction than more numerous low-density clumps. When more ionizing photons are\nproduced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily from\nthe gas layers. Large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused by\ndifferences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observed\ndifferences in fesc among galaxies. Values of fesc must also be consistent with\nthe reionization history. High-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize the\nuniverse, because fesc > 1 would be required. Small galaxies are needed to\nachieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 16:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 09:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

A related distance measures\nthe amount of nonreversibility of a computation. Using the physical theory of\nreversible computation, we give an appropriate (universal, anti-symmetric, and\ntransitive) measure of the thermodynamic work required to transform one object\nin another object by the most efficient process.

Recently\nthere has been strong experimental evidence showing that C4 symmetry breaking\noccurs on formation of the pseudogap. This form of symmetry breaking was\npredicted by the Fluctuating Bond Model (FBM), an empirical model based on a\nstrong, local coupling of electrons to the square of the planar oxygen vibrator\namplitudes. In this paper we approach the FBM theory from a new direction,\nstarting from {\\it ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations\ndemonstrate a doping-dependent instability of the in-plane oxygens towards\ndisplacement off the Cu-O-Cu bond axis. From these results and perturbation\ntheory we derive an improved and quantitative form of the Fluctuating Bond\nModel. A mean field solution of the FBM leads to C4 symmetry breaking in the\noxygen vibrational amplitudes, and to a d-type pseudogap in the electronic\nspectrum, the features linked by recent experimental data. The phase diagram of\nthe pseudogap derived from mean field theory, its doping- and\ntemperature-dependences, including the phase boundary T$^*$, agree well with\nexperimental data. We extend the theory to include the long range Coulomb\ninteraction on the same basis as the FBM interaction. When the long-range\nCoulomb interaction is included in the FBM, a CDW instability in the charge\nchannel is predicted which explains the nanoscale, rather than spatially\nuniform, behavior of the C4 symmetry-breaking. Taking the CDW into account,\nwith the theoretical k-dependence of the pseudogap, enables the Fermi Surface\narc phenomenon to be understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 18:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-18"}

Red AGN hosts are typically slightly bluer than\nred-sequence control galaxies, which suggests that their stellar populations\nare slightly younger. We compare these colour data to current models of AGN\nformation. The unexpected trend of less X-ray obscuration in blue-cloud\ngalaxies and more in red-sequence galaxies is problematic for all AGN feedback\nmodels, in which gas and dust is thought to be removed as star formation shuts\ndown.

The data were obtained with the HAO/NSO Advanced Stokes Polarimeter,\nabout a near disc center sunspot region, NOAA AR 9661. We compare the\ncharacteristics of Stokes profiles in terms of Doppler shifts and asymmetries\namong the three spectral lines, which helps us to better understand the\nchromospheric lines and the magnetic and flow fields in different magnetic\nregions. The main results are: (1) For penumbral area observed by the\nphotospheric FeI lines, Doppler velocities derived from Stokes I (Vi) are very\nclose to those derived from linear polarization profiles (Vlp) but\nsignificantly different from those derived from Stokes V profiles (Vzc), which\nprovides direct and strong evidence that the penumbral Evershed flows are\nmagnetized and mainly carried by the horizontal magnetic component. (2) The\nrudimentary inverse Evershed effect observed by the MgI b2 line provides a\nqualitative evidence on its formation height that is around or just above the\ntemperature minimum region. (3) Vzc and Vlp in penumbrae and Vzc in pores\ngenerally approach their Vi observed by the chromospheric MgI line, which is\nnot the case for the photospheric FeI lines. (4) Outer penumbrae and pores show\nsimilar behavior of the Stokes V asymmetries that tend to change from positive\nvalues in the photosphere (FeI lines) to negative values in the low\nchromosphere (MgI line). (5) The Stokes V profiles in plage regions are highly\nasymmetric in the photosphere and more symmetric in the low chromosphere.

When the coupling $K$ is larger\nthan a threshold $K_E$, there is a macroscopic cluster of\nfrequency-synchronized oscillators. We explain why the macroscopic cluster\ndisappears at $K_E$. We view the system in terms of vortices, since cluster\nboundaries are delineated by the motion of these topological defects. In the\nentrained phase ($K>K_E$), vortices move in fixed paths around clusters, while\nin the unentrained phase ($K<K_E$), vortices sometimes wander off. These\ndeviant vortices are responsible for the disappearance of the macroscopic\ncluster. The regularity of vortex motion is determined by whether clusters\nbehave as single effective oscillators. The unentrained phase is also\ncharacterized by time-dependent cluster structure and the presence of chaos.\nThus, the entrainment transition is actually an order-chaos transition. We\npresent an analytical argument for the scaling $K_E\\sim K_L$ for small\nlattices, where $K_L$ is the threshold for phase-locking.

Such a critical\nbehavior, resulting from the combined effect of stochastic processes in the PD\ngame and the heterogeneous structure of complex networks, illustrates the\ndiversity of social relationships and the self-organization of cooperator\ncommunities in real-world systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 04:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The latter, in turn, is\nsupposed to be induced by the whole aggregate of dissipation processes taking\nplace at the air-sea interface.

The\nmonitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds,\nif for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite\nword v, such that uv becomes a \"finite witness\" wrt. L; that is, for any\ninfinite word w, we have that uvw \\in L, or for any infinite word w, we have\nthat uvw \\not\\in L.

But an exact categorisation of monitorable languages has, so far,\nbeen missing. Motivated by the use of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in many\napproaches to runtime verification, this paper first determines the complexity\nof the monitorability problem when L is given by an LTL formula.

In the case of the Ising-like Heisenberg\nHamiltonian spinons can be interpreted as domain walls (DWs) separating\ndegenerate ground states. In dimension $d>1$, the issue of spinons as\nelementary excitations is still unsettled. In this paper, we study two\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ AFM ladder models in which the individual chains are\ndescribed by the Ising-like Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The rung exchange\ninteractions are assumed to be pure Ising-type in one case and Ising-like\nHeisenberg in the other. Using the low-energy effective Hamiltonian approach in\na perturbative formulation, we show that the spinons are coupled in bound\npairs.

The appropriate dynamic\nstructure factor is calculated and the associated lineshape is found to be\nalmost symmetric in contrast to the 1d case.

These theories can be\nformulated as integrable deformations of gauged WZW models. In this work we\nconsider the class of symmetric spaces CP^{n+1} and solve the corresponding\ngeneralized sine-Gordon theories at the quantum level by finding the exact\nspectrum of topological solitons, or kinks, and their S-matrix. The latter\ninvolves a trignometric solution of the Yang-Baxer equation which exhibits a\nquantum group symmetry with a tower of states that is bounded, unlike for\nmagnons, as a result of the quantum group deformation parameter q being a root\nof unity. We test the S-matrix by taking the semi-classical limit and comparing\nwith the time delays for the scattering of classical solitons. We argue that\nthe internal CP^{n-1} moduli space of collective coordinates of the solitons in\nthe classical theory can be interpreted as a q-deformed fuzzy space in the\nquantum theory.

At low temperatures, $\\tau_{\\text{hetero}}(\\tau_\\alpha)$ is\nconsiderably larger than $\\tau_{\\alpha}$, while\n$\\tau_{\\text{hetero}}(\\tau_{\\text{ngp}})$ remains comparable to\n$\\tau_{\\alpha}$. Thus, the lifetime of the heterogeneous dynamics depends\nstrongly on the time interval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 14:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 09:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 09:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-25"}

The first one is the polaronic localisation at the unit cell scale\non residual impurities in ferroelectric networks. The second one is the\ncollective localisation of free charge at macroscopic interfaces like surfaces,\nelectrodes and grain boundaries in ceramics. Polarons have been observed in\nmany oxide perovskites mostly when cations having several stable electronic\nconfigurations are present. In manganites, the density of such polarons is so\nhigh as to drive a net lattice of interacting polarons. On the other hand, in\nferroelectric materials like BaTiO3 and LiNbO3, the density of polarons is\nusually very small but they can influence strongly the macroscopic\nconductivity. The contribution of such polarons to the dielectric spectra of\nferroelectric materials is described. Even residual impurities as for example\nIron can induce well defined anomalies at very low temperatures. This is mostly\nresulting from the interaction between localised polarons and the highly\npolarisable ferroelectric network in which they are embedded. The case of such\nresidual polarons in SrTiO3 will be described in more details, emphasizing the\nquantum polaron state at liquid helium temperatures. Recently, several\nnon-ferroelectric oxides have been shown to display giant effective dielectric\npermittivity. It is first shown that the frequency/temperature behaviour of\nsuch parameters is very similar in very different compounds (donor doped\nBaTiO3, CaCu3Ti4O12, LuFe2O4,Li doped NiO,...). This similarity calls for a\ncommon origin of the giant dielectric permittivity in these compounds. A space\ncharge localisation at macroscopic interfaces can be the key for such extremely\nhigh dielectric permittivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 15:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-21"}

By combining theoretical and numerical methods, we\nestablish a clearer understanding of the non-equilibrium phase transition known\nto occur in such systems. The transition is between a growing phase in which\nthe total mass increases for all time and a non-growing phase in which the\ntotal mass is bounded. In addition to deriving rigorous bounds on the position\nof the transition point, we show that the growing phase is in the same\nuniversality class as diffusion-aggregation models with deposition but no\nevaporation. In this regime, the flux of mass in mass space becomes\nasymptotically constant (as a function of mass) at large times. The magnitude\nof this flux depends on the evaporation rate but the fact that it is\nasymptotically constant does not. The associated constant flux relation exactly\ndetermines the scaling of the two-point mass correlation function with mass in\nall dimensions while higher-order mass correlation functions exhibit nonlinear\nmulti-scaling in dimension less than 2. If the deposition rate is below some\ncritical value, a different stationary state is reached at large times\ncharacterised by a global balance between evaporation and deposition with a\nscale-by-scale balance between the mass fluxes due to aggregation and\nevaporation. Both the mass distribution and the flux decay exponentially in\nthis regime. Finally, we develop a scaling theory of the model near the\ncritical point, which yields non-trivial scaling laws for the critical\ntwo-point mass correlation function with mass.

In these systems, reliable\napplications could be engineered without requiring the programmer to write\ntranslation code to manage the transfer of data to and from non-volatile\nstorage. More importantly, it simplified the programmer's conceptual model of\nan application, and avoided the many coherency problems that result from\nmultiple cached copies of the same information. Although technically\ninnovative, persistent languages were not widely adopted, perhaps due in part\nto their closed-world model. Each persistent store was located on a single\nhost, and there were no flexible mechanisms for communication or transfer of\ndata between separate stores. Here we re-open the work on persistence and\ncombine it with modern peer-to-peer techniques in order to provide support for\northogonal persistence in resilient and potentially long-running distributed\napplications. Our vision is of an infrastructure within which an application\ncan be developed and distributed with minimal modification, whereupon the\napplication becomes resilient to certain failure modes. If a node, or the\nconnection to it, fails during execution of the application, the objects are\nre-instantiated from distributed replicas, without their reference holders\nbeing aware of the failure. Furthermore, we believe that this can be achieved\nwithin a spectrum of application programmer intervention, ranging from minimal\nto totally prescriptive, as desired. The same mechanisms encompass an\northogonally persistent programming model. We outline our approach to\nimplementing this vision, and describe current progress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 15:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-21"}

Thus far, the study of\ntransiting exoplanets has focused almost exclusively on systems with only one\nplanet, except for considering the influence of additional planets on the\ntransit light curve, mostly through transit timing variations (TTVs). This work\nconsiders systems where multiple planets are seen to transit the same star and\nconcludes that such \"multi-transiting\" systems will be the most\ninformation-rich planetary systems besides our own solar system. Five new\ncandidate multi-transiting systems from \\emph{Kepler} have been announced in\nSteffen et al. 2010, though these candidates have not yet been fully confirmed\nas planets. In anticipation of the likely confirmation of multi-transiting\nsystems, we discuss the value of these systems in detail. For example, proper\ninterpretation of transit timing variations is significantly improved in\nmulti-transiting systems. The true mutual inclination, a valuable probe of\nplanetary formation, can also be well determined in certain systems, especially\nthrough Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of each planet. In addition, such\nsystems may undergo predictable and observable mutual events, where one planet\ncrosses over the other, which allow for unique constraints on various physical\nand orbital parameters, particularly the mutual inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 15:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-21"}

These policies permeate applications developed using existing\nmiddleware systems and force an unnatural encoding of application level\nsemantics. For example, the application programmer has no direct control over\ninter-address-space parameter passing semantics. Semantics are fixed by the\ndistribution topology of the application, which is dictated early in the design\ncycle. This creates applications that are brittle with respect to changes in\ndistribution. This paper explores technology that provides control over the\nextent to which inter-address-space communication is exposed to programmers, in\norder to aid the creation, maintenance and evolution of distributed\napplications. The described system permits arbitrary objects in an application\nto be dynamically exposed for remote access, allowing applications to be\nwritten without concern for distribution. Programmers can conceal or expose the\ndistributed nature of applications as required, permitting object placement and\ndistribution boundaries to be decided late in the design cycle and even\ndynamically. Inter-address-space parameter passing semantics may also be\ndecided independently of object implementation and at varying times in the\ndesign cycle, again possibly as late as run-time. Furthermore, transmission\npolicy may be defined on a per-class, per-method or per-parameter basis,\nmaximizing plasticity. This flexibility is of utility in the development of new\ndistributed applications, and the creation of management and monitoring\ninfrastructures for existing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 15:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-21"}

We conclude that the\nconstant scalar curvature term f(R_0) acts as a source of repulsive force and\nthus slows down the collapse of matter. The comparison with the corresponding\nresults available in general relativity indicates that f(R_0) plays the role of\nthe cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 02:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

It is concluded that some\nwaves move away from the event horizon in this unusual medium.
