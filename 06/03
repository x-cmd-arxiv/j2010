In\nthe general singlet extension of the MSSM, both the PAMELA result and the relic\ndensity can be explained by the singlino-like neutralino. Such singlino-like\nneutralinos annihilate into the singlet-like Higgs bosons, which are light\nenough to decay dominantly to muons or electrons, and the annihilation cross\nsection can be greatly enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect via exchanging a light\nCP-even singlet-like Higgs boson. In this scenario, in order to meet the\nstringent LEP constraints, the SM-like Higgs boson tends to decay into the\nsinglet Higgs pairs instead of $b\\bar b$ and consequently it will give a\nmulti-muon signal $h_SM->aa->\\mu$ or $h_{SM}->hh->4 a ->8 \\mu$ at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 16:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-03"}

We consider two\nmodels for the growth of spherical ionized bubbles to study the apparent shapes\nof the bubbles in redshifted 21-cm maps, taking into account the finite light\ntravel time (FLTT) across the bubble. We find that the FLTT, whose effect is\nparticularly pronounced for large bubbles, causes the bubble's image to\ncontinue to grow well after it's actual growth is over. There are two distinct\nFLTT distortions in the bubble's image: (i) its apparent center is shifted\nalong the line of sight (LOS) towards the observer from the quasar; (ii) it's\nshape is anisotropic along the LOS. The bubble initially appears elongated\nalong the LOS. This is reversed in the later stages of growth where the bubble\nappears compressed. The FLTT distortions are expected to have an impact on\nmatched filter bubble detection where it is most convenient to use a spherical\ntemplate for the filter. We find that the best matched spherical filter gives a\nreasonably good estimate of the size and the shift in the center of the\nanisotropic image. The mismatch between the spherical filter and the\nanisotropic image causes a 10 - 20% degradation in the SNR relative to that of\na spherical bubble. We conclude that a spherical filter is adequate for bubble\ndetection. The FLTT distortions do not effect the lower limits for bubble\ndetection with 1000 hr of GMRT observations. The smallest spherical filter for\nwhich a detection is possible has comoving radii 24 Mpc and 33 Mpc for a\n3-sigma and 5-sigma detection respectively, assuming a neutral fraction 0.6 at\nz \\sim 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 16:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 06:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

When the initial current sheet separates magnetic fields which are\nnot perfectly anti-parallel, i.e. they are skewed, magnetic energy is first\nconverted to bulk kinetic energy and then thermalized in slow magnetosonic\nshocks. We show that the latter resemble parallel shocks or hydrodynamic shocks\nfor all skew angles except those very near the anti-parallel limit. As for\nparallel shocks, the structures of reconnection-driven slow shocks are best\nstudied using two-fluid equations in which ions and electrons have independent\ntemperature. Time-dependent solutions of these equations can be used to predict\nand understand the shocks from reconnection of skewed magnetic fields. The\nresults differ from those found using a single-fluid model such as\nmagnetohydrodynamics. In the two-fluid model electrons are heated indirectly\nand thus carry a heat flux always well below the free-streaming limit. The\nviscous stress of the ions is, however, typically near the fluid-treatable\nlimit. We find that for a wide range of skew angles and small plasma beta an\nelectron conduction front extends ahead of the slow shock but remains within\nthe outflow jet. In such cases conduction will play a more limited role in\ndriving chromospheric evaporation than has been predicted based on\nsingle-fluid, anti-parallel models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 16:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The system\nuses two groups of complex cells whose outputs are combined multiplicatively:\none that represents the content of the image, constrained to be constant over\nseveral consecutive frames, and one that represents the precise location of\nfeatures, which is allowed to vary over time but constrained to be sparse. The\narchitecture uses an encoder to extract features, and a decoder to reconstruct\nthe input from the features. The method was applied to patches extracted from\nconsecutive movie frames and produces orientation and frequency selective units\nanalogous to the complex cells in V1. An extension of the method is proposed to\ntrain a network composed of units with local receptive field spread over a\nlarge image of arbitrary size. A layer of complex cells, subject to sparsity\nconstraints, pool feature units over overlapping local neighborhoods, which\ncauses the feature units to organize themselves into pinwheel patterns of\norientation-selective receptive fields, similar to those observed in the\nmammalian visual cortex. A feed-forward encoder efficiently computes the\nfeature representation of full images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 17:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-03"}

In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key\ncan be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum\nparticles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used\nby Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum\nmechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum\ncryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very\neavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both\npractical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on\noperational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -\nthat information gain about one observable must cause disturbance to another,\nincompatible one?\n  Here we resolve this problem by using another striking feature of quantum\nworld - contextuality. It is a strong version of incompatibility manifested in\nthe famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial concept is the use of a new\nclass of families of bipartite probability distributions . We show that if two\npersons share systems which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox and, in\naddition, exhibit perfect correlations, then they can extract secure key, even\nif they do not trust the quantum devices. This is the first operational\nprotocol that directly implements the fundamental feature of Nature: the\ninformation gain vs. disturbance trade-off.\n  For sake of proof we exhibit a new Bell's inequality which is interesting in\nitself. The security is proved not by exploiting strong violation of the\ninequality by quantum mechanics (as one usually proceeds), but rather by\narguing, that quantum mechanics cannot violate it too much.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 19:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-03"}

We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)).

The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc. At larger radii there is no statistically significant\nseparation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured mass\nat ~kpc is ~2-4 M_BH.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

Previously, this star experienced\nan outburst also in 2000 (known as SN 2000ch). During outbursts the star\nreached an absolute magnitude between -12.1 and -12.8. Its spectrum showed H,\nHe I and Fe II lines with P-Cygni profiles during and soon after the eruptive\nphases, while only intermediate-width lines in pure emission (including He II\n4686A were visible during quiescence. The fast-evolving light curve soon after\nthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and the\noverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes of\nvariability of an extremely active LBV. However, the widths of the spectral\nlines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar to\nthose observed in Wolf-Rayet stars. Although modulated light curves are typical\nof LBVs during the S-Dor variability phase, the luminous maxima and the high\nfrequency of outbursts are unexpected in S-Dor variables. Such extreme\nvariability may be associated with repeated ejection episodes during a giant\neruption of an LBV. Alternatively, it may be indicative of a high level of\ninstability shortly preceding the core-collapse or due to interaction with a\nmassive, binary companion. In this context, the variable in NGC 3432 shares\nsome similarities with the famous stellar system HD 5980 in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud, which includes an erupting LBV and an early Wolf-Rayet star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 21:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Can dark energy have strong dynamical effects on small cosmic scales as\nwell as globally? Continuing our efforts to clarify this question, we focus now\non the Virgo Cluster and the flow of expansion around it. We interpret the\nHubble diagram, from a new database of velocities and distances of galaxies in\nthe cluster and its environment, using a nonlinear analytical model which\nincorporates the antigravity force in terms of Newtonian mechanics. The key\nparameter is the zero-gravity radius, the distance at which gravity and\nantigravity are in balance. Our conclusions are: 1. The interplay between the\ngravity of the cluster and the antigravity of the dark energy background\ndetermines the kinematical structure of the system and controls its evolution.\n2. The gravity dominates the quasi-stationary bound cluster, while the\nantigravity controls the Virgocentric flow, bringing order and regularity to\nthe flow, which reaches linearity and the global Hubble rate at distances \\ga\n15 Mpc. 3. The cluster and the flow form a system similar to the Local Group\nand its outflow. In the velocity-distance diagram, the cluster-flow structure\nreproduces the group-flow structure with a scaling factor of about 10; the\nzero-gravity radius for the cluster system is also 10 times larger. The phase\nand dynamical similarity of the systems on the scales of 1-30 Mpc suggests that\na two-component pattern may be universal for groups and clusters: a\nquasi-stationary bound central component and an expanding outflow around it,\ndue to the nonlinear gravity-antigravity interplay with the dark energy\ndominating in the flow component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 05:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The change of screening\nprocesses does not alter this tendency, and thus, the screened on-site\ncomponent of the interaction - the Hubbard U of the effective low-energy system\n- increases with pressure as well. The orbital anisotropy of the effects\noriginates from the orientation of the orbitals vis-a-vis the deformation of\nthe unit-cell.

The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the\ngas phase chemistry in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is a key input in\nunraveling the coupled chemical and dynamical evolution of the ISM. Methods.\nThe lowest rotational lines of HCO+, HCN, HNC, and CN were observed at the\nIRAM-30m telescope in absorption against the \\lambda 3 mm and \\lambda 1.3 mm\ncontinuum emission of massive star-forming regions in the Galactic plane. The\nabsorption lines probe the gas over kiloparsecs along these lines of sight. The\nexcitation temperatures of HCO+ are inferred from the comparison of the\nabsorptions in the two lowest transitions. The spectra of all molecular species\non the same line of sight are decomposed into Gaussian velocity components.\nMost appear in all the spectra of a given line of sight. For each component, we\nderived the central opacity, the velocity dispersion, and computed the\nmolecular column density. We compared our results to the predictions of\nUV-dominated chemical models of photodissociation regions (PDR models) and to\nthose of non-equilibrium models in which the chemistry is driven by the\ndissipation of turbulent energy (TDR models). Results. The molecular column\ndensities of all the velocity components span up to two orders of magnitude.\nThose of CN, HCN, and HNC are linearly correlated with each other with mean\nratios N(HCN)/N(HNC) = 4.8 $\\pm$ 1.3 and N(CN)/N(HNC) = 34 $\\pm$ 12, and more\nloosely correlated with those of HCO+, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 0.5 $\\pm$ 0.3,\nN(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.9 $\\pm$ 0.9, and N(CN)/N(HCO+) = 18 $\\pm$ 9. These ratios\nare similar to those inferred from observations of high Galactic latitude lines\nof sight, suggesting that the gas sampled by absorption lines in the Galactic\nplane has the same chemical properties as that in the Solar neighbourhood. The\nFWHM of the Gaussian velocity components span the range 0.3 to 3 km s-1 and\nthose of the HCO+ lines are found to be 30% broader than those of CN-bearing\nmolecules. The PDR models fail to reproduce simultaneously the observed\nabundances of the CN-bearing species and HCO+, even for high-density material\n(100 cm-3 < nH < 104 cm-3). The TDR models, in turn, are able to reproduce the\nobserved abundances and abundance ratios of all the analysed molecules for the\nmoderate gas densities (30 cm-3 < nH < 200 cm-3) and the turbulent energy\nobserved in the diffuse interstellar medium.

The details\nof the dissipation mechanisms still need to be investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 08:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The solution of the\nproblem is obtained by calculating the Green's function which links the\npressure distribution to the normal displacements at the interface. The problem\nis then formulated in the form of a Fredholm integral equation of the first\nkind with a logarithmic kernel, and the boundaries of the contact area are\ncalculated by requiring that the energy of the system is stationary. The\nmethodology has been employed to study the adhesive contact between an elastic\nsemi-infinite solid and a randomly rough rigid profile with a self-affine\nfractal geometry. We show that, even in presence of adhesion, the true contact\narea still linearly depends on the applied load. The numerical results are then\ncritically compared with the prediction of an extended version of the Persson's\ncontact mechanics theory, able to handle anisotropic surfaces, as 1D\ninterfaces. It is shown that, for any given load, Persson's theory\nunderestimates the contact area of about 50% in comparison with our numerical\ncalculations. We find that this discrepancy is larger than what is found for 2D\nrough surfaces in case of adhesionless contact. We argue that this increased\ndifference might be explained, at least partially, by considering that\nPersson's theory is a mean field theory in spirit, so it should work better for\n2D rough surfaces rather than for 1D rough surfaces. We also observe, that the\npredicted value of separation is in very good agreement with our numerical\nresults as well as the exponent of the power spectral density of the contact\npressure distribution and of the elastic displacement of the solid. Therefore,\nwe conclude that Persson's theory captures almost exactly the main qualitative\nbehavior of the rough contact phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 09:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-04"}

For each detection, the filter provides its\nsignificance, an estimate for the richness and for the redshift even if photo-z\nare not given. The provided analytical error estimate is tested against\nnumerical simulations. We finally apply our method to the COSMOS field and\ncompare the results with previous cluster detections obtained with different\nmethods. Our catalogue contains 27 galaxy clusters with minimal threshold at\n3-sigma level including both optical and weak-lensing information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 10:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 14:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The major contribution of our\nwork lies in considering quantized channel state information (CSI)(for the\nvector channel space consisting of all secondary-to-secondary and\nsecondary-to-primary channels) at the secondary transmitter. It is assumed that\na band manager or a cognitive radio service provider has access to the full CSI\ninformation from the secondary and primary receivers and designs (offline) an\noptimal power codebook based on the statistical information (channel\ndistributions) of the channels and feeds back the index of the codebook to the\nsecondary transmitter for every channel realization in real-time, via a\ndelay-free noiseless limited feedback channel.

Starting from a\ngeneral, unspecified model and making use of standard multiple scales analysis,\nI show that the close-to-threshold dynamics of such systems is universally\ngoverned by a generalized, complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation. The nature\nof the generalization depends on the strength and of other features of forcing:\n(i) For generic, sufficiently weak forcings the CGL equation contains an extra,\ninhomogeneous term proportional to the complex amplitude of forcing, as in the\nusual 1:1 resonance with spatially uniform forcing; (ii) For stronger\nperturbations, whose amplitude sign alternates across the system, the CGL\nequation contains a term proportional to the complex conjugate of the\noscillations envelope, like in the classical 2:1 resonance, responsible for the\nemergence of phase bistability and of phase bistable patterns in the system.\nFinally I show that case (ii) is retrieved from case (i) in the appropriate\nlimit so that the latter can be regarded as the generic model for the\nclose-to-threshold dynamics of the type of systems considered here. The kind of\nforcing studied in this work thus represents an alternative to the classical\nparametric forcing at twice the natural frequency of oscillations and opens the\nway to new forms of pattern formation control in self-oscillatory systems, what\nis especially relevant in the case of systems that are quite insensitive to\nparametric forcing, such as lasers and other nonlinear optical cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 12:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-04"}

We use a physically realistic\nviscosity model derived from N-body simulations (Daisaka et al., 2001), and\ndependent on the disk's local properties (surface mass density, particle size,\ndistance to the planet). Particularly, we include the effects of gravitational\ninstabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk's viscosity. We show\nthat common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant\nviscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel. We find however that the present shape of Saturn's rings looks like a\n100 million-years old disk in our simulations.

Allowed configurations of these rotations are described by\nclassical discrete integrable equations, closely related to the famous\n$Q_4$-equations by Adler Bobenko and Suris. Fluctuations between degenerate\nground states in the vicinity of zero temperature are described by a rather\ngeneral integrable lattice model with discrete spin variables. In some simple\nspecial cases the latter reduces to the Kashiwara-Miwa and chiral Potts models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 13:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 08:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-25"}

In this paper we advertize two\nimproved variants of the \\sqrt{s}_{min} variable, which overcome this problem.\nFirst we show that by evaluating the \\sqrt{s}_{min} variable at the RECO level,\nin terms of the reconstructed objects in the event, the effects from the\nunderlying event are significantly diminished and the nice correlation between\nthe peak in the \\sqrt{s}_{min}^{(reco)} distribution and the new physics mass\nscale is restored. Secondly, the underlying event problem can be avoided\naltogether when the \\sqrt{s}_{min} concept is applied to a subsystem of the\nevent which does not involve any QCD jets. We supply an analytic formula for\nthe resulting subsystem \\sqrt{s}_{min}^{(sub)} variable and show that its peak\nexhibits the usual correlation with the mass scale of the particles produced in\nthe subsystem. Finally, we contrast \\sqrt{s}_{min} to other popular inclusive\nvariables such as H_T, M_{Tgen} and M_{TTgen}.

To establish habitability we use the estimated distances\nfrom the giant planet(s) within which an Earth-like planet would be inside the\ngravitational reach of the giant. Of the 79 transiting systems known in April\n2010, only 2 do not offer safe havens to Earth-like planets in the HZ, and thus\ncould not support life today. We have also estimated whether habitability is\npossible for 1.7 Gyr into the past i.e. 0.7 Gyr for a heavy bombardment, plus\n1.0 Gyr for life to emerge and thus be present today. We find that, for the\nbest estimate of each stellar age, an additional 28 systems do not offer such\nsustained habitability. If we reduce 1.7 Gyr to 1.0 Gyr this number falls to\n22.

One\nfinding is that, if the normal operational mode of the grid is sufficiently\nhealthy, the failure modes, also called instantons, are sufficiently sparse,\ni.e. the failures are caused by load fluctuations at only a few buses. The\ntechnique is useful for discovering weak links which are saturated at the\ninstantons. It can also identify generators working at the capacity and\ngenerators under capacity, thus providing predictive capability for improving\nthe reliability of any power network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 15:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2010 17:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-16"}
