Since the parent\ncompounds of the iron pnictides contain an even number of 3d-electrons per Fe,\nit is important to determine whether a Mott transition robustly exists and the\nnature of the possible Mott insulating phases. We address these issues in a\nminimal two-orbital model and a more realistic four-orbital model for the\nparent iron pnictides using a slave-spin approach. In the two-orbital model\nwith two electrons per Fe, we identify a transition from metal to Mott\ninsulator. The critical coupling, $U_c$, is greatly reduced by the Hund's\ncoupling. Depending on the ratio between the inter- and intra-orbital Coulomb\nrepulsions, the insulating state can be either a spin-Mott insulator or an\norbital-Mott insulator. In the four-orbital model with four electrons per Fe,\nwe find an orbitally selective metal-to-insulator transition in the case of\nzero Hund's coupling; the transition to a Mott insulator in the $xz$ and $yz$\norbitals takes place at the same critical coupling as the transition to a band\ninsulator in the $xy$ and $x^2-y^2$ orbitals. In the presence of a finite\nHund's coupling, however, the localization transition is into a spin-Mott\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 16:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 15:57:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2011 16:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-06"}

The\naim is to collect about 100 signal events in two years of data taking with a\nbackground to signal ratio smaller than 10%. The principle of the experimental\nmeasurement and the layout of the detector are presented. During 2007/2008 a\ndedicated run devoted to NA62 prototype tests and study of K_e2 decays was\ntaken. The first phase of the NA62 experiment is aiming at a high precision\ntest of the lepton universality by measuring the helicity suppressed ratio R_K.\nThe preliminary result based on 40% of the 2007 NA62 data sample, R_K =\nK_e2/K_mu2 = (2.500 +/- 0.016) x 10^-5, which is the first result with a\nprecision better than 1%, is consistent with the Standard Model.\n  Aiming at charge asymmetry measurements, the NA48/2 experiment collected an\nunprecedented amount of charged K_(3 pi) events.

Particular field configurations supported by different astrophysical\nobjects may be observable in cosmic ray maps. We consider a simple\nconfiguration, a constant azimuthal field in a disk-like object, that we\nidentify as a cosmic magnetic lens. Such configuration is typical in most\nspiral galaxies, and we assume that it can also appear at smaller or larger\nscales. We show that the magnetic lens deflects cosmic rays in a regular\ngeometrical pattern, very much like a gravitational lens deflects light but\nwith some interesting differences. In particular, the lens acts effectively\nonly in a definite region of the cosmic-ray spectrum, and it can be convergent\nor divergent depending on the (clockwise or counterclockwise) direction of the\nmagnetic field and the (positive or negative) electric charge of the cosmic\nray. We find that the image of a point-like monochromatic source may be one,\ntwo or four points depending on the relative position of source, observer and\ncenter of the lens. For a perfect alignment and a lens in the orthogonal plane\nthe image becomes a ring. We also show that the presence of a lens could\nintroduce low-scale fluctuations and matter-antimatter asymmetries in the\nfluxes from distant sources. The concept of cosmic magnetic lens that we\nintroduce here may be useful in the interpretation of possible patterns\nobserved in the cosmic ray flux at different energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 16:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 11:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This property is basically the combination of conformal\ninvariance and the locality of the interaction in the model. Unlike the Markov\nproperty that Schramm used to characterize SLE curves (which involves\nconditioning on partially generated interfaces up to arbitrary stopping times),\nthis property only involves conditioning on entire loops and thus appears at\nfirst glance to be weaker.\n  Our first main result is that there exists exactly a one-dimensional family\nof random loop collections with this property---one for each k in (8/3,4]---and\nthat the loops are forms of SLE(k). The proof proceeds in two steps. First,\nuniqueness is established by showing that every such loop ensemble can be\ngenerated by an \"exploration\" process based on SLE.\n  Second, existence is obtained using the two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup,\nwhich is a Poissonian random collection of loops in a planar domain.

We use rest-frame ultraviolet\nspectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to construct three composite spectra\nsorted by L_FIR, corresponding to average SFRs of 4980, 2130 and 340 M_\\odot\nyr^-1 after correcting for a nominal quasar FIR contribution.

The formal derived metallicities, Z ~ 5-9 Z_\\odot , are\nsimilar to those derived for the BLRs of other quasars at similar redshifts and\nluminosities. These results suggest that the ongoing star formation in the host\nis not responsible for the metal enrichment of the BLR gas. Instead, the BLR\ngas must have been enriched before the visible quasar phase. These results for\nhigh quasar metallicities, regardless of L_FIR, are consistent with evolution\nscenarios wherein visibly bright quasars appear after the main episode(s) of\nstar formation and metal enrichment in the host galaxies. Finally, young\nquasars, those more closely associated with a recent merger or a blowout of gas\nand dust, may exhibit tracers of these events, such as redder continuum slopes\nand higher incidence of narrow absorption lines. With the caveat of small\nsample sizes, we find no relation between L_FIR and the reddening or the\nincidence of absorption lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 21:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Both kinds of\ndielectric functions depend strongly on q, in contrast with the Dirac model.\nThe QSGW approximation is shown to describe QP levels very well, with small\nsystematic errors analogous to bulk sp semiconductors. Local-field effects are\nrather more important in graphene than in bulk semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2010 02:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The magnetic configuration consists of an inhomogeneous\nmagnetic slab sandwiched between two regions of semi-infinite homogeneous\nmagnetic plasmas. Laterally driven FMA waves penetrate the inhomogeneous slab\ninteracting with the localised slow or Alfven waves present in the\ninhomogeneous layer and are partly reflected, dissipated and transmitted by\nthis region. The presented research aims to find the coefficient of wave energy\nabsorption under solar chromospheric and coronal conditions. Numerical results\nare analyzed to find the coefficient of wave energy absorption at both the slow\nand Alfven resonance positions. The mathematical derivations are based on the\ntwo simplifying assumptions that (i) nonlinearity is weak, and (ii) the\nthickness of the inhomogeneous layer is small in comparison to the wavelength\nof the wave, i.e. we employ the so-called long wavelength approximation. Slow\nresonance is found to be described by the nonlinear theory, while the dynamics\nat the Alfven resonance can be described within the linear framework. We\nintroduce a new concept of coupled resonances, which occurs when two different\nresonances are in close proximity to each other, causing the incoming wave to\nact as though it has been influenced by the two resonances simultaneously. Our\nresults show that the wave energy absorption is heavily dependent on the angle\nof the incident wave in combination with the inclination angle of the\nequilibrium magnetic field. In addition, it is found that FMA waves are very\nefficiently absorbed at the Alfven resonance under coronal conditions. Under\nchromospheric conditions the FMA waves are far less efficiently absorbed,\ndespite an increase in efficiency due to the coupled resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2010 02:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-17"}

We then show that\ninterpolation is not always possible when $p > 2$. Specifically, for every $p >\n2$, we construct a set of different points in some $\\Rd$ for which the\ninterpolation matrix is singular.\n  The greater part of this work investigates the sensitivity of radial basis\nfunction interpolants to changes in the function values at the interpolation\npoints. Our early results show that it is possible to recast the work of Ball,\nNarcowich and Ward in the language of distributional Fourier transforms in an\nelegant way. We then use this language to study the interpolation matrices\ngenerated by subsets of regular grids. In particular, we are able to extend the\nclassical theory of Toeplitz operators to calculate sharp bounds on the spectra\nof such matrices.\n  Applying our understanding of these spectra, we construct preconditioners for\nthe conjugate gradient solution of the interpolation equations. Our main result\nis that the number of steps required to achieve solution of the linear system\nto within a required tolerance can be independent of the number of\ninterpolation points. The Toeplitz structure allows us to use fast Fourier\ntransform techniques, which imp lies that the total number of operations is a\nmultiple of $n \\log n$, where $n$ is the number of interpolation points.\n  Finally, we use some of our methods to study the behaviour of the\nmultiquadric when its shape parameter increases to infinity.

We extended the\nIBIS/ISGRI background model to take into account the Galactic Ridge X-ray\nEmission (GRXE). To suppress residual systematic artifacts on a reconstructed\nsky image we applied nonparametric sky image filtering based on wavelet\ndecomposition. The implemented modifications of the sky reconstruction method\ndecrease the systematic noise in the ~20 Ms deep field of GC by ~44%, and\npractically remove it from the high-latitude sky images. New observational data\nsets, along with an improved reconstruction algorithm, allow us to conduct the\nhard X-ray survey with the best currently available minimal sensitivity 3.7E-12\nerg/s/cm2 ~0.26 mCrab in the 17-60 keV band at a 5 sigma detection level.

We identify three\npotentially problematic assumptions.

Since the two operations\ndo not commute, KSB gives biased results. (2) KSB implicitly assumes that\ngalaxy ellipticities are small, while weak gravitational lensing assures only\nthat the change in ellipticity due to the shear is small. (3) KSB does not\ninvert the convolution with the point-spread function, but gives an approximate\nPSF correction which - even for a circular PSF - holds only in the limit of\ncircular sources. The effects of assumptions (2) and (3) partially counter-act\nin a way dependent on the width of the weight function and of the PSF.
