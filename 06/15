The simulations include the CMB, SZ effect and point sources,\nand are designed to examine the effects of point sources and the SZ effect on\npresent and recent observations of the CMB. Utilizing sets of 1,000\nsimulations, we find that the power spectrum resulting from the SZ effect is\nexpected to have a larger standard deviation by a factor of 3 than would be\nexpected from purely Gaussian realizations, and is significantly skewed towards\nincreased values for the power spectrum.

In order to put constraints on their bispectra, a logical\nfirst step is to put these into factorized form which can be achieved via the\nrecently proposed method of polynomial basis expansion on the tetrahedral\ndomain. We investigate the viability of such an expansion for the oscillatory\nbispectra and find that one needs an increasing number of orthonormal mode\nfunctions to achieve significant correlation between the expansion and the\noriginal spectrum as a function of their frequency. To reduce the number of\nmodes required, we propose a basis consisting of Fourier functions\northonormalized on the tetrahedral domain. We show that the use of Fourier mode\nfunctions instead of polynomial mode functions can lead to the necessary\nfactorizability with the use of only 1/5 of the total number of modes required\nto reconstruct the bispectra with polynomial mode functions. Moreover, from an\nobservational perspective, the expansion has unique signatures depending on the\norientation of the oscillation due to a resonance effect between the mode\nfunctions and the original spectrum. This effect opens the possibility to\nextract informa- tion about both the frequency of the bispectrum as well as its\nshape while considering only a limited number of modes. The resonance effect is\nindependent of the phase of the reconstructed bispectrum suggesting Fourier\nmode extraction could be an efficient way to detect oscillatory bispectra in\nthe data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 17:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 02:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 06:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

Robustness\nis guaranteed by requiring that the maximum sensitivity is less than or equal\nto a specified value.

We\nempirically test the robustness of neutrino mass results to these effects by\nseparately analyzing power spectra of red and blue galaxies from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) Data Release 7 (DR7), combined with the CMB\nfive-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP5) data. We consider\nfitting for a range of maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy bias\nmodels. For example, using a new model based on perturbation theory and\nincluding redshift space distortions (Saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy power\nspectrum combined with WMAP5 for a wavenumber range of k<0.2 Mpc/h yields 95%\nCL sum(m_nu)<0.46 eV. The red and blue galaxy power spectra give 0.41 and 0.63\neV respectively for this model. Using mock catalogues, we find the expected\ndifference in these limits assuming a true neutrino mass of zero is 0.10 + or -\n0.14 eV. Thus the difference of 0.22 eV between upper limits on neutrino mass\nfor red and blue galaxies is approximately 1 sigma from the expected value. We\nfind similar results for the other models and k ranges tested. This indicates\ngood agreement for current data but hints at possible issues for\nnext-generation surveys.

We calculate and present the column-density distributions\nof three clouds, modeled with very different techniques, none of which is\ndominated by supersonic turbulence. The first star-forming cloud is simulated\nusing smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH); in this case gravity, opposed only\nby thermal-pressure forces, drives the evolution. The second cloud is\nmagnetically subcritical with subsonic turbulence, simulated using nonideal\nMHD; in this case the evolution is due to gravitationally-driven ambipolar\ndiffusion. The third cloud is isothermal, self-gravitating, and has a smooth\ndensity distribution analytically approximated with a uniform inner region and\nan r^-2 profile at larger radii. We show that in all three cases the\ncolumn-density distributions are lognormal. Power-law tails develop only at\nlate times (or, in the case of the smooth analytic profile, for strongly\ncentrally concentrated configurations), when gravity dominates all opposing\nforces. It therefore follows that lognormal column-density distributions are\ngeneric features of diverse model clouds, and should not be interpreted as\nbeing a consequence of supersonic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 20:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\nfrequency-dependent SZ temperature fluctuations, with thermal (TSZ) and kinetic\n(KSZ) contributions, are calculated by tracing through a dark matter\nsimulation, processed to include gas in dark matter halos and in the\nfilamentary intergalactic medium. Different halo gas models are compared to\nstudy how star formation, energetic feedback, and nonthermal pressure support\ninfluence the angular power spectrum. The standard model has been calibrated to\nreproduce the stellar and gas fractions and X-ray scaling relations measured\nfrom low redshift clusters and groups. The other models illustrate the current\ntheoretical and empirical uncertainties relating to properties of the\nintracluster medium. Relative to the standard model, their angular power\nspectra differ by approximately 50% (TSZ), 20% (KSZ), and 40% (SZ at 148 GHz)\nfor l=3000, sigma_8=0.8, and homogeneous reionization at z=10. The angular\npower spectrum decreases in amplitude as gas mass and binding energy is removed\nthrough star formation, and as gas is pushed out to larger radii by energetic\nfeedback. With nonthermal pressure support, less pressure is required to\nmaintain hydrostatic equilibrium, thus reducing the thermal contribution to the\nSZ power. We also calculate the SZ templates as a function of sigma_8 and\nquantify this dependence. Assuming C_l is proprotional to (sigma_8/0.8)^alpha,\nthe effective scaling index ranges from 7<alpha_tsz<9, 4.5<alpha_ksz<5.5, and\n6.5<alpha_sz(148 GHz)<8 at l=3000 for 0.6<sigma_8<1.

The key to the quantum topological order is the coexistence of\nspin-orbit coupling with proximity-induced s-wave superconductivity and an\nexternally-induced Zeeman coupling of the spins. For the Zeeman coupling below\na critical value, the system is a non-topological (proximity-induced) s-wave\nsuperconductor. However, for a range of Zeeman coupling above the critical\nvalue, the lowest energy excited state inside a vortex is a zero-energy\nMajorana fermion state. The system, thus, has entered into a non-Abelian s-wave\nsuperconducting state via a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) tuned\nby the Zeeman coupling. In the one-dimensional version of the same structure\nand for the Zeeman coupling above the critical value, there are localized\nMajorana zero-energy modes at the two ends of a semiconducting quantum\nnanowire. In this case, the Zeeman coupling can be induced more easily by an\nexternal magnetic field parallel to the wire, obviating the need for a magnetic\ninsulator. We show that, despite the fact that the superconducting pair\npotential in the nanowire is explicitly s-wave, tunneling of electrons to the\nends of the wire reveals a pronounced zero-bias peak. Such a peak is absent\nwhen the Zeeman coupling is below its critical value, i.e., the nanowire is in\nthe non-topological s-wave superconducting state.

We demonstrate that previous\nempirical photometric calibrations of M dwarf metallicity exploiting this\ncorrelation systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the\nextremes of their range. We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways.\nWe use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs\nfrom the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M\ndwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood, we use theoretical models of M dwarf\ninteriors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in\nthe V-K_s--M_Ks CMD, and we base our final calibration purely on\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions. As a\nresult, we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the\ncalibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. We\nnon-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs\nthat host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane\npopulated by metal-rich M dwarfs. We find that the probability p that\nplanet-hosting M dwarfs are distributed across the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD in the same\nway as field M dwarfs is p = 0.06 +/- 0.008.

To illustrate the first point, we focus on the\nlarge-scale, wind-driven flow of the mid-latitude oceans which contribute in a\ncrucial way to Earth's climate, and to changes therein. We study the\nlow-frequency variability (LFV) of the wind-driven, double-gyre circulation in\nmid-latitude ocean basins, via the bifurcation sequence that leads from steady\nstates through periodic solutions and on to the chaotic, irregular flows\ndocumented in the observations. This sequence involves local, pitchfork and\nHopf bifurcations, as well as global, homoclinic ones. The natural climate\nvariability induced by the LFV of the ocean circulation is but one of the\ncauses of uncertainties in climate projections. Another major cause of such\nuncertainties could reside in the structural instability in the topological\nsense, of the equations governing climate dynamics, including but not\nrestricted to those of atmospheric and ocean dynamics. We propose a novel\napproach to understand, and possibly reduce, these uncertainties, based on the\nconcepts and methods of random dynamical systems theory. As a very first step,\nwe study the effect of noise on the topological classes of the Arnol'd family\nof circle maps, a paradigmatic model of frequency locking as occurring in the\nnonlinear interactions between the El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) and the\nseasonal cycle. It is shown that the maps' fine-grained resonant landscape is\nsmoothed by the noise, thus permitting their coarse-grained classification.\nThis result is consistent with stabilizing effects of stochastic\nparametrization obtained in modeling of ENSO phenomenon via some general\ncirculation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 00:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

These galaxies are selected among faint infrared sources (0.14\n- 0.5 mJy at 24 um) in two redshift bins (0.76-1.05 and 1.75-2.4) to sample the\nmajor contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs.\nWe estimate redshifts for 92% of the sample using PAH and Si absorption\nfeatures. Only few of these galaxies (5% at z~1 and 12% at z~2) have their\ntotal infrared luminosity dominated by emission from AGN. The averaged mid-IR\nspectra of the z~1 LIRGs and of the z~2 ULIRGs are very similar to the averaged\nspectrum of local starbursts and HII-like ULIRGs, respectively. We find that\n6.2um PAH equivalent widths reach a plateau of ~1 um for L(24 mu) < 1E11\nL(sun). At higher luminosities, EW (6.2 mu) anti-correlates with L(24 um).\nIntriguingly, high-z ULIRGs and SMG lie above the local EW (6.2 um) - L(24 um)\nrelationship suggesting that, at a given luminosity, high-z ULIRGs have AGN\ncontributions to their dust emission lower than those of local counterparts.

As concrete models, we investigate\nseveral cases where the internal spaces are weighted projective spaces. The\nmodels we consider have two, three, or four K\\\"{a}hler moduli. The K\\\"{a}hler\nmoduli play a role of inflaton fields and we consider the cases where only one\nof the moduli behaves as the inflaton field. For the cases with more than two\nmoduli, we choose the diagonal basis for the expression of the Calabi-Yau\nvolume, which can be written down as a function of four-cycle. With the\ncombination of multiple moduli, we can express the multi-dimensional problem as\nan effective one-dimensional problem. In the large volume scenario, the\npotentials of these three models turn out to be of the same type. By taking the\nspecific limit of the relation between the moduli and the volume, the\npotentials are reduced to simpler ones which induce inflation. As a toy model\nwe first consider the simple potential. We calculate the slow roll parameters\n$\\epsilon$, $\\eta$ and $\\xi$ for each inflationary potential.

Of particular practical importance is to find\ntile systems that minimize resources such as the number of distinct tile types,\neach of which corresponds to a set of DNA strands that must be\ncustom-synthesized in actual molecular implementations of the aTAM. We seek to\nidentify to what extent the use of nondeterminism in tile systems affects the\nresources required by such molecular shape-building algorithms.\n  We first show a \"molecular computability theoretic\" result: there is an\ninfinite shape S that is uniquely assembled by a tile system but not by any\ndeterministic tile system. We then show an analogous phenomenon in the finitary\n\"molecular complexity theoretic\" case: there is a finite shape S that is\nuniquely assembled by a tile system with c tile types, but every deterministic\ntile system that uniquely assembles S has more than c tile types. In fact we\nextend the technique to derive a stronger (classical complexity theoretic)\nresult, showing that the problem of finding the minimum number of tile types\nthat uniquely assemble a given finite shape is Sigma-P-2-complete. In contrast,\nthe problem of finding the minimum number of deterministic tile types that\nuniquely assemble a shape was shown to be NP-complete by Adleman, Cheng, Goel,\nHuang, Kempe, Moisset de Espan\\'es, and Rothemund (Combinatorial Optimization\nProblems in Self-Assembly, STOC 2002).\n  The conclusion is that nondeterminism confers extra power to assemble a shape\nfrom a small tile system, but unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, it is\ncomputationally more difficult to exploit this power by finding the size of the\nsmallest tile system, compared to finding the size of the smallest\ndeterministic tile system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 06:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 21:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 17:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

Recently, theoretical models and experimental evidence show\nthat costly punishment may facilitate cooperation in human societies, but may\nnot be used by winners. The puzzle how the costly punishment behaviour evolves\ncan be solved under voluntary participation. Could the punishers emerge if\nparticipation is compulsory? Is the punishment inevitably a selfish behaviour\nor an altruistic behaviour? The motivations behind punishment are still an\nenigma. Based on public goods interactions, we present a model in which just a\ncertain portion of the public good is divided equally among all members. The\nother portion is distributed to contributors when paying a second cost.\nContributors who are willing to pay a second cost can be costly (and then\naltruistic) punishers, but they can also flourish or dominate the population,\nin this case we may call them \"advantageous punishers\". We argue that most of\nsuccessful cooperators and punishers in nature are advantageous punishers, and\ncostly punishment mostly happens in humans. This indicates a universal\nsurviving rule: contributing more and gaining more. Our models show\ntheoretically that the original motivation behind punishment is to retrieve\ndeserved payoff from their own contributions, a selfish incentive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 09:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

We derive a\nradius of the planet of 0.97 +/- 0.07 R_Jup and a mass of 2.75 +/- 0.16 M_Jup.\nThe bulk density, rho_pl=3.70 +/- 0.83 g/cm^3, is ~2.8 that of Jupiter. The\ncore of CoRoT-10b could contain up to 240 M_Earth of heavy elements. Moving\nalong its eccentric orbit, the planet experiences a 10.6-fold variation in\ninsolation. Owing to the long circularisation time, tau_circ > 7 Gyr, a\nresonant perturber is not required to excite and maintain the high eccentricity\nof CoRoT-10b.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 10:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-30"}

The Swift/X-ray Telescope (XRT) started observing the source after less than\n100 s since the BAT trigger, when the flux (about 6E-11 erg/cm^2/s in the 2-10\nkeV range) was >50 times higher than its quiescent level. Swift monitored the\noutbursting activity of 1E 1547.0-5408 on a daily basis for approximately three\nweeks. This strategy allowed us to find a phase-coherent solution for the\nsource pulsations after the burst, which, besides period and period derivative,\nrequires a positive Period second derivative term (spin-down increase). The\ntime evolution of the pulse shape is complex and variable, with the pulsed\nfraction increasing from 20% to 50% within the Swift observational window. The\nXRT spectra can be fitted well by means of a single component, either a\npower-law (PL) or a blackbody (BB). During the very initial phases of the\noutburst the spectrum is hard, with a PL photon index about 2 (or kT about 1.4\nkeV) which steepens to about 4 (or kT about 0.8 keV) within one day from the\nBAT trigger, though the two components are likely present simultaneously during\nthe first day spectra. An INTEGRAL observation carried out five days after the\ntrigger provided an upper limit of about 2E-11 erg/cm^2/s to the emission of 1E\n1547.0-5408 in the 18-60 keV band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 10:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In\nparticular, proofs of conjectures of (1) Gillet-Soul\\'e and Fang (concerning\nthe regularized determinant of Dolbeault Laplacians on the two-sphere) (2)\nTarantello and (3) Aubin (concerning Moser-Trudinger type inequalities) in\nthese three settings are obtained. New proofs of some results in Kahler\ngeometry are also obtained, including a lower bound on Mabuchi's K-energy and\nthe uniqueness result for Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds of\nBando-Mabuchi. This paper is a substantially extended version of the preprint\narXiv:0905.4263 which it supersedes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 13:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

The interpretation of high-resolution sunspot\nwave observations requires modeling of three-dimensional non-linear wave\npropagation and mode transformation in the sunspot upper layers in realistic\nspot model atmospheres. Here we present the first results of such modeling. We\nhave developed a 3D non-linear numerical code specially designed to calculate\nthe response of magnetic structures in equilibrium to an arbitrary\nperturbation. The code solves the 3D nonlinear MHD equations for perturbations;\nit is stabilized by hyper-diffusivity terms and is fully parallelized. The\nrobustness of the code is demonstrated by a number of standard tests. We\nanalyze several simulations of a sunspot perturbed by pulses of different\nperiods at subphotospheric level, from short periods, introduced for academic\npurposes, to longer and realistic periods of three and five minutes. We present\na detailed description of the three-dimensional mode transformation in a\nnon-trivial sunspot-like magnetic field configuration, including the conversion\nbetween fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves and the Alfv\\'en wave, by\ncalculation of the wave energy fluxes. Our main findings are the following: (1)\nthe conversion from acoustic to the Alfv\\'en mode is only observed if the the\ndriving pulse is located out of the sunspot axis, but this conversion is\nenergetically inefficient; (2) as a consequence of the cut-off effects and\nrefraction of the fast magneto-acoustic mode, the energy of the evanescent\nwaves with periods around 5 minutes remains almost completely below the level\nbeta=1; (3) waves with frequencies above the cut-off propagate field-aligned to\nthe chromosphere and their power becomes dominating over that of evanescent\n5-minute oscillations, in agreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 14:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In particular, we give a\nsimple bijection between matchings with no 2-nestings and inversion tables with\nno subsequence of decreasing consecutive numbers. We then prove using the\ninvolution principle that inversion tables with no subsequence of decreasing\nconsecutive numbers have the same generating function as the Fishburn numbers.\nThe Fishburn numbers have previously been shown by Bousquet-M\\'elou, Claesson,\nDukes and Kitaev to enumerate $\\textbf{(2+2)}$-avoiding posets, matchings with\nno left- or right-nestings, permutations avoiding a particular pattern, and\nso-called ascent sequences, and by Dukes and Parviainen to enumerate upper\ntriangular matrices with non-negative entries and no empty rows or columns.\nClaesson and Linusson conjectured they also enumerated matchings with no\n2-nestings. Using these new interpretations of the Fishburn numbers and another\nversion of the involution, we prove the conjectured equality (also proven using\nmatrices by Jel\\'{\\i}nek and by Yan) of two refinements by Remmel and Kitaev of\nthe Fishburn generating function. In an appendix, we state and prove another\nconjecture of Claesson and Linusson giving the distribution of left-nestings\nover the set of all matchings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 15:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

In addition, we perform a\ncareful sensitivity analysis of LEDBAT performance, by tuning its main\nparameters in both inter-protocol (against TCP) and intra-protocol (against\nLEDBAT itself) scenarios. In the inter-protocol case, although in case of\nmisconfiguration LEDBAT competes as aggressively as TCP, however we show that\nit is not possible to achieve an arbitrary level of low-priority by merely\ntuning its parameters.

The latter setting contains also\nstring-localized charge-carrying operators whereas the gauge theoretic\nformulation is limited to point-like generated observables. This description\nalso gives a much better insight into the Higgs mechanism which leads to a\nrevival of the more physical \"Schwinger-Higgs\" screening idea.
