Because of the extreme mass-ratio, one can model these systems\nusing perturbation theory. However, in order to relate the motion of the small\nbody to the emitted waveform, one requires a model that is accurate on\nextremely long timescales. Additionally, in order to avoid intractable\ndivergences, one requires a model that treats the small body as asymptotically\nsmall rather than exactly pointlike. Both of these difficulties can be resolved\nby using techniques of singular perturbation theory. I begin this dissertation\nwith an analysis of singular perturbation theory on manifolds, including the\ncommon techniques of matched asymptotic expansions and two-timescale\nexpansions. I then formulate a systematic asymptotic expansion in which the\nmetric perturbation due to the body is expanded while a representative\nworldline is held fixed, and I contrast it with a regular expansion in which\nboth the metric and the worldline must be expanded. This results in an\napproximation that is potentially uniformly accurate on long timescales. The\nequation of motion for the body's fixed worldline is determined by performing a\nlocal-in-space expansion in the neighbourhood of the body. Using this local\nexpansion as boundary data, I construct a global solution to the perturbative\nEinstein equation. To concretely characterize orbits, I next devise a\nrelativistic generalization of the Newtonian method of osculating orbits.\nMaking use of this method and two-timescale expansions, I examine the utility\nof adiabatic approximations that can forgo an explicit calculation of the\nforce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2010 02:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-22"}

Both studies have\nproved useful for identifying the effect of interactions on galaxies. In the\nNIR, the properties of the galaxies in HCGs, KPGs, and KIGs are more similar\nthan they are in the optical. This is because the NIR band traces the older\nstellar populations, which formed earlier and are more relaxed than the younger\npopulations. However, we found asymmetries related to interactions in both KPG\nand HCG samples. In HCGs, the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is even higher\nthan what we found in the optical. In the KPGs the interactions look like very\nrecent events, while in the HCGs galaxies are more morphologically evolved and\nshow properties suggesting they suffered more frequent interactions. The key\ndifference seems to be the absence of star formation in the HCGs; while\ninteractions produce intense star formation in the KPGs, we do not see this\neffect in the HCGs. This is consistent with the dry merger hypothesis (Coziol &\nPlauchu-Frayn 2007); the interaction between galaxies in compact groups, (CGs),\nis happening without the presence of gas. If the gas was spent in stellar\nformation (to build the bulge of the numerous early-type galaxies), then the\nHCGs possibly started interacting sometime before the KPGs. On the other hand,\nthe dry interaction condition in CGs suggests that the galaxies are on merging\norbits, and consequently such system cannot be that much older either.\n[abridge]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2010 04:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 18:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\nexperimental AFM force curves from coexisting liquid ordered and liquid\ndisordered domains in 3-component lipid bilayers are well-described by our\nmodel, and provides $\\kappa_A$ in agreement with literature values. The liquid\nordered phase has a yield like response that we model by hydrogen bond\nbreaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2010 15:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 21:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

As an application we show that the corresponding modular\ninvariant partition function is given by permutation by g.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2010 15:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-22"}
