We drive the simulation with surface maps for\nthe radial magnetic field obtained from a stellar dynamo model of the FK Com\nsystem. This enables us to obtain the coronal structure for different field\ntopologies representing different periods of time. We find that the corona of\nsuch an FK Com-like star, including the large scale coronal loops, is dominated\nby a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field. This is a result of part\nof the field being dragged by the radial outflow, while the other part remains\nattached to the rapidly rotating stellar surface. This tangling of the magnetic\nfield,in addition to a reduction in the radial flow component, leads to a\nflattening of the gas density profile with distance in the inner part of the\ncorona. The three-dimensional simulation provides a global view of the coronal\nstructure. Some aspects of the results, such as the toroidal wrapping of the\nmagnetic field, should also be applicable to coronae on fast rotators in\ngeneral, which our study shows can be considerably different from the\nwell-studied and well-observed solar corona. Studying the global structure of\nsuch coronae should also lead to a better understanding of their related\nstellar processes, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, and in\nparticular, should lead to an improved understanding of mass and angular\nmomentum loss from such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 16:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By using a\nswap Monte Carlo algorithm we measure the equilibration time of a liquid\ndroplet bounded by amorphous boundary conditions in a model glass-former at low\ntemperature, and we show that the cavity relaxation time increases with the\nsize of the droplet, saturating to the bulk value when the droplet outgrows the\npoint-to-set correlation length.

These spectral splits depend\nnot only on the mass hierarchy of the neutrinos but also on the initial\nrelative flux composition. Observation of spectral splits in a future galactic\nsupernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of\nthe neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB)\ncomprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and\nsince different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial\nfluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of\ncollective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra. Since\nthe actual distribution of SN with initial relative flux spectra of the\nneutrinos and antineutrinos is unknown, we assume a log-normal distribution for\nthem. We study the dependence of the hierarchy sensitivity to the mean and\nvariance of the log-normal distribution function.

The effect of the width is to reduce the hierarchy sensitivity for\nall values of the mean initial relative luminosity.

We\nhave carried out a survey for supernovae (SNe) in galaxy clusters, at a\nredshift range 0.5<z<0.9, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the\nHubble Space Telescope. We reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that were\npreviously imaged by ACS, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, in\nwhich we discovered five likely cluster SNe, six possible cluster SNe Ia, two\nhostless SN candidates, and several background and foreground events. Keck\nspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. We\nconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellar\nluminosities of the clusters using Subaru images. We derive a cluster SN rate\nof 0.35 SNuB +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \\pm0.13 (classification) \\pm0.01\n(systematic) [where SNuB = SNe (100 yr 10^10 L_B_sun)^-1] and 0.112 SNuM\n+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \\pm0.042 (classification) \\pm0.005 (systematic)\n[where SNuM = SNe (100 yr 10^10 M_sun)^-1]. As in previous measurements of\ncluster SN rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.\nThe SN rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the SN rate in clusters at\nlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, at\nmost, only a slight increase of cluster SN rate with increasing redshift. The\nlow and fairly constant SN Ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the iron\nmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. The recently observed doubling of\niron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, is\nlikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than new\nproduction of iron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 17:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

For discs with a\npure toroidal field, the corotation resonance is split into two magnetic\nresonances, where the wave frequency in the corotating frame of the fluid,\n$\\tomega=\\omega-m\\Omega$, matches the slow magnetosonic wave frequency.\nSignificant wave energy/angular momentum absorption occurs at both magnetic\nresonances, but with opposite signs. The combined effect of the two magnetic\nresonances is to reduce the super-reflection and the growth rate of the\noverstable p-modes. We show that even a subthermal toroidal field may suppress\nthe overstability of hydrodynamic (B=0) p-modes. For accretion discs with mixed\n(toroidal and vertical) magnetic fields, two additional Alfven resonances\nappear, where $\\tomega$ matches the local Alfven wave frequency.

In order to shed light on\nthese issues, we investigate the state-of-the-art models of Hubeny et al. that\ndescribe the continuum spectrum of thin accretion discs and include\nrelativistic effects. We explore the bolometric corrections as a function of\nmass accretion rates, black hole masses and viewing angles, restricted to the\nparameter space expected for type-1 quasars. We find that a nonlinear\nrelationship log L_bol=A + B log(lambda L_lambda) with B<=0.9 is favoured by\nthe models and becomes tighter as the wavelength decreases. We calculate from\nthe model the bolometric corrections corresponding to the wavelengths lambda =\n1450A, 3000A and 5100A. In particular, for lambda=3000A we find A=9.24 +- 0.77\nand B=0.81 +- 0.02. We demonstrate that the often-made assumption that quasars\nemit isotropically may lead to severe systematic errors in the determination of\nL_bol, when using the method of integrating the \"big blue bump\" spectrum. For a\ntypical viewing angle of ~30 degrees to the quasar central engine, we obtain\nthat the value of L_bol resulting from the isotropy assumption has a systematic\nerror of ~30% high compared to the value of L_bol which incorporates the\nanisotropic emission of the accretion disc.

I concentrate on\nmatter-twin-matter-symmetric versions of BIMOND, and assume that, on average,\nthe universe is symmetrically populated in the two sectors. MOND effects are\nabsent in an exactly symmetric universe, apart from the appearance of a\ncosmological constant, Lambda~(a0/c)^2. MOND effects-local and cosmological-do\nenter when density inhomogeneities that differ in the two sectors appear and\ndevelop. MOND later takes its standard form in systems that are islands\ndominated by pure matter. I derive the nonrelativistic equations governing\nsmall-scale fluctuation growth. The equations split into two uncoupled systems,\none for the sum, the other for the difference, of the fluctuations in the two\nsectors. The former is governed strictly by Newtonian dynamics. The latter is\ngoverned by MOND dynamics, which entails stronger gravity, and nonlinearity\neven for the smallest of perturbations. These cause the difference to grow\nfaster than the sum, conducing to matter-twin-matter segregation. The\nnonlinearity also causes interaction between nested perturbations on different\nscales. Because matter and twin matter (TM) repel each other in the MOND\nregime, matter inhomogeneities grow not only by their own self gravity, but\nalso through shepherding by flanking TM overdensitie. The relative importance\nof gravity and pressure in the MOND system depends also on the strength of the\nperturbation. The development of structure in the universe, in either sector,\nthus depends crucially on two initial fluctuation spectra: that of matter alone\nand that of the matter-TM difference. I also discuss the back reaction on\ncosmology of BIMOND effects that appear as \"phantom matter\" resulting from\ninhomogeneity differences between the two sectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 21:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 10:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 11:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

One possible mechanism for producing high ions is turbulent mixing of\ncool gas with hotter gas in locations where these gases slide past each other.\nBy using hydrodynamic simulations with radiative cooling and non-equilibrium\nionization (NEI) calculations, we investigate the physical properties of\nturbulent mixing layers and the production of high ions. We find that most of\nthe mixing occurs on the hot side of the hot/cool interface and that the mixed\nregion separates into a tepid zone containing radiatively cooled, C IV-rich gas\nand a hotter zone which is rich in C IV, N V, and O VI. Mixing occurs faster\nthan ionization or recombination, making the mixed gas a better source of C IV,\nN V, and O VI in our NEI simulations than in our collisional ionization\nequilibrium (CIE) simulations. In addition, the gas radiatively cools faster\nthan the ions recombine, which also allows large numbers of high ions to linger\nin the NEI simulations. For these reasons, our NEI calculations predict more\nhigh ions than our CIE calculations predict. We also simulate various initial\nconfigurations of turbulent mixing layers and discuss their results. We compare\nthe results of our simulations with observations and other models, including\nother turbulent mixing calculations. The ratios of C IV to N V and N V to O VI\nare in reasonable agreement with the averages calculated from observations of\nthe halo. There is a great deal of variation from sightline to sightline and\nwith time in our simulations.

In this paper, we study in detail the\nnature of a subsample of disk-bearing stars that show peculiar characteristics.\nThey appear older than the other members in the V vs. V-I diagram, and/or they\nhave one or more IRAC colors at pure photospheric values, despite showing NIR\nexcesses, when optical and infrared colors are compared.

We show that the age of these stars estimated from\nthe V vs. V-I diagram is unreliable since their V-I colors are altered by the\nlight scattered by the disk into the line of sight. Only in a few cases their\nSEDs are compatible with models with excesses in V band caused by optical\nveiling.

In 1/3 of these cases, scattering\nof stellar flux by the disks can also be invoked. The photospheric light\nscattered by the disk grains into the line of sight can affect the derivation\nof physical parameters of ClassII stars from photometric optical and NIR data.\nBesides, the disks diagnostic we defined are useful for selecting stars with\ndisks, even those with moderate excesses or whose optical colors are altered by\nveiling or photospheric scattered light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2010 21:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Mott explained this for monovalent carriers by\nassuming that monovalent ions and electrons are the bulk charge carriers, and\nthat their number fluxes vary as t^{-1/2} at sufficiently long t. In this\ntheory no charge is present in the bulk, and surface charges were not\ndiscussed. However, it can be analyzed in terms of a discharging capacitor,\nwith the oxide surfaces as the plates. The theory is inconsistent because the\nfield decreases, corresponding to discharge, but there is no net current to\ncause discharge. The present work, which also includes non-monovalent carriers,\nsystematically extends the theory and obtains the discharge current. Because\nthe Planck-Nernst equations are nonlinear (although Gauss's Law and the\ncontinuity equations are linear) this leads to a systematic order-by-order\nexpansion in powers of t^{-1/2} for the number currents, concentrations, and\nelectric field during oxide growth. At higher order the bulk develops a\nnon-zero charge density, with a corresponding non-uniform net current, and\nthere are corrections to the electric field and the ion currents. The second\norder correction to ion current implies a logarithmic term in the thickness of\nthe oxide layer: L = (2At)^{1/2} + B ln t + . . . .

We explore how the\nsimultaneous growth of two embryos at the present locations of Jupiter and\nSaturn affects the outcome of planetary formation. We model planet formation on\nthe basis of the core accretion scenario and include several key physical\ningredients. We consider a protoplanetary gas disk that exponentially decays\nwith time. For planetesimals, we allow for a distribution of sizes from 100~m\nto 100~km with most of the mass in the smaller objects. We include planetesimal\nmigration as well as different profiles for the surface density $\\Sigma$ of the\ndisk. The core growth is computed in the framework of the oligarchic growth\nregime and includes the viscous enhancement of the planetesimal capture\ncross-section. Planet migration is ignored. By comparing calculations assuming\nformation of embryos in isolation to calculations with simultaneous embryo\ngrowth, we find that the growth of one embryo generally significantly affects\nthe other. This occurs in spite of the feeding zones of each planet never\noverlapping. The results may be classified as a function of the gas surface\ndensity profile $\\Sigma$: if $\\Sigma \\propto r^{-3/2}$ and the protoplanetary\ndisk is rather massive, Jupiter's formation inhibits the growth of Saturn.

We investigate whether the\nlarge dispersion in the observed lithium abundances of solar-analog stars can\nbe explained by the depth behavior of the outer convective zone masses, within\nthe framework of the standard convection model based on the local mixing-length\ntheory. We also aims to analyze the link between rotation and lithium abundance\nin solar-analog stars.

From these models, the stellar mass, age, and mass depth of\nthe outer convective zone were estimated for 117 solar-analog stars, using Teff\nand [Fe/H] available in the literature, and the new HIPPARCOS trigonometric\nparallax measurements. We determine the age and mass of the outer convective\nzone for a bona fide sample of 117 solar-analog stars. No significant on-to-one\ncorrelation is found between the computed convection zone mass and published\nlithium abundance, indicating that the large A(Li) dispersion in solar analogs\ncannot be explained by the classical framework of envelope convective mixing\ncoupled with lithium depletion at the bottom of the convection zone. These\nresults illustrate the need for an extra-mixing process to explain lithium\nbehavior in solar-analog stars, such as, shear mixing caused by differential\nrotation.

While this is true in\nterms of its simplicity and universal applicability, the resulting approach\nsuffers from the presence of temporal correlations of successive samples\nnaturally implied by the Markov chain underlying the importance-sampling\nsimulation. In many situations, these autocorrelations are moderate and can be\neasily accounted for by an appropriately adapted analysis of simulation data.\nThey turn out to be a major hurdle, however, in the vicinity of phase\ntransitions or for systems with complex free-energy landscapes. The critical\nslowing down close to continuous transitions is most efficiently reduced by the\napplication of cluster algorithms, where they are available. For first-order\ntransitions and disordered systems, on the other hand, macroscopic energy\nbarriers need to be overcome to prevent dynamic ergodicity breaking. In this\nsituation, generalized-ensemble techniques such as the multicanonical\nsimulation method can effect impressive speedups, allowing to sample the full\nfree-energy landscape. The Potts model features continuous as well as\nfirst-order phase transitions and is thus a prototypic example for studying\nphase transitions and new algorithmic approaches. I discuss the possibilities\nof bringing together cluster and generalized-ensemble methods to combine the\nbenefits of both techniques. The resulting algorithm allows for the efficient\nestimation of the random-cluster partition function encoding the information of\nall Potts models, even with a non-integer number of states, for all\ntemperatures in a single simulation run per system size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2010 12:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-22"}
