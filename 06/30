Unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection is similar to\ncompact toroid injection but with much higher plasma density and total mass,\nand consequently lower required injection velocity. Mass deposition of the jet\ninto the background appears to be facilitated via magnetic reconnection along\nthe jet's trailing edge.

The system uses the\nfixed-queue-ratio-with-thresholds (FQR-T) control, which we proposed in a\nrecent paper as a way for one service system to help another in face of an\nunexpected overload. Under FQR-T, customers are served by their own service\npool until a threshold is exceeded. Then, one-way sharing is activated with\ncustomers from one class allowed to be served in both pools. After the control\nis activated, it aims to keep the two queues at a pre-specified fixed ratio.\nFor large systems that fixed ratio is achieved approximately. For the fluid\nlimit, or FWLLN, we consider a sequence of properly scaled X models in overload\noperating under FQR-T. Our proof of the FWLLN follows the compactness approach,\ni.e., we show that the sequence of scaled processes is tight, and then show\nthat all converging subsequences have the specified limit. The characterization\nstep is complicated because the queue-difference processes, which determine the\ncustomer-server assignments, remain stochastically bounded, and need to be\nconsidered without spatial scaling. Asymptotically, these queue-difference\nprocesses operate in a faster time scale than the fluid-scaled processes. In\nthe limit, due to a separation of time scales, the driving processes converge\nto a time-dependent steady state (or local average) of a time-varying\nfast-time-scale process (FTSP). This averaging principle (AP) allows us to\nreplace the driving processes with the long-run average behavior of the FTSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 17:55:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 16:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2011 15:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 23:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-24"}

Self-consistent stellar evolution models of 1.3\nto 2.5 M_sun stars including atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations for\nall species within the OPAL opacity database were computed with mass loss and\ncompared to observations as well as previous calculations with turbulent\nmixing. Models with unseparated mass loss rates between 5 x 10^-14 and 10^-13\nM_sun/yr reproduce observations for many cluster AmFm stars as well as Sirius A\nand o Leonis.

In particular, in the current theoretical paradigm of\ngalaxy formation, AGN feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulating\nthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at low\nredshift. Only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical information\non the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass and\nhierarchy has become available. In this paper, we compare the fractions of\ngalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, AGN and radio\nactive) with predictions from four different and independently developed\nsemi-analytical models. We adopt empirical relations to convert physical\nproperties into observables (H_alpha emission lines, OIII line strength and\nradio power). We demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce the\noverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as a\nfunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongest\nradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-mass\ngalaxies/halos respectively. However, model predictions differ from\nobservational measurements in a number of ways. All models used in our study\npredict that almost every >1.e12 Msun dark matter halo and/or >1.e11 Msun\ngalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction of\ngalaxies belong to this class in the data. In addition, radio brightness is\nexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,\nwhile strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.\nOur results highlight that the distribution of AGN as a function of stellar\nmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gas\naccretion schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 20:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 13:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at\n5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the\nPSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a\nmicroscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an\nover-resolved MIRIM PSF. The microscanning consists in a sub-pixel scan of a\npoint source on the focal plane. A data inversion method is used to reconstruct\nPSF images that are over-resolved by a factor of 7 compared to the native\nresolution of MIRI. We show that the FWHM of the high-resolution PSFs were\n5-10% wider than that obtained with Zemax simulations. The main cause was\nidentified as an out-of-specification tilt of the M4 mirror.

Here we turn our attention to the SMC, where the metallicity is 10x\nlower than that of M31, which is important as metallicity strongly affects\nmassive star evolution. The SMC's large radial velocity (~160 km/s) allows us\nto separate members from foreground stars.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the moss is\nunipolar, the spatial distribution of magnetic flux evolves slowly, and the\nmagnetic field is only moderately inclined. We show that the field line\ninclination and horizontal component are coherent, and that the magnetic field\nis mostly sheared in the inter-moss regions where the highest magnetic flux\nvariability is seen. Using extrapolations from SP magnetograms we show that the\nmagnetic connectivity in the moss is different than in the quiet Sun because\nmost of the magnetic field extends to significant coronal heights. The magnetic\nflux, field vector, and chromospheric emission in the moss also appear highly\ndynamic, but actually show only small scale variations in magnitude on\ntime-scales longer than the cooling times for hydrodynamic loops computed from\nour extrapolations, suggesting high-frequency (continuous) heating events. Some\nevidence is found for flux (Ca 2 intensity) changes on the order of 100--200 G\n(DN) on time-scales of 20--30 mins that could be taken as indicative of\nlow-frequency heating. We find, however, that only a small fraction (10%) of\nour simulated loops would be expected to cool on these time-scales, and we find\nno clear evidence that the flux changes consistently produce intensity changes\nin the chromosphere. The magnetic flux and chromospheric intensity in most\nindividual SOT pixels in the moss vary by less than ~ 20% and ~ 10%,\nrespectively, on loop cooling time-scales. In view of the high energy\nrequirements of the chromosphere, we suggest that these variations could be\nsufficient for the heating of `warm' EUV loops, but that the high basal levels\nmay be more important for powering the hot core loops rooted in the moss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 06:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Specifically, it is the combined\npressure from the baryon thermal motions and the residual long-range\nelectrostatic potentials resulted from the imperfect Debye shielding, that\nfights against the gravitational collapse. As a result, at small-scales the\nbaryons would oscillate at the ion-acoustic, instead of the conventional\nneutral acoustic, frequency. In this paper we extend and improve the Chen-Lai\nformulation with the attention to the Landau damping of the ion-acoustic\noscillations. Since T_e \\sim T_i in the post-reionization era, the ion acoustic\noscillations would inevitably suffer the Landau damping which severely\nsuppresses the baryon density spectrum in the regimes of intermediate and high\nwavenumber k. To describe this Landau-damping phenomenon more appropriately, we\nfind it necessary to modify the filtering wavenumber k_f in our analysis. It\nwould be interesting if our predicted Landau damping of the ion-acoustic\noscillations can be observed at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 06:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01"}

Supervisor: Graham Kirby","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.SE","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  The ever-increasing complexity of software systems makes them hard to\ncomprehend, predict and tune due to emergent properties and non-deterministic\nbehaviour. Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide\nvariety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms\nand communication policies leads to ever more complex performance\ncharacteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour\nunder different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be\nconfigurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various\nstakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately\npredict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most\nappropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated\nexperiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can\nfind configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting\nbehavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's\nbehaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running\nsuch experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for\ndeciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is\ndiscussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have\nbeen used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for\nconfiguring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case\nstudy, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a\nproduct from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the\napplicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.\nTaguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-\nDirectory, making them a valuable addition to the techniques available to\nsystem administrators and developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 08:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01"}

These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks\nalong faults. The type and orientation of faults are usually determined under\nthe assumption of a constant lithospheric thickness, but lithospheric thinning\ncan occur at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in\nsolar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells\nwith variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere\ntransforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by\ncontraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably\nformed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations\nonly weakly affect the despinning faulting pattern consisting of equatorial\nstrike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to\ndespinning, the despinning pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking\nnorth-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is\nthinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion\nconsists of faults striking north/south. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion\non a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation\nof the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and\ndespinning makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults\ndiffering in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to\nthe orientation of lobate scarps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 09:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09"}

We briefly review a variety of approaches for using data\nto construct the decision rules. We then review an interesting challenge, that\nof nonregularity that often arises in this area. By nonregularity, we mean the\nparameters indexing the optimal dynamic treatment regime are nonsmooth\nfunctionals of the underlying generative distribution.\n  A consequence is that no regular or asymptotically unbiased estimator of\nthese parameters exists. Nonregularity arises in inference for parameters in\nthe optimal dynamic treatment regime; we illustrate the effect of nonregularity\non asymptotic bias and via sensitivity of asymptotic, limiting, distributions\nto local perturbations.

The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on\nthe length of the pore: For very long pores the system is axially homogeneous\nat low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place\nfluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder as\na whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality)\nthe system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multi-domain\nstate, where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the\nAsakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between these\ntwo different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density\ndistribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak\nshape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibrium\ndomain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded)\ntransition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial\ncorrelation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder\ndiameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the\ntransition from the simple domain state to the multi-domain state of the\ncylindrical pore occurs. We predict that the difference between the pore\ncritical temperature and the hysteresis critical emperature should increase\nlogarithmically with the length of the pore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 12:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We introduce overall interfacial\nresistances and conductances as the coefficients in the force-flux relations\nfor the Gibbs surface. We derive relations between the local resistivities for\nthe continuous description inside the interfacial region and the overall\nresistances of the surface for transport between the two phases for a mixture.\nIt is shown that interfacial resistances depend among other things on the\nenthalpy profile across the interface.

Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the\nchoice of the stellar yields. We adopt a widely used model for the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellar\nnucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical\nspecies. We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis\nin stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the model\npredictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak\nelements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.\nThe main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models\nassuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations\nare: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova\nexplosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in\nmodels of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of\nrotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted\nrates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the different\ntreatments of convection. Our results suggest that it is mandatory to include\nprocesses such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation in\nstars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution and\nnucleosynthesis. In spite of their importance, both these processes still have\nto be better understood and characterized. As for massive stars, presupernova\nmodels computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature,\nbut they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results of\nexplosive nucleosynthesis computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We aim to\nconfirm the field detection and provide additional observational constraints\nabout the field characteristics, by modelling the magnetic geometry of the star\nand by investigating the seasonal variability of the reconstructed field. We\nanalyse a total of 799 circularly-polarized spectra collected with the NARVAL\nand ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeters during 2008 and 2009. We employ a\ncross-correlation procedure to compute, from each spectrum, a mean polarized\nline profile with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20,000. The technique of\nZeeman-Doppler Imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of the\nstar and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of Vega at two different\nepochs. We confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the mean\nline profiles. The amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines of\nhigher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for a\nsignal of magnetic origin. The short-term evolution of polarized signatures is\nconsistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \\pm 0.008 d. The reconstructed\nmagnetic topology unveils a magnetic region of radial field orientation,\nclosely concentrated around the rotation pole. This polar feature is\naccompanied by a small number of magnetic patches at lower latitudes. No\nsignificant variability in the field structure is observed over a time span of\none year.

The converse is based on a\nSato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is\nbased on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.\n  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be\nattained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the\ngeneralized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the\nresulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of\nthe corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind\n\"masked\" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends\ninformation along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,\nand synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily\nfar from capacity in this regime.\n  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are\nprovided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the\nchannel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting\nscaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper\nneeds 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have\njointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and\nintended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

This\none-parameter behavior allows SNe Ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standard\ncandles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating Universe. Recent\ninvestigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of SNe Ia is more\ncomplicated. Theoretically, it has been suggested that the initial\nthermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of the\nwhite-dwarf (WD) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before the\nexplosion. Observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of SNe\nIa beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. Here we\nreport that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions from\nwhich an asymmetric explosion is viewed. Our findings suggest that the spectral\nevolution diversity is no longer a concern in using SNe Ia as cosmological\nstandard candles. Furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset from\nthe centre of is a generic feature of SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These are compared with\n\"standard\" NNLO distributions, generated at some fixed and higher resolution\nscale (Q_0^2>1 GeV^2). The NNLO corrections imply in both approaches an\nimproved value of \\chi^2, typically \\chi^2_{NNLO} \\sim 0.9\\chi^2_{NLO}. The\ndynamical NNLO uncertainties are somewhat smaller than the NLO ones and both\nare, as expected, smaller than those of their \"standard\" counterparts. The\ndynamical predictions for F_L(x,Q^2) become perturbatively stable already at\nQ^2 = 2 - 3 GeV^2, where precision measurements could even delineate NNLO\neffects in the very small-x region. Using these NNLO dynamical parton\ndistributions in the FFNS as input, we generate radiatively parton\ndistributions in the \"variable flavor number factorization scheme\" (VFNS) as\nwell, where also the heavy quark flavors (c,b,t) become massless partons within\nthe nucleon. Only within the VFNS are NNLO calculations feasible at present,\nsince the required partonic subprocesses are available only in the\napproximation of massless initial-state partons. The NNLO predictions for gauge\nboson production are typically larger (by more than 1 sigma) than the NLO ones,\nand rates at LHC energies can be predicted with an accuracy of about 5%,\nwhereas at Tevatron they are more than 2 sigma above the NLO ones. The NNLO\npredictions for SM Higgs boson production via the dominant gluon fusion process\nhave a total (PDFs and scale) uncertainty of about 10% at LHC which almost\ndoubles at the lower Tevatron energies; these predictions are typically about\n20% larger than the ones at NLO but the total uncertainty bands overlap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}
