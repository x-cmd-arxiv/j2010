In\nparticular, we focus on the effects of finite image angular resolution, the\npresence of noise, and spatial filtering. We find that, even when the image has\nbeen so heavily degraded with added noise and lowered angular resolution that\nthe clumps it contains clearly no longer correspond to pre-stellar cores, still\nthe clump mass function is typically consistent with the stellar initial mass\nfunction within their mutual uncertainties. We explain this result by\nsuggesting that noise, source blending, and spatial filtering all randomly\nperturb the clump masses, biasing the mass function toward a lognormal form\nwhose high-mass end mimics a Salpeter power law. We argue that this is a\nconsequence of the central limit theorem and that it strongly limits our\nability to accurately measure the true mass function of the clumps. We support\nthis conclusion by showing that the characteristic mass scale of the clump mass\nfunction, represented by the ``break mass'', scales as a simple function of the\nangular resolution of the image from which the clump mass function is derived.\nThis strongly constrains our ability to use the clump mass function to derive a\nstar formation efficiency.

Despite the simplicity with which the problem can be\nstated, the solution involves complex statistical issues that require careful\nanalysis. In contrast to the confidence bound, this concept has never been\nformally analyzed, leading to a great variety of often ad hoc solutions. Here\nwe formulate and describe the problem in a self-consistent manner. Detection\nsignificance is usually defined by the acceptable proportion of false positives\n(the TypeI error), and we invoke the complementary concept of false negatives\n(the TypeII error), based on the statistical power of a test, to compute an\nupper limit to the detectable source intensity. To determine the minimum\nintensity that a source must have for it to be detected, we first define a\ndetection threshold, and then compute the probabilities of detecting sources of\nvarious intensities at the given threshold. The intensity that corresponds to\nthe specified TypeII error probability defines that minimum intensity, and is\nidentified as the upper limit. Thus, an upper limit is a characteristic of the\ndetection procedure rather than the strength of any particular source and\nshould not be confused with confidence intervals or other estimates of source\nintensity. This is particularly important given the large number of catalogs\nthat are being generated from increasingly sensitive surveys. We discuss the\ndifferences between these upper limits and confidence bounds. Both measures are\nuseful quantities that should be reported in order to extract the most science\nfrom catalogs, though they answer different statistical questions: an upper\nbound describes an inference range on the source intensity, while an upper\nlimit calibrates the detection process.

The\nevaporitic sediments could have formed by saline saturation of the water\nenclosed in the limited cavities of liquid water located at the bottom of the\nocean.

There are many\nstochastic search problems whose behavior depends on an exogenous state\nvariable which affects the shape of the objective function. Currently, there is\nno general purpose algorithm to solve this class of problems. We use\nnonparametric density estimation to take observations from the joint\nstate-outcome distribution and use them to infer the optimal decision for a\ngiven query state. We propose two solution methods that depend on the problem\ncharacteristics: function-based and gradient-based optimization. We examine two\nweighting schemes, kernel-based weights and Dirichlet process-based weights,\nfor use with the solution methods. The weights and solution methods are tested\non a synthetic multi-product newsvendor problem and the hour-ahead wind\ncommitment problem.

First, we use\nstatistical correlation and regression analysis and show that the relationships\nare not monotonic for total solar irradiance and for continuum radiation from\nthe photosphere, but are approximately linear for chromospheric and coronal\nradiation. Second, we use signal theory to examine the flux-flux relationships\nfor a temporal component. We find that a well-defined temporal component exists\nand accounts for some of the variance in the data. This temporal component\narises because active regions with high magnetic field strength evolve,\nbreaking up into small-scale magnetic elements with low field strength, and\nradiative and magnetic fluxes are sensitive to different active-region\ncomponents.

The framework assumes perfect CSI\nat the transmitter and receiver. This simple linear processing scheme can\nprovide a doubly exponential probability of error decay with blocklength for\nall rates less than capacity. Remarkably, this encoding scheme actually\nconsists of two separate encoding blocks: one that adapts to the current CSI\nand one that adapts to the previous channel output feedback.

The system shows three\npairs of collinear cavities at 1 kpc, 8 kpc, and 20 kpc from the central\nsource, from three distinct outbursts of the central AGN, which occurred\n3x10^6, 2x10^7, and 9x10^7 yr ago. The H-alpha and X-ray observations reveal\nfilaments of cool gas that has been uplifted by the X-ray cavities. The inner\ntwo cavity pairs are filled with radio emitting plasma, and each pair is\nassociated with an elliptical surface brightness edge, which we unambiguously\nidentify as shocks (with measured temperature jumps) with Mach numbers of M~1.7\nand M~1.5 for the inner and outer shocks, respectively. Such clear signatures\nfrom three distinct AGN outbursts in an otherwise dynamically relaxed system\nprovide a unique opportunity to study AGN feedback and outburst history. The\nmean power of the two most recent outbursts differs by a factor of six, from\n1.5--10x10^42 erg/s, indicating that the mean jet power changes significantly\nover long (~10^7 yr) timescales.

However, by exploiting a mapping between\nthe partition function for this model and probabilistic classical circuits we\nare able to show that it is possible to make this model effectively error free.\nWe achieve this by using techniques in fault-tolerant classical computing and\nthe result is that the system can compute effectively error free if the\ntemperature is below a critical temperature.

This scenario, however, has two long-standing problems. First, the\nexplosions do not naturally produce the correct mix of elements, but have to be\nfinely tuned to proceed from sub-sonic deflagration to super-sonic detonation.\nSecond, population models and observations give formation rates of\nnear-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs that are far too small. Here, we suggest that\ntype Ia supernovae instead result from mergers of roughly equal-mass\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarfs, including those that produce sub-Chandrasekhar mass\nremnants. Numerical studies of such mergers have shown that the remnants\nconsist of rapidly rotating cores that contain most of the mass and are hottest\nin the center, surrounded by dense, small disks. We argue that the disks\naccrete quickly, and that the resulting compressional heating likely leads to\ncentral carbon ignition. This ignition occurs at densities for which pure\ndetonations lead to events similar to type Ia supernovae. With this merger\nscenario, we can understand the type Ia rates, and have plausible reasons for\nthe observed range in luminosity and for the bias of more luminous supernovae\ntowards younger populations. We speculate that explosions of white dwarfs\nslowly brought to the Chandrasekhar limit---which should also occur---are\nresponsible for some of the \"atypical\" type Ia supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 22:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 18:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2010 01:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The reconnection creates flux tubes of new connectivity which\nsubsequently retract at Alfv\\'enic speeds from the reconnection site. Heating\noccurs in gas-dynamic shocks which develop inside these tubes. Here we present\ngeneralized thin flux tube equations for the dynamics of reconnected flux\ntubes, including pressure-driven parallel dynamics as well as temperature\ndependent, anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity. The evolution of\ntubes embedded in a uniform, skewed magnetic field, following reconnection in a\npatch, is studied through numerical solutions of these equations, for solar\ncoronal conditions. Even though viscosity and thermal conductivity are\nnegligible in the quiet solar corona, the strong gas-dynamic shocks generated\nby compressing plasma inside reconnected flux tubes generate large velocity and\ntemperature gradients along the tube, rendering the diffusive processes\ndominant. They determine the thickness of the shock that evolves up to a\nsteady-state value, although this condition may not be reached in the short\ntimes involved in a flare. For realistic solar coronal parameters, this\nsteady-state shock thickness might be as long as the entire flux tube. For\nstrong shocks at low Prandtl numbers, typical of the solar corona, the\ngas-dynamic shock consists of an isothermal sub-shock where all the compression\nand cooling occur, preceded by a thermal front where the temperature increases\nand most of the heating occurs.

The\nresearch over the last decade on adaptive OFDMA systems has focused on adapting\nthe allocation of radio resources, such as subcarriers and power, to the\ninstantaneous channel conditions of all users. However, such \"fast\" adaptation\nrequires high computational complexity and excessive signaling overhead. This\nhinders the deployment of adaptive OFDMA systems worldwide. This paper proposes\na slow adaptive OFDMA scheme, in which the subcarrier allocation is updated on\na much slower timescale than that of the fluctuation of instantaneous channel\nconditions. Meanwhile, the data rate requirements of individual users are\naccommodated on the fast timescale with high probability, thereby meeting the\nrequirements except occasional outage. Such an objective has a natural chance\nconstrained programming formulation, which is known to be intractable. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we formulate safe tractable constraints for the\nproblem based on recent advances in chance constrained programming. We then\ndevelop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the\nreformulated problem. Our results show that the proposed slow adaptation scheme\ndrastically reduces both computational cost and control signaling overhead when\ncompared with the conventional fast adaptive OFDMA. Our work can be viewed as\nan initial attempt to apply the chance constrained programming methodology to\nwireless system designs. Given that most wireless systems can tolerate an\noccasional dip in the quality of service, we hope that the proposed methodology\nwill find further applications in wireless communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 02:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The SMC extinction curve has been shown to reproduce the dust reddening\nof most quasars at z<2.2; we investigate whether this curve also provides a\ngood description of dust extinction at higher redshifts. We fit the observed\nspectra with synthetic absorbed quasar templates obtained by varying the\nintrinsic slope (alpha), the absolute extinction (A3000), and by using a grid\nof empirical and theoretical extinction curves. We find that seven quasars in\nour sample are affected by substantial extinction (A3000 >0.8), and\ncharacterized by very steep intrinsic slopes (alpha<-2.3). All of the\nindividual quasars require extinction curve deviating from that of the SMC,\nwith a tendency to flatten at lambda<2000 A (in the rest frame of the source).\nWe obtain a mean extinction curve at z>4, both by performing a simultaneous fit\nof all quasars and by averaging the extinction curves inferred for individual\nquasars. In the case of broad absorption line quasars the mean extinction curve\ndeviates from the SMC at a confidence level >95%. The difference between\nextinction curves in quasars at z>4 and in quasars at lower redshift is\nindicative of either a different dust production mechanism at high redshift, or\na different mechanism for processing dust into the ISM. We suggest that the\nsame transitions may also apply to normal, star-forming galaxies at z>4. In\nparticular, the observed change in the average spectral slope of galaxies at\nz>4 may be partially ascribed to a variation in the extinction curve, rather\nthan a lower dust content at high redshift. In this scenario, the extinction\ncurve inferred at z>4 would imply a cosmic star-formation corrected for dust\nattenuation a factor of ~2 higher than estimated in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 10:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 18:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, it has been shown on statistical\ngrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification\nscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far\nnot been done. The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift\nera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this third\npopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and their\nafterglows. Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during\nits first four years of operation. The sample contains those bursts with\nmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.\nIntermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long\nGRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average\none order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. There is a less significant\ntrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than\nlong bursts. Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to\nlong bursts. In particular, they follow the Epeak vs. Eiso correlation and\nhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that of\nlong bursts. Like long GRBs, they normally have an associated supernova,\nalthough some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. This study\nshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite of\nsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences between\nthem as well. We suggest that the physical difference between intermediate and\nlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while for\nthe latter they are thick shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 10:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 14:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-30"}

In the double detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) a\ndetonation initiates in a shell of He-rich material accreted from a companion\nstar by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf (WD). This shell detonation drives\na shock front into the carbon-oxygen (C/O) WD that triggers a secondary\ndetonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of\nthe WD. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in\naccounting for the observed properties of SNe Ia since the explosion ejecta are\nsurrounded by the products of explosive He burning in the shell. Recently, it\nwas proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive He shells\nthan previously assumed. Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these\nminimum He shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the C/O core. Here we\npresent time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for\nmodels with minimum He shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the\noptical and {\\gamma}-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those\nfound in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more\nmassive He shells were considered. Our models predict light curves which cover\nboth the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed SNe\nIa. However, their colours and spectra do not match the observations. In\nparticular, their B-V colours are generally too red. We show that this\ndiscrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the He\nshell of our models which contain significant amounts of Ti and Cr. Using a toy\nmodel, we also show that the burning products of the He shell depend crucially\non its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement\nbetween sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed SNe Ia may still be\nfeasible but further study of the shell properties is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 11:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-18"}

In addition, considering that the nodes of ad hoc networks are mobile,\nit is possible that a created path is broken because of nodes mobility and\nestablishment of a new path would be done again. This is because of sending\nadditional control packets, accordingly, energy consumption increases. Also, it\nshould avoid nodes which have more buffered packets.

Hydrogen ionized by young, high-mass stars in starburst galaxies\nradiates radio recombination lines (RRLs), whose strength can be used as a\ndiagnostic of the ionization rate, conditions and gas dynamics in the\nstarburst, without problems of dust obscuration. However, the lines are weak\nand only few extragalactic starburst systems have been detected.\n  Aims. We aimed to increase the number of known starburst systems with\ndetectable RRLs for detailed studies.\n  Methods. We searched for the RRLs H91alpha and H92alpha at 8 GHz in the\nnearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4945 using the ATCA with resolution of 3\". This\nyielded a detection from which we derived conditions in the starburst.\n  Results. We detected RRLs from the nucleus of NGC 4945 with a peak strength\nof 17.8 mJy, making it the strongest extragalactic RRL emitter known at this\nfrequency. The line emission from NGC 4945 can be matched by a model consisting\nof a collection of 10 to 300 H II regions with temperatures of 5000 K,\ndensities of 10^3 cm^-3 to 10^4 cm^-3 and a total effective diameter of 2 pc to\n100 pc. The Lyman continuum production rate required to maintain the ionization\nrequires 2000 to 10000 O5 stars to be produced in the starburst, inferring a\nstar formation rate of 2 Msun/yr to 8 Msun/yr. We resolved the rotation curve\nwithin the central 70 pc region and this is well described by a set of rotating\nrings that were coplanar and edge on with a simple flat rotation curve. The\nrotation speed of 120 km/s within the central 1\" (19 pc) radius infers an\nenclosed mass of 3 x 10^7 Msun.\n  Conclusion. We discovered RRLs from NGC 4945. It is the strongest known\nextragalactic RRL emitter and is suited to high-quality spectroscopic study. We\nresolved the dynamics of the ionized gas in the central 70 pc and derived\nconditions and star formation rates in the ionized gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 15:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-24"}

The range of pattern speed is covered exhaustively. We find that not all\npattern speeds are allowed when the inner bar rotates in the same direction as\nthe outer bar. Below a certain minimum pattern speed orbital support for the\ninner bar abruptly disappears, while at high values of this speed the orbits\nindicate an increasingly round bar that looks more like a twist in the nuclear\nisophotes than a dynamically independent component. For values between these\ntwo extremes, orbits supporting the inner bar extend further out as the bar's\npattern speed decreases, their corresponding loops become more eccentric,\npulsate more, and their rotation becomes increasingly non-uniform, as they\nspeed up and slow down in their motion. Lower pattern speeds also lead to a\nless coherent bar, as the pulsation and acceleration increasingly varies among\nthe loops supporting the inner bar. The morphologies of fast and slow inner\nbars expected from the orbital structure studied here are recently recovered\nobservationally by decomposition of double barred galaxies.

This allows to identify\nthe characteristic structures in the bulk of a growing aggregate (\"clusters\"\nand \"crevices\") with minimizers and shocks in the Burgers turbulence, and to\nintroduce a new kind of equipped Airy process for ballistic growth. We dub it\nthe \"hairy Airy process\" and investigate its statistics numerically. We also\nidentify scaling laws that characterize the ballistic deposition patterns in\nthe bulk: the law of \"thinning\" of the forest of clusters with increasing\nheight, the law of transversal fluctuations of cluster boundaries, and the size\ndistribution of clusters. The corresponding critical exponents are determined\nexactly based on the analogy with the Burgers turbulence and simple scaling\nconsiderations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 15:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 11:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-09"}
