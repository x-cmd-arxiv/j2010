Compared to GaAs quantum dots,\nthe spectrum exhibits a much richer structure because of the spin-orbit\ninteraction that couples the electron's isospin to its real spin through two\nindependent coupling constants. In a single dot, both constants combine to\nsplit the spectrum into two Kramers doublets, while the antisymmetric constant\nsolely controls the difference in the tunneling rates of the Kramers doublets\nbetween the dots. For the two-electron regime, the detailed structure of the\nspin-orbit split energy spectrum is investigated as a function of detuning\nbetween the quantum dots in a 22-dimensional Hilbert space within the framework\nof a single-longitudinal-mode model. We find a competing effect of the\ntunneling and Coulomb interaction. The former favors a left-right symmetric\ntwo-particle ground state, while in the regime where the Coulomb interaction\ndominates over tunneling, a left-right antisymmetric ground state is found. As\na result, ground states on both sides of the $(11)$-$(02)$ degeneracy point may\npossess opposite left-right symmetry, and the electron dynamics when tuning the\nsystem from one side of the $(11)$-$(02)$ degeneracy point to the other is\ncontrolled by three selection rules (in spin, isospin, and left-right\nsymmetry).

The dynamics of the binary is\nevolved by taking into account the erosion of the central stellar cusp bound to\nthe massive black holes, the scattering of unbound stars feeding the binary\nloss cone, and the emission of gravitational waves (GWs). Stellar dynamics is\ntreated in a hybrid fashion by coupling the results of numerical 3-body\nscattering experiments of bound and unbound stars to an analytical framework\nfor the evolution of the stellar density distribution and for the efficiency of\nthe binary loss cone refilling. Our main focus is on the behaviour of the\nbinary eccentricity, in the attempt of addressing its importance in the merger\nprocess and its possible impact for GW detection with the planned Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna ({\\it LISA}), and ongoing and forthcoming pulsar\ntiming array (PTA) campaigns.

The main theme of our paper\nis to identify several of these problems, among them a couple of widely studied\nextremal functions related to certain restricted versions of the k-SAT problem,\nwhere the Local Lemma does give essentially optimal answers.\n  As our main contribution, we construct unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas where\nevery clause has k distinct literals and every variable appears in at most (2/e\n+ o(1))*2^k/k clauses. The Lopsided Local Lemma shows that this is\nasymptotically best possible. The determination of this extremal function is\nparticularly important as it represents the value where the corresponding k-SAT\nproblem exhibits a complexity hardness jump: from having every instance being a\nYES-instance it becomes NP-hard just by allowing each variable to occur in one\nmore clause.\n  The construction of our unsatisfiable CNF-formulas is based on the binary\ntree approach of [16] and thus the constructed formulas are in the class MU(1)\nof minimal unsatisfiable formulas having one more clauses than variables. The\nmain novelty of our approach here comes in setting up an appropriate continuous\napproximation of the problem. This leads us to a differential equation, the\nsolution of which we are able to estimate. The asymptotically optimal binary\ntrees are then obtained through a discretization of this solution.\n  The importance of the binary trees constructed is also underlined by their\nappearance in many other scenarios.

The numerical solutions show that, under certain conditions, a\nspacecraft can take on a negative potential in spite of strong photoelectron\ncurrents. The negative potential is due to an electrostatic barrier near the\nsurface of the spacecraft that can reflect a large fraction of the\nphotoelectron flux back to the spacecraft. This electrostatic barrier forms if\n(1) the photoelectron density at the surface of the spacecraft greatly exceeds\nthe ambient plasma density, (2) the spacecraft size is significantly larger\nthan local Debye length of the photoelectrons, and (3) the thermal electron\nenergy is much larger than the characteristic energy of the escaping\nphotoelectrons. All of these conditions are present near the Sun. The numerical\nsolutions also show that the spacecraft's negative potential can be amplified\nby an ion wake. The negative potential of the ion wake prevents secondary\nelectrons from escaping the part of spacecraft in contact with the wake. These\nfindings may be important for future spacecraft missions that go nearer to the\nSun, such as Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 00:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

To this\nend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to the\nstudy of the high-z GRB 090205. We carried out optical/NIR spectroscopy and\nimaging of GRB 090205 with the ESO-VLT starting from hours after the event up\nto several days later to detect the host galaxy. We compared the results\nobtained from our optical/NIR observations with the available Swift high-energy\ndata of this burst. Our observational campaign led to the detection of the\noptical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 090205 and to the first measure of its\nredshift, z=4.65. Similar to other, recent high-z GRBs, GRB 090205 has a short\nduration in the rest-frame with T_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibility\nthat it might belong to the short GRBs class. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 090205\nshows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at\n500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. Photometric\nobservations of the GRB 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxy\nwith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 Myr. Moreover, the metallicity of\nZ > 0.27 Z_Sun derived from the GRB afterglow spectrum is among the highest\nderived from GRB afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burst\noccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. Finally, a detailed analysis of the\nafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to Lyman-alpha\nemission at the redshift of the burst. GRB 090205 is thus hosted in a typical\nLyman-alpha emitter (LAE) at z=4.65. This makes the GRB 090205 host the\nfarthest GRB host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 08:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Both values nicely fit in the recycling scenario and I infer the\nexistence of a magnetic field for the pulsar of B~2x10^{8} G. No evidence for\nan enhanced spin down due to gravitational wave emission is found. The\naccretion torques are smaller than previously reported and there is strong\nevidence for an ordered process that is present in all outbursts that might be\nconnected with a motion of the hot spot on the neutron star surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 09:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 13:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Methods:\nDetected molecular and atomic lines are interpreted by means of emission line\ndiagnostics and an existing grid of molecular shock models. The physical\nproperties of the warm gas are compared against other molecular jet tracers and\nto the results of a similar study towards the L1448-C outflow. Results: We have\ndetected and mapped the v=0-0 S(0) - S(7) H2 lines and fine-structure lines of\nS, Fe+, and Si+. H2 is detected down to 5\" from the source and is characterized\nby a \"cool\" T~300K and a \"warm\" T~1000 K component, with an extinction Av ~ 8\nmag. The amount of cool H2 towards the jet agrees with that estimated from CO\nassuming fully molecular gas. The warm component is well fitted by C-type\nshocks with a low beam filling factor ~ 0.01-0.04 and a mass-flux similar to\nthe cool H2. The fine-structure line emission arises from dense gas with\nionization fraction ~0.5 - 5 x 10e-3, suggestive of dissociative shocks. Line\nratios to sulfur indicate that iron and silicon are depleted compared to solar\nabundances by a factor ~10-50. Conclusions: Spitzer spectral mapping\nobservations reveal for the first time a cool H$_2$ component towards the CO\njet of HH211 consistent with the CO material being fully molecular and warm at\n~ 300 K. The maps also reveal for the first time the existence of an embedded\natomic jet in the HH211 outflow that can be traced down to the central source\nposition. Its significant iron and silicon depletion excludes an origin from\nwithin the dust sublimation zone around the protostar. The momentum-flux seems\ninsufficient to entrain the CO jet, although current uncertainties on jet speed\nand shock conditions are too large for a definite conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 09:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

To address this problem, in this paper a\nVertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) MIMO enhanced with\nRate-Compatible Convolutional (RCPC) codes with Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum\nMean Squared Error (MMSE)-based detection is proposed. The analytical BER of\nthe system is presented and numerically analyzed. The system performance is\nanalyzed in Nakagami-m fading channel, which provides accuracy and flexibility\nin matching the signals statistics compared to other fading models. The\ncomplexity which arises in the calculations of the RCPC codes parameters is\nsignificantly reduced by using equivalent convolutional codes. Results show\nthat the use of high-rate code allows for bandwidth efficiency and at the same\ntime does not severely degrades the system performance. It is also shown that\nthe MMSE-based system outperforms the conventional ZF-based system especially\nin the low Eb/N0 region and in severe fading conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 10:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-07"}

The\nobservations performed for this dissertation represent the first endeavour to\nobtain full 2D coverage of the disks of a sample of nearby spiral galaxies, by\nthe application of the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) technique, under the\nPPAK IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey: PINGS. A self-consistent methodology is\ndefined in terms of observation, data reduction and analysis techniques for\nthis and upcoming IFS surveys, as well as providing a whole new set of IFS\nvisualization and analysis software made available for the public domain\n(PINGSoft). The scientific analysis comprises the study of the integrated\nproperties of the ionized gas and a detailed 2D study from the emission line\nspectra of four selected galaxies. Evidence is found suggesting that\nmeasurements of emission lines of classical HII regions are not only aperture,\nbut spatial dependent, and therefore, the derived physical parameters and\nmetallicity content may significantly depend on the morphology of the region,\non the extraction aperture and on the signal-to-noise of the observed spectrum.\nFurthermore, observational evidence of non-linear multi-modal abundance\ngradients in normal spiral galaxies is found, consistent with a flattening in\nthe innermost and outermost parts of the galactic discs, with important\nimplications in terms of the chemical evolution of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 10:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-07"}

This can be achieved by\nbundling the resources in a known and prescribed fashion called Learning\nobjects. Learning Objects are composed of two aspects namely \"Learning\" and\n\"Object\". The Learning aspect of Learning objects refers to Education. Since\nEducation is a process so the primary aim of learning objects tends to be\nfacilitating acquisition, assessment and conversion of content into Learning\nobjects while fostering the assimilation of these Learning objects into\nlearning modules and instruction. The Object part of Learning objects relates\nto the Digital Electronic format of the resources i.e. to say that it deals\nwith the physical resource that forms the Learning objects. The objects in LOs\nare analogous to objects used in object-oriented modeling (OOM). The analogy\nhelps visualize how LOs will be packaged, processed and transported across the\ndigital library as well as utilized in course building. OOM concepts such as\nencapsulation, classification, polymorphism, inheritance and reuse can be\nborrowed to describe the operations on LOs in the digital library. Thus, the\naim of this paper is threefolds. Firstly, to discuss the background of this\nresearch and the concept of Learning Objects. Secondly, to provide a framework\nfor adaptive mechanism for the retrieval of Learning Objects and thirdly to\nhighlight the benefits that this new proposed framework shall bring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 11:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

In the known applications where Hall-effect sensors and magnets\n(radially positioned) are applied, the purpose of the latter is to help\ndeveloping a binary code used mainly for filter identification. The number of\nsensors is equal to the maximum number of magnets that participate in forming\nthe filter identity code. Therefore, three sensors and the corresponding number\nof magnets radially positioned for each position are required for the\nidentification of seven filters. The precise position of the filter disk is\nreached by counting up the steps of a stepper motor. The presented approach\napplies only one Hall-effect sensor. The fore working front of one magnet,\npositioned along the disk periphery, is used to precisely mark each filter\nposition. At a certain distance after the main magnet, a second one is\npositioned in order to form an identity code.

Transitions of the C17O and\nC18O observed with the IRAM 30m telescope and JCMT are used to study the mass\nand velocity structure of the region while the physical properties of the gas\nare derived using LTE and non-LTE analyses of the three lowest transitions of\nC18O. The molecular emission traces the two centres of star formation which are\nseen in submillimetre dust continuum emission. In the ~40M_sun NW sub-cluster\nthe gas and dust emission trace the same structures although there is evidence\nof some depletion of the gas phase C18O. The gas has a very uniform temperature\n(~10K) and velocity (~8.5km/s) throughout the region. This is in marked\ncontrast to the SE sub-cluster. In this region the dust and the gas trace\ndifferent features, with the temperature peaking between the submillimetre\ncontinuum sources, reaching up to ~14K. The gas in this region has double\npeaked line profiles which reveal the presence of a second cloud in the line of\nsight. The submillimetre dust continuum sources predominantly appear located in\nthe interface region between the two clouds. Even though they are at a similar\nstage of evolution, the two Serpens sub-clusters have very different\ncharacteristics. We propose that these differences are linked to the initial\ntrigger of the collapse in the regions and suggest that a cloud-cloud collision\ncould explain the observed properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 12:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The spatial\ndisorder of the complex geometry of fault networks is then taken into account\nby defining faults as probabilistic anisotropic kernels, whose structures are\nmotivated by properties of discontinuous tectonic deformation and previous\nempirical observations of the geometry of faults and of earthquake clusters at\nmany spatial and temporal scales.

The symmetry axes of the\ntwo sources are aligned to within 5 degrees in the plane of the sky and the\ntips of their bow-shocks point towards Sgr A*. Our measurements show that the\nproper motion vectors of both features are pointing in directions more than 45\ndeg away from the line that connects them with Sgr A*. This misalignment of the\nbow-shock symmetry axes and their proper motion vectors, combined with the high\nproper motion velocities of several 100 km/s, suggest that the bow-shocks must\nbe produced by an interaction with some external fast wind, possibly coming\nfrom Sgr A*, or stars in its vicinity. We have developed a bow-shock model to\nfit the observed morphology and constrain the source of the external wind. The\nresult of our modeling allows us to estimate the velocity of the external wind,\nmaking sure that all likely stellar types of the bow-shock stars are\nconsidered. We show that neither of the two bow-shocks (one of which is clearly\nassociated with a stellar source) can be produced by influence of a stellar\nwind of a single mass-losing star in the central parsec. Instead, an outflow\ncarrying a momentum comparable to the one contributed by the ensemble of the\nmassive young stars, can drive shock velocities capable of producing the\nobserved cometary features. We argue that a collimated outflow arising\nperpendicular to the plane of the clockwise rotating stars (CWS), can easily\naccount for the two features and the mini-cavity. However, the collective wind\nfrom the CWS has a scale of >10''. The presence of a strong, mass-loaded\noutbound wind at projected distances from Sgr A* of <1'' is in fact in\nagreement with models that predict a highly inefficient accretion onto the\ncentral black hole due to a strongly radius dependent accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 14:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

One example is the effect of a local\nunder-density on supernova cosmology. Also known as a Hubble-bubble, it has\nbeen suggested that a large enough under-density could account for the\nsupernova magnitude- redshift relation without the need for dark energy or\nacceleration. Although the size and depth of under-density required for such an\nextreme result is extremely unlikely to be a random fluctuation in an\non-average homogeneous universe, even a small under-density can leave residual\neffects on our cosmological inferences.\n  In this paper we show that there remain systematic shifts in our cosmological\nparameter measure- ments, even after excluding local supernovae that are likely\nto be within any small Hubble-bubble. We study theoretically the low-redshift\ncutoff typically imposed by supernova cosmology analyses, and show that a\nlow-redshift cut of z0 \\sim 0.02 may be too low based on the observed\ninhomogeneity in our local universe.\n  Neglecting to impose any low-redshift cutoff can have a significant effect on\nthe cosmological pa- rameters derived from supernova data. A slight local\nunder-density, just 30% under-dense with scale 70h^{-1} Mpc, causes an error in\nthe inferred cosmological constant density {\\Omega}{\\Lambda} of \\sim 4%.\nImposing a low-redshift cutoff reduces this systematic error but does not\nremove it entirely. A residual systematic shift of 0.99% remains in the\ninferred value {\\Omega}{\\Lambda} even when neglecting all data within the\ncurrently pre- ferred low-redshift cutoff of 0.02. Given current measurement\nuncertainties this shift is not negligible, and will need to be accounted for\nwhen future measurements yield higher precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 14:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In such superfluids there may also exist other excitations below\nthe bulk gap inside the cores of vortices. We study the properties of these\nsubgap states, and argue that their presence affects the topological protection\nof the zero modes. In conventional superconductors where the chemical potential\nis of the order of the Fermi energy of a non-interacting Fermi gas, there is a\nlarge number of subgap states and the mini-gap towards the lowest of these\nstates is a small fraction of the Fermi energy. It is therefore difficult to\ncool the system to below the mini-gap and at experimentally available\ntemperatures, transitions between the subgap states, including the zero modes,\nwill occur and can alter the quantum states of the zero-modes. We show that\ncompound qubits involving the zero-modes and the parity of the occupation\nnumber of the subgap states on each vortex are still well defined. However,\npractical schemes taking into account all subgap states would nonetheless be\ndifficult to achieve. We propose to avoid this difficulty by working in the\nregime of small chemical potential mu, near the transition to a strongly paired\nphase, where the number of subgap states is reduced. We develop the theory to\ndescribe this regime of strong pairing interactions and we show how the subgap\nstates are ultimately absorbed into the bulk gap. Since the bulk gap vanishes\nas mu -> 0 there is an optimum value mu_c which maximises the combined gap. We\npropose cold atomic gases as candidate systems where the regime of strong\ninteractions can be explored, and explicitly evaluate mu_c in a Feshbach\nresonant K-40 gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 15:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2011 13:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-14"}
