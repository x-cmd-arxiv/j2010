We used\nthe 10' x 10' Minimosaic Imager to observe the galaxies in BVR filters to\nprojected radii of ~20 kpc from the galaxy centers. We combined the WIYN data\nwith archival and published data from WFPC2 and ACS on the Hubble Space\nTelescope to assess the contamination level of the WIYN GC candidate sample and\nto follow the GC systems further in toward the galaxies' centers. We\nconstructed radial distributions for the GC systems using both the WIYN and HST\ndata. The GC systems of NGC891 and NGC4013 extend to 9+/-3 kpc and 14+/-5 kpc,\nrespectively, before falling off to undetectable levels in our images. We use\nthe radial distributions to calculate global values for the total number (N_GC)\nand specific frequencies (S_N and T) of GCs. NGC4013 has N_GC = 140+/-20, S_N =\n1.0+/-0.2 and T = 1.9+/-0.5; our N_GC value is ~40% smaller than a previous\ndetermination from the literature. The HST data were especially useful for\nNGC891, because the GC system is concentrated toward the plane of the galaxy\nand was only weakly detected in our WIYN images. Although NGC891 is thought to\nresemble the Milky Way in its overall properties, it has only half as many GCs,\nwith N_GC = 70+/-20, S_N = 0.3+/-0.1 and T = 0.6+/-0.3. We also calculate the\ngalaxy-mass-normalized number of blue (metal-poor) GCs in NGC891 and NGC4013\nand find that they fall along a general trend of increasing specific frequency\nof blue GCs with increasing galaxy mass. Given currently available resources,\nthe optimal method for studying the global properties of extragalactic GC\nsystems is to combine HST data with wide-field, ground-based imaging with good\nresolution. The results here demonstrate the advantage gained by using both\nmethods when possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 16:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The jet was successfully\ndetected in both molecular and atomic lines. The H_2 component was found to be\nentirely blueshifted around the base of the bipolar jet. It shows that only the\nblue lobe is emitting in H_2 while light is scattered in the direction of the\nred lobe, highlighting an asymmetric extinction and/or excitation between the\ntwo lobes. Consistent with this view, the red lobe is brighter in all atomic\nlines. Interestingly, the jet was detected not only in [Fe II], but also in Br\ngamma and Pa beta lines. Though considered tracers mainly of accretion, we find\nthat these high excitation hydrogen permitted lines trace the jet as far as 150\nAU from the star.

Here, the theory of electronic Raman\nscattering in a superconductor by Klein and Dierker (1984) is extended to a\nmultiband superconductor. Raman scattering creates particle/hole pairs. In the\nrelevant $A_{1g}$\\ symmetry, the attraction that produces pairing necessarily\ncouples excitations of superconducting pairs to these p/h excitations. In the\nAppendix it is shown that for zero wave vector transfer $% q$ this coupling\nmodifies the Raman response and makes the long-range Coulomb correction null.\nThe 2-band result is applied to MgB$_{2}$ where this coupling activates\nLeggett's collective mode. His simple limiting case is obtained when the\ninterband attractive potential is decreased to a value well below that given by\nLDA theory. The peak from Leggett's mode is studied as the potential is\nincreased through the theoretical value: With realistic MgB$_{2}$\\ parameters,\nthe peak broadens through decay into the continuum above the smaller ($\\pi $\nband) superconducting gap. Finite $q$ effects are also taken into account,\nyielding a Raman peak that agrees well in energy with the experimental result\nby Blumberg \\textit{et el.} (2007). This approach is also applied to the $q=0$,\n2-band model of the Fe-pnictides considered by Chubukov \\textit{et al.}(2009).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 16:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-08"}

This allows a self-consistent estimation of the RPS\nexperienced by satellite galaxies. We find that the ram pressure (RP) in the\ncentral regions of clusters increases approximately one order of magnitude\nbetween z = 1 and 0, consistent with the increase in the density of the ICM.\nThe mean RP experienced by galaxies within the virial radius increases with\ndecreasing redshift.

Unlike the mean specific star\nformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surface\ndensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across the\nsample with a value close to SFE = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gas\nconsumption timescale of ~3 Gyr). Specifically, we find little variation in SFE\nwith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, NUV-r color and concentration.\nWe interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedback\nmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating star\nformation in massive galaxies. An investigation into the detailed distribution\nof SFEs reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencies\nwith SFE > 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to a\ndeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate.

We developed a new method to derive the intrinsic shape of bulges based\non the geometrical relationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of\nbulges and disks. The equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of bulges\nwere obtained from the length of the apparent major and minor semi-axes of the\nbulge, twist angle between the apparent major axis of the bulge and the galaxy\nline of nodes, and galaxy inclination. We found that the intrinsic shape is\nwell constrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. A\nlarge fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (B/A<0.9).\nThis fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or median\nequatorial ellipticity, respectively. Most are flattened along their polar axis\n(C<(A+B)/2). The distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. This\nbimodality is driven by bulges with Sersic index n>2, or equivalently, by the\nbulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio B/T>0.3. In particular, bulges\nwith n\\leq2 and with B/T\\leq0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric\n(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, and\nfewer prolate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect to\nbulges with n>2 and with B/T>0.3, respectively. According to predictions of the\nnumerical simulations of bulge formation, bulges with n\\leq2, which show a high\nfraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and have\nB/T\\leq0.3, could be the result of dissipational minor mergers. Both major\ndissipational and dissipationless mergers seem to be required to explain the\nvariety of shapes found for bulges with n>2 and B/T>0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

At\nslightly lower accretion rates AND in galaxies with dense galactic structure,\nsources with prominent jets result.

In this paper we\nshed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low mass galaxy by\npresenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of\nQ2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z=2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and\nunusual properties: BX418 is young (<100 Myr), low mass (M_star ~ 10^9 Msun),\nlow in metallicity (Z ~ 1/6 Zsun), and unreddened (E(B-V)~0.02, UV continuum\nslope beta=-2.1).

Students grapple with the existence\nof longitudinal modes in a laser cavity as they change the cavity length of an\nadjustable-cavity HeNe laser and tune the cavity to produce lasing in the\nTEM$_{00}$ mode. For appropriate laser cavity lengths, the laser gain curve of\na HeNe laser allows simultaneous operation of multiple longitudinal modes. The\ndifference frequency between the modes is measured using a self-heterodyne\ndetection with a diode photodetector and a radio frequency spectrum analyzer.\nAsymmetric effects due to frequency pushing and frequency pulling, as well as\ntransverse modes, are minimized by simultaneously monitoring and adjusting the\nmode structure as viewed with a Fabry-Perot interferometer. The frequency\nspacing of longitudinal modes is proportional to the inverse of the cavity\nlength with a proportionality constant equal to half the speed of light. By\nchanging the length of the cavity, without changing the path length within the\nHeNe gas, the speed of light in air can be measured to be ($2.9972 \\pm0.0002)\n\\times 10^{8}$ m/s, which is to high enough precision to distinguish between\nthe speed of light in air and that in a vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 20:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-30"}

With the discovery of many hot Jupiter\nplanets orbiting nearby stars, this motivates the development of robust methods\nof characterisation from follow up observations. In this paper we discuss two\nmethods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems. First, the\nmost widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot Jupiters\n(Collier Cameron et al.) is investigated for application for typical echelle\nspectra of a transiting planet system, showing that detection requires high\nsignal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets. Secondly a new Fourier analysis\nmethod is also presented, which is model-independent and utilises the benefits\nof the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems. This\napproach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in Fourier space\nby least-squares. The sensitivities of the methods are determined via Monte\nCarlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes. We find the Fourier\nanalysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observations\nof a well constrained transiting system than the Collier Cameron et al. method.\nWe apply the Fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered by\ntransiting hot Jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of HD\n209458 and HD 189733.

The\nSDSS spectra of in total 92 objects are analyzed by the same method used in our\nprevious studies, after requiring the signal-to-noise ratio in the SDSS r' band\nis larger than 20. Combing the ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies with the\ncomposite AGNs reinforces the tight correlation between the line ratio\n[OI]/H\\alpha vs. D_n(4000), and establishes a new tight correlation between\n[SII]/H\\alpha vs. D_n(4000). Both correlations suggest the two line ratios are\nplausible age indicators of the circumnuclear stellar population for typical\ntype I AGNs in which the stellar populations are difficult to be derived from\ntheir optical spectra. The ROSAT-selected Seyfert galaxies show that the two\ncorrelations depend on the soft X-ray spectral slope \\alpha_X that is roughly\nestimated from the hardness ratios by requiring the X-ray count rates within\n0.1-2.4 keV are larger than 0.02 counts s^-1.

In this paper, we first present\nplausible aftermaths of corporate espionage using real data from online\nsources.

We argue that a triadic\nconceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the\ninformation generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,\nand propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply\ninfluenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,\nwe elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and\nmodern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions\nto the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures\ninvolve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,\nformal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles\nas primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of\nthermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are\nsystems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this\nview, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy\nProduction work together to drive the emergence of information carrying\nstructures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the\ngradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's\nseminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical\nexpression of the Second Law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 04:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-30"}

Data go from the near-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. This\nmultiwavelengths dataset allows us to place strong constraints on the spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies, and thus to efficiently derive\nphysical parameters such as the SFR, the total infrared luminosity, attenuation\nparameters, and star formation history. An important part of this work is\nelaboration of a mock catalogue that allows us to have a reliability criterion\nfor the derived parameters. We studied LIRGs by means of an SED-fitting code\nCIGALE. At first, this code creates synthetic spectra from the Maraston stellar\npopulation models. The stellar population spectra are attenuated by using a\nsynthetic Calzetti-based attenuation law before adding the dust emission as\ngiven by the infrared SED library. The originality of CIGALE is that it allows\nus to perform consistent fits of the dust-affected ultaviolet-to-infrared\nwavelength range. This technique appears to be a very powerful tool in the case\nwhere we can have access to a dataset that is well-sampled over a wide range of\nwavelengths. We are able to derive a star formation history and to estimate the\nfraction of infrared luminosity reprocessed by an active galactic nucleus. We\nstudy the dust temperatures of our galaxies detected at 70 \\mu\\m and find them\ncolder than predicted by models. We also study the relation between the SFR and\nthe stellar mass and do not find a tight correlation between either of them,\nbut instead a flat distribution and a large scatter, which is interpreted in\nterms of variations in star formation history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 09:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 15:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This model is based on the construction of\nan assembly graph containing all viable configurations of the community, and\nthe definition of a Markov chain whose transitions are the transformations of\ncommunities by new species invasions. In the present paper we provide an\nexhaustive numerical analysis of the model, describing the average time to the\nrecurrent state, the statistics of avalanches, and the dependence of the\nresults on the amount of available resource. Our results are based on the fact\nthat the Markov chain provides an asymptotic probability distribution for the\nrecurrent states, which can be used to obtain averages of observables as well\nas the time variation of these magnitudes during succession, in an exact\nmanner. Since the absorption times into the recurrent set are found to be\ncomparable to the size of the system, the end state is quickly reached (in\nunits of the invasion time). Thus, the final ecosystem can be regarded as a\nfluctuating complex system where species are continually replaced by newcomers\nwithout ever leaving the set of recurrent patterns. The assembly graph is\ndominated by pathways in which most invasions are accepted, triggering small\nextinction avalanches. Through the assembly process, communities become less\nresilient (e.g., have a higher return time to equilibrium) but become more\nrobust in terms of resistance against new invasions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 10:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 11:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}

In the case of disk component, the analysis is not\nvery sensitive for obtaining the disk large scale structure, because of the\neffective available area (less than 8% of the whole map and less than 40% of\nthe disk). Nevertheless, within a given family of models, the best-fit\nparameters are compatible with those found in the literature. The family of\nmodels that better describes the polarized synchrotron halo emission is the\naxisymmetric one, with magnetic spiral arms with a pitch angle of ~24 degrees,\nand a strong vertical field of 1 microG at z ~ 1 kpc. When a radial variation\nis fitted, models require fast variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 11:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It is\nfound that these theories can evade solar system tests of post-Newtonian\ngravity remarkably well.

Specifically,\nwe show that the index shift appearing in the Landau levels is related to a\ntopological part of the Berry phase -- which is basically a winding number of\nthe direction of the pseudo-spin 1/2 associated to the coupled bands --\nacquired by an electron during a cyclotron orbit and not to the complete Berry\nphase, as commonly stated. As a consequence, the Landau levels of a coupled\nband insulator are shifted as compared to a usual band insulator. We also study\nin detail the Berry curvature in the whole Brillouin zone on a specific example\n(boron nitride) and show that its computation requires care in defining the\n\"k-dependent Hamiltonian\" H(k), where k is the Bloch wavevector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 14:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 21:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Throughout the years of\ndevelopment of stochastic simulations for HEP, a sophisticated framework\nfeaturing all the above mentioned functionality has been implemented.

Our hierarchical logic-based model of\nhealth combines data from different sources, sensor data, tests results,\ncommon-sense knowledge and patient's clinical profile at the lower level, and\ncorrelation rules between health conditions across upper levels. The logical\nformalization and the reasoning process are based on Answer Set Programming.\nThe expressive power of this logic programming paradigm makes it possible to\nreason about health evolution even when the available information is incomplete\nand potentially incoherent, while declarativity simplifies rules specification\nby caregivers and allows automatic encoding of knowledge.
