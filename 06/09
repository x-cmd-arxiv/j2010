We include both the\ngravitational perturbations of the secondary star and a non-linear gas drag\nstemming from an eccentric gas disk with a finite precession rate. We consider\nseveral precession rates and eccentricities for the gas, and compare the\nresults with a static disk in circular orbit.\n  The disk precession introduces three main differences with respect to the\nclassical static case: (i) The equilibrium secular solutions generated by the\ngas drag are no longer fixed points in the averaged system, but limit cycles\nwith frequency equal to the precession rate of the gas. The amplitude of the\ncycle is inversely dependent on the body size, reaching negligible values for\n$\\sim 50$ km size planetesimals. (ii) The maximum final eccentricity attainable\nby small bodies is restricted to the interval between the gas eccentricity and\nthe forced eccentricity, and apsidal alignment is no longer guaranteed for\nplanetesimals strongly coupled with the gas. (iii) The characteristic\ntimescales of orbital decay and secular evolution decrease significantly with\nincreasing precession rates, with values up to two orders of magnitude smaller\nthan for static disks.\n  Finally, we apply this analysis to the $\\gamma$-Cephei system and estimate\nimpact velocities for different size bodies and values of the gas eccentricity.\nFor high disk eccentricities, we find that the disk precession decreases the\nvelocity dispersion between different size planetesimals, thus contributing to\naccretional collisions in the outer parts of the disk. The opposite occurs for\nalmost circular gas disks, where precession generates an increase in the\nrelative velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 16:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Analyzing a\nnew sample of PCEBs we derive constraints on one of the most important\nparameters in the field of close compact binary formation, i.e. the CE\nefficiency alpha. After reconstructing the post-CE evolution and based on fits\nto stellar evolution calculations as well as a parametrized energy equation for\nCE evolution that incorporates realistic approximations of the binding energy\nparameter lambda, we determine the possible evolutionary histories of the\nobserved PCEBs. We also reconstruct CE evolution replacing the classical energy\nequation with a scaled angular momentum equation and compare the results\nobtained with both algorithms. We find that all PCEBs in our sample can be\nreconstructed with the energy equation if the internal energy of the envelope\nis included. Although most individual systems have solutions for a broad range\nof values for alpha, only for alpha=0.2-0.3 do we find simultaneous solutions\nfor all PCEBs in our sample.

In contrast if we fix gamma to a small range of values that allows us\nto reconstruct all our systems, the possible ranges of values for alpha remains\nbroad for individual systems. The classical parametrized energy equation seems\nto be an appropriate prescription of CE evolution and turns out to constrain\nthe outcome of the CE evolution much more than the alternative angular momentum\nequation.

Szapudi 2004 and Papai &\nSzapudi 2008 provided a methodology, based on tripolar spherical harmonics\nexpansion, for computing the redshift-space correlation function for all\nangular galaxy pair separations. In this paper we introduce a new procedure for\nanalysing wide-angle effects in numerical simulations. We are able to separate,\ndemonstrate, and fit each of the effects described by the wide-angle RSD\ntheory. Our analysis highlights some of the nuances of dealing with wide-angle\npairs, and shows that the effects are not negligible even for relatively small\nangles. This analysis will help to ensure the full exploitation of future\nsurveys for RSD measurements, which are currently confined to pair separations\nless than \\sim80 Mpc/h out to z\\simeq 0.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 20:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\ndepletion of gas resulting from quasar-driven outflows should eventually stop\nstar-formation in the host galaxy and lead the black hole to \"suicide\" for\nstarvation.

Specifically, we\nfocus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer\ndisc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the\nsurrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centre\nof the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the\nfresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum is\ncompletely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot\ngas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned\nouter disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer\ncomponents are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to\ninfalling substructure and accretion. The warped disc feeds the main gas disc\ndue to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in\nthe warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc.

For CMA, a CMA-SSAF strategy is proposed which even\ncan exactly achieve the DMT upper bound with any number of cooperative users.\nIn this way, SSAF strategy is shown to be universally optimal for all these\nthree classical channel models and has great potential to provide universal\noptimality for wireless cooperative networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 21:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-10"}

Two forms of monitoring information are considered,\nviz., locally unique transaction identifiers, and arrival and departure\ntimestamps of transactions at each processing queue. The timestamps are assumed\navailable at all the queues but in the absence of identifiers, only enable\nimprecise tracking since parallel processing can result in out-of-order\ndepartures. On the other hand, identifiers enable precise tracking but are not\navailable without proper instrumentation. Given an instrumentation budget, only\na subset of queues can be selected for production of identifiers, while the\nremaining queues have to resort to imprecise tracking using timestamps. The\ngoal is then to optimally allocate the instrumentation budget to maximize the\noverall tracking accuracy. The challenge is that the optimal allocation\nstrategy depends on accuracies of timestamp-based tracking at different queues,\nwhich has complex dependencies on the arrival and service processes, and the\nqueueing discipline. We propose two simple heuristics for allocation by\npredicting the order of timestamp-based tracking accuracies of different\nqueues. We derive sufficient conditions for these heuristics to achieve\noptimality through the notion of stochastic comparison of queues.

The notion of\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) and an upper bound on the restricted\nisometry constant (RIC) are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the\nexact localization by MUSIC with or without the presence of noise. In the\nnoiseless case, the sufficient condition gives an upper bound on the numbers of\nrandom sampling and incident directions necessary for exact localization. In\nthe noisy case, the sufficient condition assumes additionally an upper bound\nfor the noise-to-object ratio in terms of the RIC and the condition number of\nobjects. Rigorous comparison of performance between MUSIC and the CS\nminimization principle, Lasso, is given. In general, the MUSIC algorithm\nguarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$ scatterers with $n=\\cO(s^2)$\nrandom sampling and incident directions and sufficiently high frequency. For\nthe favorable imaging geometry where the scatterers are distributed on a\ntransverse plane MUSIC guarantees to recover, with high probability, $s$\nscatterers with a median frequency and $n=\\cO(s)$ random sampling/incident\ndirections. Numerical results confirm that the Lasso outperforms MUSIC in the\nwell-resolved case while the opposite is true for the under-resolved case.

We derive radial profiles of Age, total metallicity [Z/H], and\n[alpha/Fe] abundance ratios out to 1 - 3 effective radii by using nearly all of\nthe Lick/IDS absorption-line indices in comparison to recent single stellar\npopulation models. We extend our study to higher galaxy mass via a novel\nliterature compilation of 37 early-type galaxies, which provides stellar\npopulation properties out to one effective radius. We find that metallicity\ngradients correlate with galactic mass, and the relationship shows a sharp\nchange in slope at a dynamical mass of 3.5 10^10 M_{sun}. The central and mean\nvalues of the stellar population parameters (measured in r < r_e/8, and at r =\nr_e, respectively) define positive mass trends. We suggest that the low\nmetallicities, almost solar [alpha/Fe] ratios and the tight mass-metallicity\ngradient relation displayed by the low-mass galaxies are indicative of an early\nstar-forming collapse with extended (i.e., > 1 Gyr), low efficiency star\nformation, and mass-dependent galactic outflows of metal-enriched gas. The\nflattening of metallicity gradients in high-mass galaxies, and the broad\nscatter of the relationship are attributed to merger events. The high\nmetallicities and supersolar abundances shown by these galaxies imply a rapid,\nhigh efficiency star formation. The observed [Z/H]--mass and [alpha/Fe]--mass\nrelationships can be interpreted as a natural outcome of an early star-forming\ncollapse. However, we find that hierarchical galaxy formation models\nimplementing mass-dependent star formation efficiency, varying IMF, energy\nfeedback via AGN, and the effects due to merger-induced starbursts can also\nreproduce both our observed relationships.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 03:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Over several decades, social\nscientists have been interested in the idea that similarity breeds connection:\nprecisely known as \"homophily\". Homophily has been extensively studied in the\nsocial sciences and refers to the idea that users in a social system tend to\nbond more with ones who are similar to them than to ones who are dissimilar.\nThe key observation is that homophily structures the ego-networks of\nindividuals and impacts their communication behavior. It is therefore likely to\neffect the mechanisms in which information propagates among them. To this\neffect, we investigate the interplay between homophily along diverse user\nattributes and the information diffusion process on social media. In our\napproach, we first extract diffusion characteristics---corresponding to the\nbaseline social graph as well as graphs filtered on different user attributes\n(e.g. location, activity). Second, we propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network based\nframework to predict diffusion characteristics at a future time. Third, the\nimpact of attribute homophily is quantified by the ability of the predicted\ncharacteristics in explaining actual diffusion, and external variables,\nincluding trends in search and news. Experimental results on a large Twitter\ndataset demonstrate that choice of the homophilous attribute can impact the\nprediction of information diffusion, given a specific metric and a topic. In\nmost cases, attribute homophily is able to explain the actual diffusion and\nexternal trends by ~15-25% over cases when homophily is not considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 04:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-10"}

We can trace\nback each failure of SPH to show KH rolls to two causes: i) shock waves\ntravelling in the simulation box and ii) particle clumping, or more generally,\nparticle noise. The probable cause of shock waves is the Local Mixing\nInstability (LMI), previously identified in the literature.

For a mathematical model introduced in\n[1],[2], we identify three regimes of operation for our algorithm (named\nPopularity Amongst Friends (PAF)) in the limit as the matrix size grows to\ninfinity. In a regime characterized by large number of samples and small\ndegrees of freedom (defined precisely for the model in the paper), the\nasymptotic BER is zero; in a regime characterized by large number of samples\nand large degrees of freedom, the asymptotic BER is bounded away from 0 and 1/2\n(and is identified exactly except for a special case); and in a regime\ncharacterized by a small number of samples, the algorithm fails. We also\npresent numerical results for the MovieLens and Netflix datasets. We discuss\nthe empirical performance in light of our theoretical results and compare with\nan approach based on low-rank matrix completion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 11:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 10:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2011 07:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The precise origin of the eruption is still\ndebated. Among several mechanisms, it has been proposed that a loss of\nequilibrium, or an ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instability such as the\ntorus instability, could be responsible for the sudden eruptivity. Distinct\napproaches have also been formulated for limit cases having circular or\ntranslation symmetry. We revisit the previous theoretical approaches, setting\nthem in the same analytical framework. The coronal field results from the\ncontribution of a non-neutralized current channel added to a background\nmagnetic field, which in our model is the potential field generated by two\nphotospheric flux concentrations. The evolution on short Alfvenic time scale is\ngoverned by ideal MHD. We show analytically first that the loss of equilibrium\nand the stability analysis are two different views of the same physical\nmechanism. Second, we identify that the same physics is involved in the\ninstability of circular and straight current channels. Indeed, they are just\ntwo particular limiting case of more general current paths. A global\ninstability of the magnetic configuration is present when the current channel\nis located at a coronal height, h, large enough so that the decay index of the\npotential field, (d ln |Bp|) / (d ln h) is larger than a critical value. At the\nlimit of very thin current channels, previous analysis found a critical decay\nindex of 1.5 and 1 for circular and straight current channels, respectively.\nHowever, with current channels being deformable and as thick as expected in the\ncorona, we show that this critical index has similar values for circular and\nstraight current channels, typically in the range [1.1,1.3].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 12:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Furthermore, by\ntuning gate voltages one has access to splitting of the Andreev excitation\nenergies, which is visible in the differential conductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 12:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-08"}

The present day increase of computing power,\nwhich allows for the exploration of different configurations of turbulence in\nconducting flows, and the development of shell-to-shell transfer functions, has\nled to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic\nfield and between scales. In particular, processes such as induction and dynamo\naction, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, or the\ndevelopment of anisotropies, can be characterized at different scales. In this\ncontext we consider three different configurations often studied in the\nliterature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and\nturbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is\nof interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and\nnon-local transfers are discussed for each case.

This paper explores the further\nadvantage afforded by the indication that QWSCs operate in the radiative limit\nbecause radiative contribution to the dark current is seen to dominate in\nexperimental data at biases corresponding to operation under concentration. The\ndark currents of QWSCs are analysed in terms of a light and dark current model.\nThe model calculates the spectral response (QE) from field bearing regions and\ncharge neutral layers and from the quantum wells by calculating the confined\ndensities of states and absorption coefficient, and solving transport equations\nanalytically. The total dark current is expressed as the sum of depletion layer\nand charge neutral radiative and non radiative currents consistent with\nparameter values extracted from QE fits to data. The depletion layer dark\ncurrent is a sum of Shockley-Read-Hall non radiative, and radiative\ncontributions. The charge neutral region contribution is expressed in terms of\nthe ideal Shockley radiative and non-radiative currents modified to include\nsurface recombination. This analysis shows that the QWSC is inherently subject\nto the fundamental radiative efficiency limit at high currents where the\nradiative dark current dominates, whereas good homojunction cells are well\ndescribed by the ideal Shockley picture where the limit is determined by\nradiative and non radiative recombination in the charge neutral layers of the\ncell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 15:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-10"}
