Since PAH molecules trace the gas disk, this\nindicates that gas disks may still be flared, while the dust disk has settled\ndue to grain growth. There are indications that the strength of the 11.3 um\nfeature also depends on dust disk structure, with flattened disks being less\nbright in this feature. We confirm that the CC bond features at 6.2 and 7.8 um\nshift to redder wavelengths with decreasing stellar effective temperature.\nMoreover, we show that this redshift is accompanied by a relative increase of\naliphatic CH emission and a decrease of the aromatic 8.6 um CH feature\nstrength. Cool stars in our sample are surrounded by hydrocarbons with a high\naliphatic/aromatic CH ratio and a low aromatic CH/CC ratio, and vice versa for\nthe hot stars. We conclude that, while the overall hydrocarbon emission\nstrength depends on the dust disk's geometry, the relative differences seen in\nthe IR emission features in disks around Herbig Ae stars are mainly due to\nchemical differences of the hydrocarbon molecules induced by the stellar UV\nfield. Strong UV flux reduces the aliphatic component and emphasizes the\nspectral signature of the aromatic molecules in the IR spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2010 18:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By using electromagnetic calorimeter-based and jet substructure\nanalyses, we show in two cases of different $\\chi$ masses that it is quite\npromising to extract the signal of Higgs boson out of large QCD background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2010 23:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 02:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-08"}

The numerical\nmethod used includes a high resolution fifth-order weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory scheme for spatial discretization, coupled with a third order\ntotal variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time stepping method. Two types of\ndisturbances are used for the initial perturbation. One is a random disturbance\nwhich is imposed on the whole area of the detonation front, and the other is a\nsymmetrical disturbance imposed within a band along the diagonal direction on\nthe front. The results show that the two types of disturbances lead to\ndifferent processes. For the random disturbance, the detonation front evolves\ninto a stable spinning detonation. For the symmetrical diagonal disturbance,\nthe detonation front displays a diagonal pattern at an early stage, but this\npattern is unstable. It breaks down after a short while and it finally evolves\ninto a spinning detonation. The spinning detonation structure ultimately formed\ndue to the two types of disturbances is the same. This means that spinning\ndetonation is the most stable mode for the simulated narrow duct. Therefore, in\na narrow duct, triggering a spinning detonation can be an effective way to\nproduce a stable detonation as well as to speed up the deflagration to\ndetonation transition process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 04:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this paper a new interactions are defined for object oriented\nsystem. Using these interactions, a parser is developed to analyze the existing\narchitecture of the software. Within the design model, it is necessary for\ndesign classes to collaborate with one another. However, collaboration should\nbe kept to an acceptable minimum i.e. better designing practice will introduce\nlow coupling. If a design model is highly coupled, the system is difficult to\nimplement, to test and to maintain overtime. In case of enhancing software, we\nneed to introduce or remove module and in that case coupling is the most\nimportant factor to be considered because unnecessary coupling may make the\nsystem unstable and may cause reduction in the system's performance. So\ncoupling is thought to be a desirable goal in software construction, leading to\nbetter values for external software qualities such as maintainability,\nreusability and so on. To test this hypothesis, a good measure of class\ncoupling is needed.

Using millimetre surveys of\ndiscs within six local star-formation regions, we confirm this result, and find\nthat only a few percent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to\nbuild gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency\nof observed exo-planets is greater than this, there is a `missing mass'\nproblem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust-flux to\ndisc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets\ncould hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but\ntrends in multi-planet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical\nmodels suggest that the gas accretion timescale is too short for migration to\nsweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with\npredictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to\nmillimetre dust-flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the\nincidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the {\\it proto}stellar\nstages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via\ncore accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exo-planets.\nGravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the\nobjects have potentially unstable discs of $\\ga$30 % of the stellar mass.\nHowever, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 AU by\ninstability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results\npresented suggest that the canonically 'proto-planetary' discs of Class II T\nTauri stars {\\bf have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre\nwavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to\nplanetary cores) must already have occurred.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 10:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Therefore, some cooling mechanism, for example\ndissipational effects of the interstellar medium, was assumed to be necessary\nto keep the spiral arms. Here we show that stellar disks can maintain spiral\nfeatures for several tens of rotations without the help of cooling, using a\nseries of high-resolution three-dimensional $N$-body simulations of pure\nstellar disks. We found that if the number of particles is sufficiently large,\ne.g., $3\\times 10^6$, multi-arm spirals developed in an isolated disk can\nsurvive for more than 10 Gyrs. We confirmed that there is a self-regulating\nmechanism that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms. Spiral arms increase\nToomre's $Q$ of the disk, and the heating rate correlates with the squared\namplitude of the spirals. Since the amplitude itself is limited by the value of\n$Q$, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of\nevolution. A simple analytical argument suggests that the heating is caused by\ngravitational scattering of stars by spiral arms, and that the self-regulating\nmechanism in pure-stellar disks can effectively maintain spiral arms on a\ncosmological timescale. In the case of a smaller number of particles, e.g.,\n$3\\times 10^5$, spiral arms grow faster in the beginning of the simulation\n(while $Q$ is small) and they cause a rapid increase of $Q$. As a result, the\nspiral arms become faint in several Gyrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 10:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 09:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 13:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2011 11:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\nprobability distribution function of Rx was functionally fitted as dependent on\nthe X-ray luminosity and redshift, P(Rx|Lx,z). It roughly spans over 6 decades\n(-7<Rx<-1), and does not show any sign of bi-modality. It resulted that the\nprobability of finding large values of the Rx ratio increases with decreasing\nX-ray luminosities and (possibly) with increasing redshift. No statistical\nsignificant difference was found between the radio properties of the X-ray\nabsorbed and unabsorbed AGN. The measure of the probability distribution\nfunction of Rx allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and the\nkinetic energy density which, at variance with what assumed in many galaxy\nevolution models, is observed to decrease of about a factor of five at redshift\nbelow 0.5. About half of the kinetic energy density results to be produced by\nthe more radio quiet (Rx<-4) AGN. In agreement with previous estimates, the AGN\nefficiency in converting the accreted mass energy into kinetic power is, on\naverage, ~5x10-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 12:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These papers develop a new direction\nof the microcosm physics. It is so-called geometric paradigm, which is\nalternative to the quantum paradigm, which is conventionally used now. The\nhypothesis on discreteness of the space-time geometry appears to be more\nfundamental, than the hypothesis on quantum nature of microcosm. Discrete\nspace-time geometry admits one to describe quantum effects as pure geometric\neffects. Mathematical technique of the microcosm physics geometrization\n(geometric paradigm) is based on the physical geometry, which is described\ncompletely by the world function. Equations, describing motion of particles in\nthe microcosm, are algebraic (not differential) equations. They are written in\na coordinateless form in terms of world function. The geometric paradigm\nappeared as a result of overcoming of inconsistency of the conventional\nelementary particle theory. In the suggested skeleton conception the state of\nan elementary particle is described by its skeleton (several space-time\npoints). The skeleton contains all information on the particle properties\n(mass, charge, spin, etc.). The skeleton conception is a monistic construction,\nwhere elementary particle motion is described in terms of skeleton and world\nfunction and only in these terms. The skeleton conception can be constructed\nonly on the basis of the physical geometry. Unfortunately, most mathematicians\ndo not accept the physical geometries, because these geometries are\nnonaxiomatizable. It is a repetition of the case, when mathematicians did not\naccept the non-Euclidean geometries of Lobachevsky-Bolyai. As a result this\nreview is a review of papers of one author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 13:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 08:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-28"}
