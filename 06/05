Our approach is based on the Polchinski-Rocha model of loop formation\nfrom long strings which we adjust to fit numerical simulations and complement\nby a phenomenological modelling of gravitational backreaction. Cosmological\nevolution drives the loop distribution towards scaling on all length scales in\nboth the radiation and matter era. Memory of any reasonable initial loop\ndistribution in the radiation era is shown to be erased well before Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis. In the matter era, the loop distribution reaches full scaling,\nup to some residual loops from the radiation era which may be present for\nextremely low string tension. Finally, the number density of loops below the\ngravitational cutoff is shown to be scale independent, proportional to a\nnegative power of the string tension and insensitive to the details of the\nbackreaction modelling. As an application, we show that the energy density\nparameter of loops today cannot exceed 10^(-5) for currently allowed string\ntension values, while the loop number density cannot be less than 10^(-6) per\nMpc^3. Our result should provide a more robust basis for studying the\ncosmological consequences of cosmic string loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 16:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 14:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-21"}

Three\nclasses of inorganic precursors have been modeled: terminal (R-Si-(OEt)3) and\nbridging ((EtO)3-Si-R-Si-(OEt)3)) organosilica precursors (OSPs), along with\npure silica precursors (Si-(OEt)4). Each class has been studied by analyzing\nits solubility in the solvent and the solvophobicity of the inorganic group. At\nhigh surfactant concentrations, periodic ordered structures, such as\nhexagonally-ordered cylinders or lamellas, can be obtained depending on the\nOSPs used. Ordered structures were obtained in a wider range of conditions when\nbridging hydrophilic OSPs have been used, because a higher surfactant\nconcentration was reached in the phase where the material was formed. Terminal\nand bridging OSPs produced ordered structures only when the organic group is\nsolvophilic. In this case, a partial solubility between the precursor and the\nsolvent or a lower temperature favored the formation of ordered phases. With\nparticular interest, we have analyzed the range of conditions leaving to the\nformation of cylindrical structures, which have been evaluated according to the\npore size distribution, the pore wall thickness, the distribution and the\naccessibility of the functional organic groups around the pores. The phase\nbehavior has been also evaluated by applying the quasi-chemical theory, which\ncannot predict the formation of ordered structures, but confirmed the results\nof simulations when no ordered structures were observed.

For stars with M > 0.85\nMsun the rotation periods, vsini and radius estimates are consistent with the\nstars having an isotropic distribution of rotation axes, if a moderate\ndifferential rotation law is assumed. For stars with M < 0.85 Msun the inferred\nsini values are systematically larger than 1.0. These observations imply that\nthe combination of measured parameters P(vsini)/R is too large by \\sim 24% for\nlow-mass stars in this cluster. By comparing our new mass-period relation for\nthe Pleiades to the slightly older cluster M35, we confirm previous indications\nthat the spin-down stalls at \\sim 100 Myr for the slowest rotating stars with\n0.7 Msun < M < 1.1 Msun a fact which may indicate that the internal transport\nof angular momentum is inefficient in slowly rotating solar mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 17:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-07"}

That is why both phenomena should be\ntaken into account at once, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since,\nunder the above transition, the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum (filled up with\ngluon- and chiral $q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation)\nsubhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, the formerly (very high) pressure falls\ndown rather abruptly, the formerly cold nuclear medium starts imploding almost\nfreely into the new vacuum. If the star mass is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion is shown to result in an enormous heating - up to the temperature\nabout 100 MeV or, may be, even higher - and growth of the inner pressure due to\ndegeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair production which withstands the\ngravitational compression (remind that the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts, as well as of the \"normal\" NS, are, at least, of one order lower). As a\nconsequence, a \"flaming wall\" is, most probably, emerged on the way of further\ncollapsing which prevents the NS to evolve towards the BH horizon appearance.\nAt the same time, it could give rise to the most powerful GRBs produced by some\nvery distant (young) stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 17:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-08"}

We investigate both quantitative (GALFIT)\nand qualitative (visual) morphologies of these AGN host galaxies, split by\nbrightness in their selection band. We find that the radio-selected AGN are\nmost distinct, with a very low incidence of having unresolved optical\nmorphologies and a high incidence of being hosted by early-type galaxies. In\ncomparison to X-ray selected AGN, mid-IR selected AGN have a slightly higher\nincidence of being hosted by disk galaxies. These morphological results conform\nwith the results of Hickox et al. 2009 who studied the colors and large-scale\nclustering of AGN, and found a general association of radio-selected AGN with\n``red sequence'' galaxies, mid-IR selected AGN with ``blue cloud'' galaxies,\nand X-ray selected AGN straddling these samples in the ``green valley.'' In the\ngeneral scenario where AGN activity marks and regulates the transition from\nlate-type disk galaxies into massive elliptical galaxies, this work suggests\nthat the earlier stages are most evident as mid-IR selected AGNs. Mid-IR\nemission is less susceptible to absorption than the relatively soft X-rays\nprobed by XMM-Newton, which are seen at later stages in the transition.\nRadio-selected AGN are then typically associated with minor bursts of activity\nin the most massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 01:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

We developed a\nsimple method that uses a chi-square-based scoring function to determine the\nlikelihood of MEDLINE citations containing genetic relevant topic. Methods: Our\nprocedure requires construction of a genetic and a nongenetic domain document\ncorpus. We used MeSH descriptors assigned to MEDLINE citations for this\ncategorization task. We compared frequencies of MeSH descriptors between two\ncorpora applying chi-square test. A MeSH descriptor was considered to be a\npositive indicator if its relative observed frequency in the genetic domain\ncorpus was greater than its relative observed frequency in the nongenetic\ndomain corpus. The output of the proposed method is a list of scores for all\nthe citations, with the highest score given to those citations containing MeSH\ndescriptors typical for the genetic domain. Results: Validation was done on a\nset of 734 manually annotated MEDLINE citations. It achieved predictive\naccuracy of 0.87 with 0.69 recall and 0.64 precision.

We have investigated\nthe eclipse transitions of Cen X-3 in different intensity states with data\nobtained from pointed observations with the more sensitive instruments on board\nASCA, BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton, Chandra and RXTE. We found a very clear trend of\nsharp eclipse transitions in the high state and longer transitions in the low\nstate. This is a confirmation of this feature first observed with the RXTE-ASM\nbut now with much better clarity. From the light curves obtained from several\nmissions, it is seen that the eclipse egress in the low state starts earlier by\nan orbital phase of 0.02 indicating that the observed X-rays originate from a\nmuch larger region. We have also performed spectral analysis of the\npost-eclipse part of each observations. From BeppoSAX observations, the\nout-of-eclipse X-ray fluxes is found to differ by a factor of ~ 26 during the\nhigh and low intensity states while the eclipse count rates differ by a factor\nof only ~ 4.7. This indicates that in the low state, there is an additional\nscattering medium which scatters some of the source photons towards the\nobserver even when the neutron star is completely eclipsed. We could also\nresolve the three iron line components using XMM-Newton observation in the low\nstate. By comparing the iron line equivalent width during the high and low\nstates, it is seen that the width of iron line is relatively large during the\nlow state which supports the fact that significant reprocessing and scattering\nof X-rays takes place in the low state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 10:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}

A simple optical model is used to\ncalculate the contrast for nanolayers deposited on wafers with varying\nthickness of SiO2. The model is extended for imaging using the green channel of\na video camera. Using AFM and optical imaging we confirm that single layers of\nMoS2, WSe2 and NbSe2 can be detected on 90nm and 270 nm SiO2 using optical\nmeans. By measuring contrast under broad-band green illumination we are also\nable to distinguish between nanostructures containing single, mono and triple\nlayers of MoS2, WSe2 and NbSe2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 13:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-01"}

This point of view makes\nevident the tendency to minimization of the length of the contact line at\nequilibrium. The concept of line tension is, however, of limited applicability,\nin view of a qualitatively different relaxation response of the contact line,\ncompared to a two-dimensional curve. Both the analogy and qualitative\ndistinction extend to a non-equilibrium situation arising due to coupling with\nreversible substrate modification. Under these conditions, the contact line may\nsuffer a variety of chemo-capillary instabilities (fingering, traveling and\noscillatory), similar to those of dissipative structures in nonlinear\nnon-equilibrium systems. The preference order of the various instabilities\nchanges, however, significantly due to a different way the interfacial\ncurvature is relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 15:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Previous work has shown that QWSCs have a\ngreater open circuit voltage (Voc) than would be provided by a cell with the\nquantum well effective bandgap. This suggests that the fundamental efficiency\nlimits of QWSCs are greater than those of single bandgap solar cells. The\nfollowing work investigates QWSCs in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs materials system. The\ndesign and optimisation of a QWSC in this system requires studies of the\nvoltage and current dependencies on the aluminium fraction. QWSCs with\ndifferent aluminium fractions have been studied and show an increasing Voc with\nincreasing barrier aluminium composition. The QE however decreases with\nincreasing aluminium composition. We develop a model of the QE to test novel\nQWSC designs with a view to minimising this problem. This work concentrates on\ntwo design changes. The first deals with com- positionally graded structures in\nwhich the bandgap varies with position. This bandgap variation introduces an\nquasi electric field which can be used to increase minority carrier collection\nin the low efficiency p and n layers. This technique also increases the light\nflux reaching the highly efficient depletion regions. The second design change\nconsists of coating the back of the cell with a mirror to exploit the portion\nof light which is not absorbed on the first pass. A model of the QE of\ncompositionally graded QWSC solar cells with back surface mirrors is developed\nin order to analyse the effect of these design changes. These changes are\nimplemented separately in a number of QWSC designs and the resulting\nexperimental data compared with the model. An optimised design is then\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 15:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-08"}
