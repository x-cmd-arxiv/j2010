With the introduction of novel\nbehavior-aware protocols, services and architectures, there is a pressing need\nto understand and realistically model mobile users behavioral characteristics,\ntheir similarity and clustering. Such models are essential for the analysis,\nperformance evaluation, and simulation of future DTNs. This paper addresses\nissues related to mobile user similarity, its definition, analysis and\nmodeling. To define similarity, we adopt a behavioral-profile based on users\nlocation preferences using their on-line association matrix and its SVD, then\ncalculate the behavioral distance to capture user similarity. This measures the\ndifference of the major spatio-temporal behavioral trends and can be used to\ncluster users into similarity groups or communities. We then analyze and\ncontrast similarity distributions of mobile user populations in two settings:\n(i) based on real measurements from four major campuses with over ten thousand\nusers for a month, and (ii) based on existing mobility models, including random\ndirection and time-varying community models. Our results show a rich set of\nsimilar communities in real mobile societies with distinct behavioral clusters\nof users. This is true for all the traces studied, with the trend being\nconsistent over time. Surprisingly, however, we find that the existing mobility\nmodels do not explicitly capture similarity and result in homogeneous users\nthat are all similar to each other. Thus the richness and diversity of user\nbehavioral patterns is not captured to any degree in the existing models. These\nfindings strongly suggest that similarity should be explicitly captured in\nfuture mobility models, which motivates the need to re-visit mobility modeling\nin the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 18:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

A joint analysis of X-ray and radio maps suggests that\npressure values of non-thermal radio-emitting particles derived from the radio\nmaps are not sufficient to inflate the X-ray cavities. We propose using the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, whose intensity strongly depends on the\npressure, to find the hitherto undetected, dynamically-dominant component in\nthe radio cocoons.\n  We demonstrate that the spectral function at a frequency of 217 GHz has an\nabsolute maximum at a temperature higher than $10^9$ K, therefore the\nmeasurement of the SZ effect at this frequency is a powerful tool for\npotentially revealing the dynamically-dominant component inside AGN jet-driven\nradio cocoons. A new method is proposed for excluding the contribution from the\nlow energy, non-relativistic electrons to the SZ effect by means of\nobservations at two frequencies. We show how one may correct for a possible\ncontribution from the kinematic SZ effect. The intensity maps of the SZ effect\nare calculated for the self-similar Sedov solution, and application of a\npredicted ring-like structure on the SZ map at a frequency of 217 GHz is\nproposed to determine the energy released during the active jet stage. The SZ\nintensity map for an AGN cocoon in a distant elliptical is calculated using a\n2-D numerical simulation and including relativistic corrections to the SZ\neffect. We show the intensity spectrum of the SZ effect is flat at high\nfrequencies if gas temperature is as high as $k_\\mathrm{b} T_{\\mathrm{e}}=500$\nkeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 20:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Matching shocked piecewise isothermal self-similar void (ISSV)\nsolutions with self-gravity of Lou & Zhai (LZ) for the outer zone and a\nstationary isothermal fast tenuous wind with a reverse shock for the inner zone\nacross an expanding contact discontinuity, we can consistently construct\ndynamic evolution models of PNe with diffuse X-ray emissions.

The individuals in the population choose a strategy that defines how\nthey use their available time over the course of their life for feeding, for\nreproducing (say laying eggs), or split their energy in between these two\nactivities. We here suppose that their life lasts a full season, so that the\nchosen strategy results in the production of a certain number of eggs laid over\nthe season. This number then helps define the long-run evolution of the\npopulation since the eggs constitute the basis for the population for the next\nseason. However, in this paper, we strictly concentrate on what occurs within a\nseason, by considering two possible strategies: the collective optimum and the\nuninvadable strategy. The (collective) optimal strategy involves a singular\narc, which has some resource saving feature and may, on the long-term, lead to\nan equilibrium. However, it is susceptible to invasion by a greedy mutant which\nfree-rides on this resource saving strategy. Therefore, the \"optimal\" strategy\nis not evolutionarily stable. We thus look for an evolutionarily stable\nstrategy, using the first ESS condition (\"Nash-Wardrop condition\"). This yields\na different singular arc and a strategy that conserves less the resource.\nUnfortunately, we show in a forthcoming paper that, though it is an ESS, it is\nnot long-term (interseasonal) sustainable.

We examine the use of MPS as an approximation method,\nlooking at parallels between the interpretations of applying it to quantum\nstate vectors and probability distributions. In the context of stochastic\nsystems we consider two types of factorization for use in the TEBD algorithm:\nnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which ensures that the approximate\nprobability distribution is manifestly non-negative, and the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD). Comparing these factorizations we find the accuracy of the\nSVD to be substantially greater than current NMF algorithms. We then apply TEBD\nto simulate the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) for systems\nof up to hundreds of lattice sites in size. Using exact analytic results for\nthe TASEP steady state, we find that TEBD reproduces this state such that the\nerror in calculating expectation values can be made negligible, even when\nseverely compressing the description of the system by restricting the dimension\nof the MPS to be very small.

First, we explore connections of exotic smoothings\nof R^4 and certain configurations of NS and D-branes, both classical and\n(generalized) quantum using C* algebras. Effects of some small exotic R^4's,\nwhen localized on S^3, correspond to stringy geometries of B-fields on S^3.\nExotic smoothness of R^4 acts as a non-vanishing B-field on S^3. The dynamics\nof D-branes in SU(2) WZW model at finite k indicates the exoticness of ambient\nR^4. Next, based on the relation of exotic smooth R^4 with integral levels of\nSU(2) WZW model we show the correspondence between exotic smoothness on\n4-space, transversal to the world volume of NS5 branes, and the number of these\nNS5 branes. Relation with the calculations in holographically dual\n6-dimensional little string theory is discussed. Generalized quantum D-branes\nin the noncommutative C* algebras corresponding to the codimension-1 foliations\nof S^3 are considered and these determine the KK invariants of exotic smooth\nR_h^4 for the case of non-integral $[h]\\in H^3(S^3,R)$. Moreover, exotic smooth\nR^4's embedded in some exotic R^4 as open submanifolds, are shown to correspond\nto generalized quantum D-branes in the noncommutative C* algebra of the\nfoliation.

It is shown\nthat the basic properties and the scaling behavior of HF metals can be\ndescribed within the framework of a fermion condensation quantum phase\ntransition (FCQPT) and extended quasiparticle paradigm that allow us to explain\nthe non-Fermi liquid behavior observed in strongly correlated Fermi systems.

This additional component\ncould account for HESS observations at superior conjunction in the system. A\nsemi-analytical and a Monte Carlo method for computing three-dimensional\ncascade radiation are presented and applied in the context of binaries.\nThree-dimensional cascade radiation contributes significantly at every orbital\nphase in the TeV lightcurve, and dominates close to superior conjunction. The\namplitude of the gamma-ray modulation is correctly reproduced for an\ninclination of the orbit of about 40 degrees. Primary pairs should be injected\nclose to the compact object location, otherwise the shape of the modulation is\nnot explained. In addition, synchrotron emission from the cascade in X-rays\nconstrains the ambient magnetic field to below 10 G. The radiation from a\nthree-dimensional pair cascade can account for the TeV flux detected by HESS at\nsuperior conjunction in LS 5039, but the very-high energy spectrum at low\nfluxes remains difficult to explain in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 12:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Two\nelements in a poset are indistinguishable if they have the same strict up-set\nand the same strict down-set. Being indistinguishable defines an equivalence\nrelation on the elements of the poset. We introduce the statistic maxindist,\nthe maximum size of a set of indistinguishable elements. We show that, under a\nbijection of Bousquet-Melou et al., indistinguishable elements correspond to\nletters that belong to the same run in the so-called ascent sequence\ncorresponding to the poset. We derive the generating function for the number of\n(2+2)-free posets with respect to both maxindist and the number of different\nstrict down-sets of elements in the poset.

We have\nresolved the system in a Chandra X-ray observation and detected only the\nprimary, FU Tau A. Hard X-ray emission, presumably from a corona, is present\nbut, unexpectedly, we detect also a strong and unusually soft component from FU\nTau A. Its X-ray properties, so far unique among brown dwarfs, are very similar\nto those of the T Tauri star TW Hya. The analogy with TW Hya suggests that the\ndominating soft X-ray component can be explained by emission from accretion\nshocks. However, the typical free-fall velocities of a brown dwarf are too low\nfor an interpretation of the observed X-ray temperature as post-shock region.\nOn the other hand, velocities in excess of the free-fall speed are derived from\narchival optical spectroscopy, and independent pieces of evidence for strong\naccretion in FU Tau A are found in optical photometry. The high X-ray\nluminosity of FU Tau A coincides with a high bolometric luminosity confirming\nan unexplained trend among young brown dwarfs. In fact, FU Tau A is\noverluminous with respect to evolutionary models while FU Tau B is on the 1 Myr\nisochrone suggesting non-contemporaneous formation of the two components in the\nbinary. The extreme youth of FU Tau A could be responsible for its peculiar\nX-ray properties, in terms of atypical magnetic activity or accretion.\nAlternatively, rotation and magnetic field effects may reduce the efficiency of\nconvection which in turn affects the effective temperature and radius of FU Tau\nA shifting its position in the HR diagram.

In particular, a simple\nC*-algebra is defined to be (tracially) (m,\\bar{m})-pure, if it has (strong\ntracial) m-comparison and is (tracially) \\bar{m}-almost divisible. These\nnotions are related to each other, and to nuclear dimension. The main result\nsays that if a separable, simple, nonelementary, unital C*-algebra A with\nlocally finite nuclear dimension is (m,\\bar{m})-pure, then it absorbs the\nJiang-Su algebra Z tensorially. It follows that A is Z-stable if and only if it\nhas the Cuntz semigroup of a Z-stable C*-algebra. The result may be regarded as\na version of Kirchberg's celebrated theorem that separable, simple, nuclear,\npurely infinite C*-algebras absorb the Cuntz algebra O_\\infty tensorially.

Here, the method proposed optimizes an\narbitrary number of variables by the minimization of a function of a single\nvariable. Such a technique avoids problems associated with multiple minima and\nmaxima because of the large number of parameters, and could increase the\naccuracy of the determination by cutting down on machine errors. An algorithm\nfor this optimization scheme is provided and applied to the determination of\nthe rate constant and final concentration parameters for a first order and\nsecond order chemical reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 15:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

In situ surface X-ray\ndiffraction during and after film growth turned out to be an efficient tool for\nthe determination of twin fractions in multilayer films and to uncover the\nnature of side twin boundaries. The annealing of the twin structures is shown\nto take place in a two step process, reducing first the length of the\nboundaries between differently stacked areas and only then the twins\nthemselves. A model for the structure of the side twin boundaries is proposed\nwhich is consistent with both the scanning tunneling microscopy and surface\nX-ray diffraction data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 15:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

Rosinger","title":"Two Theories of Special Relativity ?","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.gen-ph","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Recently, [3], it was shown that Special Relativity is in fact based on one\nsingle physical axiom which is that of Reciprocity. Originally, Einstein, [1],\nestablished Special Relativity on two physical axioms, namely, the Galilean\nRelativity and the Constancy of the Speed of Light in inertial reference\nframes. Soon after, [4,5], it was shown that the Galilean Relativity alone is\nsufficient for Special Relativity. Here it is important to note that,\nimplicitly, three more assumptions have been used on space-time coordinate\ntransformations, namely, the homogeneity of space-time, the isotropy of space,\nand a mathematical condition of smoothness type. In [3], a boundedness\ncondition on space-time coordinate transformations is used instead of a usual\nmathematical smoothness type condition. In this paper it is shown that the\nrespective boundedness condition is closely related to a Principle of\nTransformation Increment Ratio Limitation, or in short, PTIRL, which has an\nobvious physical meaning. It is also shown that PTIRL is {\\it not} a stronger\nassumption than that of the mentioned boundedness in [3]. Of interest is the\nfact that, by formulating PTIRL as a physical axiom, the possibility is opened\nup for the acceptance, or on the contrary, rejection of this physical axiom\nPTIRL, thus leading to {\\it two} possible theories of Special Relativity. And\nto add further likelihood to such a possibility, the rejection of PTIRL leads\neasily to effects which involve unlimited time and/or space intervals, thus are\nnot accessible to usual experimentation for the verification of their validity,\nor otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2010 10:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 07:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-17"}
