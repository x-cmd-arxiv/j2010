Long ago Vladimirsky (1942) proposed a simple method for solving\nsuch equations. The method, based on the classical Gibbs statistics, consists\nin converting the stochastic LE into a deterministic one, and is applicable to\nlinear equations with any kind of memory. When the memory effects are taken\ninto account in the description of the BM, the mean square displacement of the\nparticle at long times can exhibit an \"anomalous\" (different from that in the\nEinstein theory) time dependence. In the present paper we show how some general\nproperties of such anomalous BM can be easily derived using the Vladimirsky\napproach. The method can be effectively used in solving many of the problems\ncurrently considered in the literature. We apply it to the description of the\nBM when the memory kernel in the Volterra-type integro-differential LE\nexponentially decreases with the time.

To\ncheck this possibility steady torsional stress was applied to DNA in the course\nof all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that small static\nuntwisting significantly reduces the torsional persistence length ($l_t$) of\nGC-alternating DNA. For the AT-alternating sequence a smaller effect of the\nopposite sign is observed. As a result, the measured $l_t$ values are similar\nunder zero stress, but diverge with untwisting. The effect is traced to\nsequence-specific asymmetry of local torsional fluctuations, and it should be\nsmall in long random DNA due to compensation. In contrast, the stiffness of\nspecial short sequences can vary significantly, which gives a simple\npossibility of gene regulation via probabilities of strong fluctuations.
