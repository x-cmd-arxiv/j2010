Such semantic\ncomparisons are usually characterized by various selections of models in the\nlogic of Here-and-There (HT). For uniform equivalence however, correct\ncharacterizations in terms of HT-models can only be obtained for finite\ntheories, respectively programs. In this article, we show that a selection of\ncountermodels in HT captures uniform equivalence also for infinite theories.\nThis result is turned into coherent characterizations of the different notions\nof equivalence by countermodels, as well as by a mixture of HT-models and\ncountermodels (so-called equivalence interpretations). Moreover, we generalize\nthe so-called notion of relativized hyperequivalence for programs to\npropositional theories, and apply the same methodology in order to obtain a\nsemantic characterization which is amenable to infinite settings. This allows\nfor a lifting of the results to first-order theories under a very general\nsemantics given in terms of a quantified version of HT. We thus obtain a\ngeneral framework for the study of various notions of equivalence for theories\nunder answer-set semantics. Moreover, we prove an expedient property that\nallows for a simplified treatment of extended signatures, and provide further\nresults for non-ground logic programs. In particular, uniform equivalence\ncoincides under open and ordinary answer-set semantics, and for finite\nnon-ground programs under these semantics, also the usual characterization of\nuniform equivalence in terms of maximal and total HT-models of the grounding is\ncorrect, even for infinite domains, when corresponding ground programs are\ninfinite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 16:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-16"}

In this work, we derive the expected detection frequency of\nstellar companions of hot-jupiter transiting planets host-stars, detectable by\nmeans of transit timing analysis. Since roughly half of the stars in the solar\nneighborhood belong to binary or multiple stellar systems, the same fraction of\nbinary systems may be expected to be present among transiting planet-host\nstars, unless planet formation is significantly influenced by the presence of a\nstellar companion. Transit searches are less affected by the selection biases\nagainst long-period binaries that plague radial velocity surveys.

In most of the parameter space, first KK excitation of SM hypercharge\ngauge boson is the lightest one and it can be a viable dark matter candidate.\nThus, the decay of $n=1$ KK particles will always involve missing transverse\nenergy as well as leptons and jets.

The capacitance/unit length and the Faraday inductance/unit\nlength, of a flat metal surface, are C'=2epsilon_okW, and L'=epsilon_o/2kW\nrespectively, (where k is wave-vector, and W is the width of the flat metal\nsurface). We believe that many other metal-optic geometries can be described\nwithin the circuit paradigm, with the prerequisite that the distributed\ncapacitance and inductance must be calculated for each particular geometry\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 02:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 03:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 01:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 22:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2010 21:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The relatively high\ndegree of polarization for the component A may arise from its complex radio\nstructure, which is resolvable at 86 GHz.

The first\nsystem, described by the equilibrium model A, corresponds to relaxational\ndynamics of a non-conserved order parameter. The second one is the strongly\nnon-equilibrium reaction-diffusion system, known as Gribov process and\nequivalent to the Reggeon field theory. The turbulent mixing is modelled by the\nKazantsev-Kraichnan \"rapid-change\" ensemble: time-decorrelated Gaussian\nvelocity field with the power-like spectrum k^{-d-\\xi}. Effects of\ncompressibility of the fluid are studied. It is shown that, depending on the\nrelation between the exponent \\xi and the spatial dimension d, the both systems\nexhibit four different types of critical behaviour, associated with four\npossible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. The most\ninteresting point corresponds to a new type of critical behaviour, in which the\nnonlinearity and turbulent mixing are both relevant, and the critical exponents\ndepend on d, \\xi and the degree of compressibility. For the both models,\ncompressibility enhances the role of the nonlinear terms in the dynamical\nequations: the region in the d-\\xi plane, where the new nontrivial regime is\nstable, is getting much wider as the degree of compressibility increases. In\nits turn, turbulent transfer becomes more efficient due to combined effects of\nthe mixing and the nonlinear terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 05:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-22"}

Since it is difficult to detect SNe for long GRBs at\nhigh redshift, the absence of an SN association cannot be regarded as the solid\ncriterion for a new classification of long GRBs similar to GRB 060614, called\nGRB 060614-type bursts. Fortunately, we now know that there is an obvious\nperiodic substructure observed in the prompt light curve of GRB 060614. We thus\nuse such periodic substructure as a potential criterion to categorize some long\nGRBs into a new class of bursts, which might have been fueled by an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) gulping a star, rather than a massive star\ncollapsing to form a black hole. Therefore, the second criterion to recognize\nfor this new class of bursts is whether they fit the tidal disruption model.\nFrom a total of 328 Swift GRBs with accurately measured durations and without\nSN association, we find 25 GRBs satisfying the criteria for GRB 060614-type\nbursts: seven of them are with known redshifts and 18 with unknown redshifts.\nThese new bursts are ~6% of the total Swift GRBs, which are clustered into two\nsubclasses: Type I and Type II with considerably different viscous parameters\nof accretion disks formed by tidally disrupting their different progenitor\nstars.

However, no extensive analysis has\ncompared the effects of TEs on the transcriptomes of mammalian, non-mammalian\nvertebrates and invertebrates. Results: We analyzed the influence of TEs on the\ntranscriptomes of five species, three invertebrates and two non-mammalian\nvertebrates. Compared to previously analyzed mammals, there were lower levels\nof TE introduction into introns, significantly lower numbers of exonizations\noriginating from TEs and a lower percentage of TE insertion within the first\nand last exons. Although the transcriptomes of vertebrates exhibit a\nsignificant level of exonizations of TEs, only anecdotal cases were found in\ninvertebrates. In vertebrates, as in mammals, the exonized TEs are mostly\nalternatively spliced, indicating selective pressure maintains the original\nmRNA product generated from such genes. Conclusions: Exonization of TEs is\nwide-spread in mammals, less so in non- mammalian vertebrates, and very low in\ninvertebrates. We assume that the exonization process depends on the length of\nintrons. Vertebrates, unlike invertebrates, are characterized by long introns\nand short internal exons. Our results suggest that there is a direct link\nbetween the length of introns and exonization of TEs and that this process\nbecame more prevalent following the appearance of mammals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 09:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-17"}

Here we show that exonization of\ntransposed elements is biased towards the beginning of the coding sequence in\nboth human and mouse genes. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\nrevealed that exonization of transposed elements can be population-specific,\nimplying that exonizations may enhance divergence and lead to speciation.

We\nhave developed a new numerical model to calculate the collisional evolution of\nthe gravitationally-enhanced growth stage. We validate our approach against\nexisting N-body and statistical codes. Using the numerical model, we explore\nthe characteristics of the runaway growth and the oligarchic growth accretion\nphases starting from an initial population of single planetesimal radius R_0.\nIn models where the initial random velocity dispersion (as derived from their\neccentricity) starts out below the escape speed of the planetesimal bodies, the\nsystem experiences runaway growth. We find that during the runaway growth phase\nthe size distribution remains continuous but evolves into a power-law at the\nhigh mass end, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, we find that the\nlargest body accretes from all mass bins; a simple two component approximation\nis inapplicable during this stage. However, with growth the runaway body stirs\nup the random motions of the planetesimal population from which it is\naccreting. Ultimately, this feedback stops the fast growth and the system\npasses into oligarchy, where competitor bodies from neighboring zones catch up\nin terms of mass. Compared to previous estimates, we find that the system\nleaves the runaway growth phase at a somewhat larger radius. Furthermore, we\nassess the relevance of small, single-size fragments on the growth process. In\nclassical models, where the initial velocity dispersion of bodies is small,\nthese do not play a critical role during the runaway growth; however, in models\nthat are characterized by large initial relative velocities due to external\nstirring of their random motions, a situation can emerge where fragments\ndominate the accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 11:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required. To\nbuild them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational\nbackreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral. The self-force approach\ndescribes the inspiral as the action of a local force that can be obtained from\nthe regularization of the perturbations created by the stellar compact object\non the massive black hole geometry. In this paper we extend a new time-domain\ntechnique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the\ncase of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole. The main idea behind\nour scheme is to use a multidomain framework in which the small compact object,\ndescribed as a particle, is located at the interface between two subdomains.\nThen, the equations at each subdomain are homogeneous wave-type equations,\nwithout distributional sources. In this particle-without-particle formulation,\nthe solution of the equations is smooth enough to provide good convergence\nproperties for the numerical computations. This formulation is implemented by\nusing a pseudospectral collocation method for the spatial discretization,\ncombined with a Runge Kutta algorithm for the time evolution. We present\nresults from several simulations of eccentric orbits in the case of a scalar\ncharged particle around a Schwarzschild black hole.

Two\ntypes of massive star cluster precursors, the so-called Massive Dense Cores\n(MDCs), have been observed, which differ in their mid-infrared brightness. The\norigin of this difference is not established and could be the result of\nevolution, density, geometry differences, or a combination of these. We compare\nseveral molecular tracers of physical conditions (hot cores, shocks) observed\nin a sample of mid-IR weak emitting MDCs with previous results obtained in a\nsample of exclusively mid-IR bright MDCs. The aim is to understand the\ndifferences between these two types of object. We present single-dish\nobservations of HDO, H2O-18, SO2 and CH3OH lines at lambda = 1.3 - 3.5 mm. We\nstudy line profiles and estimate abundances of these molecules, and use a\npartial correlation method to search for trends in the results. The detection\nrates of thermal emission lines are found to be very similar between mid-IR\nquiet and bright objects. The abundances of H2O, HDO (1E-13 to 1E-9 in the cold\nouter envelopes), SO2 and CH3OH differ from source to source but independently\nof their mid-IR flux. In contrast, the methanol class I maser emission, a\ntracer of outflow shocks, is found to be strongly anti-correlated with the 12\nmicron source brightnesses. The enhancement of the methanol maser emission in\nmid-IR quiet MDCs may indicate a more embedded nature. Since total masses are\nsimilar between the two samples, we suggest that the matter distribution is\nspherical around mid-IR quiet sources but flattened around mid-IR bright ones.\nIn contrast, water emission is associated with objects containing a hot\nmolecular core, irrespective of their mid-IR brightness. These results indicate\nthat the mid-IR brightness of MDCs is an indicator of their evolutionary stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 14:33:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 12:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Lui et al. (2008) proposed a CD scenario in which the kinetic\nscale linear modes grow and reach the typical dipolarization scales through an\ninverse cascade. The experimental verification of the inverse nonlinear cascade\nis based on wavelet analysis. In this paper the Hilbert-Huang transform is used\nwhich is suitable for nonlinear systems and allows to reconstruct the\ntime-frequency representation of empirical decomposed modes in an adaptive\nmanner. It was found that, in the Lui et al. (2008) event, the modes evolve\nglobally from high-frequencies to low-frequencies. However, there are also\nlocal frequency evolution trends oriented towards high-frequencies, indicating\nthat the underlying processes involve multi-scale physics and non-stationary\nfluctuations for which the simple inverse cascade scenario is not correct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 15:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-17"}

We have started a study of the metal distribution in these objects\nfrom the sample of Baumgartner et al. (2005), aiming at resolving spatially the\nmetal content of the ICM. We report here on a 42ks XMM observation of the first\nobject of the sample, the cluster Abell 2028. The XMM observation reveals a\ncomplex structure of the cluster over scale of 300 kpc, showing an interaction\nbetween two sub-clusters in cometary-like configurations. At the leading edges\nof the two substructures cold fronts have been detected. The core of the main\nsubcluster is likely hosting a cool corona. We show that a one-component fit\nfor this region returns a biased high metallicity. This inverse iron bias is\ndue to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the Fe-L complex. In\npresence of a multi-temperature structure of the ICM, the best-fit metallicity\nis artificially higher when the projected spectrum is modeled with a single\ntemperature component and it is not related to the presence of both Fe-L and\nFe-K emission lines in the spectrum. After accounting for the bias, the overall\nabundance of the cluster is consistent with the one typical of hotter, more\nmassive clusters. We caution the interpretation of high abundances inferred\nwhen fitting a single thermal component to spectra derived from relatively\nlarge apertures in 3-4 keV clusters, because the inverse iron bias can be\npresent. Most of the inferences trying to relate high abundances in 3-4 keV\nclusters to fundamental physical processes will likely have to be revised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 15:58:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 16:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}
