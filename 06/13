We\nhave designed a new analysis approach comparing the observed color-magnitude\ndiagrams with theoretical best-fit color-magnitude diagrams derived from\nprecise estimates of the star formation histories of each galaxy. This analysis\nis based on studying the difference between the V-magnitude of the RGB bump and\nthe horizontal branch at the level of the RR Lyrae instability strip\n(Delta_vhbb) and we discuss here a technique for reliably measuring this\nquantity in complex stellar systems. By using this approach, we find that the\ndifference between the observed and predicted values of Delta_vhbb is +0.13 +/-\n0.14 mag. This is smaller, by about a factor of two, than the well-known\ndiscrepancy between theory and observation at low metallicity commonly derived\nfor Galactic globular clusters. This result is confirmed by a comparison\nbetween the adopted theoretical framework and empirical estimates of the\nDelta_vhbb parameter for both a large database of Galactic globular clusters\nand for four other dSph galaxies for which this estimate is available in the\nliterature. We also investigate the strength of the red giant branch bump\nfeature (R_bump), and find very good agreement between the observed and\ntheoretically predicted R_bump values. This agreement supports the reliability\nof the evolutionary lifetimes predicted by theoretical models of the evolution\nof low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2010 16:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that this phase\ndiagram is characterized by the presence of an extended Bose glass, not\naccessible to mean-field approximation, and stemming from the localization of\ntwo distinct species of bosonic quasiparticles appearing in the ground state.\nOn the one hand, non-magnetic impurities doped into the dimer-singlet phase of\na weakly coupled dimer system are known to free up local magnetic moments. The\ndeviations of these local moments from full polarization along the field can be\nmapped onto a gas of bosonic quasiparticles, which undergo condensation in zero\nand very weak magnetic fields, corresponding to transverse long-range\nantiferromagnetic order. An increasing magnetic field lowers the density of\nsuch quasiparticles to a critical value at which a quantum phase transition\noccurs, corresponding to the quasiparticle localization on clusters of local\nmagnets (dimers, trimers, etc.) and to the onset of a Bose glass. Strong\nfinite-size quantum fluctuations hinder further depletion of quasiparticles\nfrom such clusters, and thus lead to the appearance of pseudo-plateaus in the\nmagnetization curve of the system. On the other hand, site dilution hinders the\nfield-induced Bose-Einstein condensation of triplet quasiparticles on the\nintact dimers, and it introduces instead a Bose glass of triplets. A thorough\nnumerical investigation of the phase diagram for a planar system of coupled\ndimers shows that the two above-mentioned Bose glass phases are continuously\nconnected, and they overlap in a finite region of parameter space, thus\nfeaturing a two-species Bose glass.

While unconditional path sampling of\nSDEs is straightforward, albeit expensive for high dimensional systems of SDEs,\nconditional path sampling can be difficult even for low dimensional systems.\nThis is because we need to produce sample paths of the SDE which respect both\nthe dynamics of the SDE and the initial and endpoint conditions. The dynamics\nof a SDE are governed by the deterministic term (drift) and the stochastic term\n(noise). Instead of producing conditional paths directly from the original SDE,\none can consider a sequence of SDEs with modified drifts. The modified drifts\nshould be chosen so that it is easier to produce sample paths which satisfy the\ninitial and endpoint conditions. Also, the sequence of modified drifts\nconverges to the drift of the original SDE. We construct a simple Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which samples, in sequence, conditional paths from\nthe modified SDEs, by taking the last sampled path at each level of the\nsequence as an initial condition for the sampling at the next level in the\nsequence. The algorithm can be thought of as a stochastic analog of\ndeterministic homotopy methods for solving nonlinear algebraic equations or as\na SDE generalization of simulated annealing.

This implies\nthe identity of the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan phases, which is lost for S>1.\nWe have found that new features of Berry phases emerge for integer spins>2. We\nprovide explicit numerical results of Berry phases for S=2,3,4. We give a\nprecise analysis of the non-adiabatic corrections. The accuracy for satisfying\nadiabaticity is greatly improved if one chooses for the time derivatives of the\nparameters a time-dependence having a Blackman pulse shape. This has the effect\nof taming the non-adiabatic oscillation corrections which could be generated by\na linear ramping. For realistic experimental conditions, the non-adibatic\ncorrections can be kept < 0.1%. For quantum cycles,involving as sole periodic\nparameter the precession angle of E around B, the corrections odd upon the\nreversal of the angular velocity can be cancelled exactly if the quadrupole to\ndipole coupling ratio takes a \"magic\" value. The even ones are cancelled by\nsubtraction of the phases relative to opposite velocities. As a possible\napplication of the results of this paper we suggest a route to holonomic\nentanglement of N non-correlated 1/2-spins by performing adiabatic cycles\ngoverned by a Hamiltonian which is a non-linear function of the total spin\noperator S defined as the sum of the N spin operators. The case N=4 and Sz=1 is\ntreated explicitly and maximum entanglement is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 11:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 12:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 10:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 17:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The impact\nof several effects contributing to the systematic uncertainty of luminosity\nmeasurement is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 15:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

Our system is a microfabricated quarter-wave\ncoplanar waveguide cavity. The electrical length of the cavity is varied using\nthe tunable inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device. It is\nmeasured in the quantum regime, where the temperature is significantly less\nthan the resonance frequency (~ 5 GHz). When the length is modulated at\napproximately twice the static resonance frequency, spontaneous oscillations of\nthe cavity field are observed. Time-resolved measurements of the dynamical\nstate of the cavity show multiple stable states. The behavior is well described\nby theory. Connections to the dynamical Casimir effect are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 15:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-13"}

This criterion is\nvery useful for obtaining the weak convergence for a sequence of nonlinear\nexpectations, which is a equivalent to the so-called convergence in\ndistribution, or in law for a sequence of random variables in a nonlinear\nexpectation space. We use the above result to give a new proof to the central\nlimit theorem under a sublinear expectation space. The method can be also\napplied to prove the convergence of some numerical schemes for degenerate fully\nnonlinear PDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 15:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}

The phase transition in the\nsystem with well-established properties is taken as a reference process to\nsearch for the parameters of phase transition in the perturbed equilibrium\nsystem. The main equation, derived in the framework of both classical\nthermodynamics and statistical mechanics, establishes a correlation between\nvariations of enthalpies of evaporation, \\Delta (\\Delta H), which is induced by\nperturbations, and the equilibrium vapor pressures. The dissolution of a\nsolute, changing the surface shape, and the effect of the external field of\nadsorbents are considered as the perturbing actions on the liquid phase. The\nmodel provides the unified method for studying (1) solutions, (2) membrane\nseparations (3) surface phenomena, and (4) effect of the adsorption field; it\nleads to the useful relations between \\Delta (\\Delta H), on the one hand, and\nthe osmotic pressures, the Donnan potential, the surface curvature, and the\npore structure, on the other hand. The value of \\Delta(\\Delta H) has a clear\nphysical meaning and gives a new insight into our understanding of the\napparently different phenomena. The model is applicable if the change between\nentropies of the comparable gas phases is far more than the difference between\nentropies of the liquid phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2010 15:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}
