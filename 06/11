Considering the many-body\nscreening of dipolar interactions at intermediate and larger filling factors,\nwe show that several superfluid phases with distinct pairing symmetries\nnaturally arise in the singlet channel: local s-wave $(sl)$, extended s-wave\n$(se)$, d-wave $(d)$ or time-reversal-symmetry breaking $(sl + se \\pm\nid)$-wave. We obtain the temperature versus filling factor phase diagram and\nshow that d-wave pairing is favored near half-filling, that $(sl + se)$-wave is\nfavored near zero or full filling, and that time-reversal-breaking $(sl + se\n\\pm id)$-wave is favored in between. The inclusion of a harmonic trap reveals\nthat a sequence of phases can coexist in the cloud depending on the filling\nfactor at the center of the trap.

These differences may be associated\nto the central engine and/or the external medium. Aims: The AGN classification\nFRI and FRII can be linked to the rate of electromagnetic Poynting flux\nextraction from the inner corona of the central engine by the jet. The\ncollimation results from the distribution of the total electromagnetic energy\nacross the jet, as compared to the corresponding distribution of the thermal\nand gravitational energies. We use exact solutions of the fully relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) equations obtained by a nonlinear separation of\nthe variables to study outflows from a Schwarzschild black hole corona. A\nstrong correlation is found between the jet features and the energetic\ndistribution of the plasma of the inner corona which may be related to the\nefficiency of the magnetic rotator. It is shown that observations of FRI and\nFRII jets may be partially constrained by our model for spine jets. The\ndeceleration observed in FRI jets may be associated with a low magnetic\nefficiency of the central magnetic rotator and an important thermal confinement\nby the hot surrounding medium. Conversely, the strongly collimated and\naccelerated FRII outflows may be self collimated by their own magnetic field\nbecause of the high efficiency of the central magnetic rotator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 16:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

For those theories with a\nTeV-scale WIMP annihilating through a light force-carrier, the associated\nSommerfeld enhancement provides a natural explanation of the large boost factor\nneeded to explain the signals, and the light force-carrier naturally gives rise\nto hard cosmic ray spectra without excess pi0 gamma rays or anti-protons. The\nSommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation rate, which at low relative\nvelocities v scales as 1/v, relies on the comparatively low velocity dispersion\nof the dark matter particles in the smooth halo. Dark matter substructures in\nwhich the velocity dispersion is smaller than in the smooth halo have even\nlarger annihilation rates. N-body simulations containing only dark matter\npredict the existence of such structures, for example subhalos and caustics,\nand the effects of these substructures on dark matter indirect detection\nsignals have been studied extensively. The addition of baryons into\ncosmological simulations of disk-dominated galaxies gives rise to an additional\nsubstructure component, a dark disk. The disk has a lower velocity dispersion\nthan the spherical halo component by a factor ~6, so the contributions to dark\nmatter signals from the disk can be more significant in Sommerfeld models than\nfor WIMPs without such low-velocity enhancements.

Finally, we discuss plausible UV-completions for each type of operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 19:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 21:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

Five pulsars are associated with\nsources included in the LAT bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, PSR\nJ1413-6205, is clearly associated with an EGRET source.

While these z~2 sources were drawn from deep Chandra fields\nwith >200 ks X-ray coverage, only 7 are formally detected in the X-ray and four\nlack X-ray emission at even the 2 sigma level.

We show that this is not true. We find that a small oscillating\nperturbation in the inflaton potential in the slow-roll regime can alter\nsignificantly the predicted number of small halos. A class of models derived\nfrom supergravity theories gives rise to inflaton potentials with a large\nnumber of steps and many transplanckian effects may generate oscillations in\nthe primordial power spectrum. The potentials we study are the simple quadratic\n(chaotic inflation) potential with superimposed small oscillations for small\nfield values. Without leaving the slow-roll regime, we find that for a wide\nchoice of parameters, the predicted number of halos change appreciably. For the\noscillations beginning in the 10^7-10^8 solar masses range, for example, we\nfind that only a 5% change in the amplitude of the chaotic potential causes a\n50% suppression of the number of halos for masses between 10^7-10^8 solar\nmasses and an increase in the number of halos for masses <10^6 solar masses by\nfactors ~15-50.

In the latter case this is due\nto Photospheric Radius Expansion (PRE): when the flux reaches the Eddington\nlimit, the photosphere expands and cools so that emission becomes softer and\ndrops temporarily out of the X-ray band, re-appearing as the photosphere\nsettles back down. We consider the factors necessary to generate double-peaked\nPRE events, and show that such a mechanism could plausibly operate in magnetar\nbursts, despite the vastly different emission process. Identification of the\nmagnetic Eddington limit in a magnetar would constrain magnetic field and\ndistance and could, in principle, enable a measurement of gravitational\nredshift. It would also locate the emitting region at the neutron star surface,\nconstraining the burst trigger mechanism. Conclusive confirmation of PRE events\nwill require more detailed radiative models for bursts.

There are,\nhowever, relatively few studies of large samples of LIRGs and ULIRGs using\nintegral field spectroscopy (IFS). We analyze optical (3800-7200A) IFS data\ntaken with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS) of the central\nfew kiloparsecs of 11 LIRGs. To study the stellar populations we fit the\noptical stellar continuum and the hydrogen recombination lines of selected\nregions. We analyze the excitation conditions of the gas using the spatially\nresolved properties of the brightest optical emission lines. The optical\ncontinua of the selected regions are well fitted with a combination of evolved\n(~0.7-10Gyr) and ionizing (1-20Myr) stellar populations. The latter is more\nobscured than the evolved population, and has visual extinctions in good\nagreement with those obtained from the Balmer decrement. Except for NGC 7771,\nthere is no clear evidence for an important contribution to the optical light\nfrom an intermediate-aged population (~100-500Myr). Even after correcting for\nthe presence of stellar absorption, a large fraction of spaxels with low\nobserved equivalent widths of Halpha in emission still show enhanced\n[NII]/Halpha and [SII]/Halpha ratios. These ratios are likely to be produced by\na combination of photoionization in HII regions and diffuse emission. These\nregions of enhanced ratios are generally coincident with low surface brightness\nHII regions and diffuse emission detected in the Halpha and Pa-alpha images.\nUsing the PMAS line ratios and the NICMOS Pa-alpha photometry of HII regions we\nfind that the fraction of diffuse emission in LIRGs varies from galaxy to\ngalaxy, and it is generally less than 60% as found in other starburst galaxies.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 07:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We employ a new algorithm to\neliminate the inclination and the distance selection effects in the known TNO\npopulations to derive expected parameters of the \"true\" EKB. Its estimated mass\nis M_EKB=0.12 M_earth, which is by a factor of \\sim 15 larger than the mass of\nthe EKB objects detected so far. About a half of the total EKB mass is in\nclassical and resonant objects and another half is in scattered ones. Treating\nthe debiased populations of EKB objects as dust parent bodies, we then\n\"generate\" their dust disk with our collisional code. Apart from accurate\nhandling of collisions and direct radiation pressure, we include the\nPoynting-Robertson (P-R) drag, which cannot be ignored for the EKB dust disk.\nOutside the classical EKB, the radial profile of the optical depth\napproximately follows tau \\sim r^-2 which is roughly intermediate between the\nslope predicted analytically for collision-dominated (r^-1.5) and\ntransport-dominated (r^-2.5) disks. The cross section-dominating grain size\nstill lies just above the blowout size (\\sim 1...2 \\microm), as it would\nwithout the P-R transport. However, if the EKB were by one order of magnitude\nless massive, the optical depth profile would fall off as tau \\sim r^-3, and\nthe cross section-dominating grain size would shift from \\sim 1...2\\microm to\n~100 \\microm. These properties are seen if dust is assumed to be generated only\nby known TNOs. If the solar system were observed from outside, the thermal\nemission flux from the EKB dust would be about two orders of magnitude lower\nthan for solar-type stars with the brightest known infrared excesses observed\nfrom the same distance.

Some of\nthese sets of regions, interpreted as functional networks, have recently been\nused to provide markers of brain diseases and open the road to paradigm-free\npopulation comparisons. Such group studies raise the question of modeling\nsubject variability within ICA: how can the patterns representative of a group\nbe modeled and estimated via ICA for reliable inter-group comparisons? In this\npaper, we propose a hierarchical model for patterns in multi-subject fMRI\ndatasets, akin to mixed-effect group models used in linear-model-based\nanalysis.

Recent results show that\nthe size evolution at z<1 is limited to less than 40%, while most of the\nevolution occurs at z>1, where both compact and already extended galaxies are\nobserved and the scatter in size is remarkably larger than locally. The\npresence at high z of a significant number of ETGs with the same size as their\nlocal counterparts as well as of ETGs with quite small size, points to a\ntimescale to reach the new, expanded equilibrium configuration of less than the\nHubble time. We demonstrate that the projected mass of compact, high-z galaxies\nand that of local ETGs within the *same physical radius*, the nominal\nhalf-luminosity radius of high-z ETGs, differ substantially, in that the high-z\nETGs are on the average significantly denser.

An important ingredient of the analysis of such networks is a\nproper comparison of their observed architecture against an ensemble of\nrandomized graphs, thereby quantifying the {\\em randomness} of the real systems\nwith respect to suitable null models. This approximation is particularly\nrelevant when the finite size and/or large connectivity of real systems make\ninadequate a comparison with the predictions obtained from the so-called {\\em\nconfiguration model}. In this paper we analyze four methods of DAG\nrandomization as defined by the desired combination of topological invariants\n(directed and undirected degree sequence and component distributions) aimed to\nbe preserved. A highly ordered DAG, called \\textit{snake}-graph and a\nErd\\:os-R\\'enyi DAG were used to validate the performance of the algorithms.\nFinally, three real case studies, namely, the \\textit{C. elegans} cell lineage\nnetwork, a PhD student-advisor network and the Milgram's citation network were\nanalyzed using each randomization method. Results show how the interpretation\nof degree-degree relations in DAGs respect to their randomized ensembles depend\non the topological invariants imposed. In general, real DAGs provide disordered\nvalues, lower than the expected by chance when the directedness of the links is\nnot preserved in the randomization process. Conversely, if the direction of the\nlinks is conserved throughout the randomization process, disorder indicators\nare close to the obtained from the null-model ensemble, although some\ndeviations are observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 13:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

When a\ngravitating body is surrounded by a plasma, the lensing angle depends on the\nfrequency of the electromagnetic wave, due to dispersion properties of plasma,\nin presence of a plasma inhomogeneity, and of a gravity. The second effect\nleads, even in a uniform plasma, to a difference of the gravitational photon\ndeflection angle from the vacuum case, and to its dependence on the photon\nfrequency. We take into account both effects, and derive the expression for the\nlensing angle in the case of a strongly nonuniform plasma in presence of the\ngravitation. Dependence of the lensing angle on the photon frequency in a\nhomogeneous plasma resembles the properties of a refractive prism spectrometer,\nwhich strongest action is for very long radiowaves. We discuss the\nobservational appearances of this effect for the gravitational lens with a\nSchwarzschild metric, surrounded by a uniform plasma.

The gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters hosting active\ngalaxies is a complex combination of diffuse and point-like emission with\ndifferent spectral and spatial properties. We discuss the case of the Perseus\ncluster containing the radio-galaxy NGC 1275 that has been detected as a bright\ngamma-ray source by the Fermi-LAT experiment. We provide a detailed study of\nthe gamma-ray emission coming from the core of Perseus by modeling the central\nAGN emission with a multiple plasma blob model, and the emission from the\ncluster atmosphere with both a Warming Ray (WR) model and Dark Matter (DM)\nneutralino annihilation models. We set constraints on both the central galaxy\nand cluster SED models by using multi-frequency data including the observations\nobtained by Fermi and MAGIC. We find that: i) in all the viable models for the\ncluster gamma-ray emission, the emission detected by Fermi from the Perseus\ncore is dominated by the active galaxy NGC 1275, that is found in a\nhigh-emission state; ii) the diffuse gamma-ray emission of the cluster, in the\nWR model and in the DM models with the highest allowed normalization, could be\ndetected by Fermi if the central emission from NGC1275 is in a low-emission\nstate; iii) Fermi can have the possibility to resolve and detect the diffuse\ngamma-ray flux coming from the outer corona of the Perseus atmosphere at r> 800\nkpc. Our results show that a simultaneous study of the various emission\nmechanisms that produce diffuse gamma-rays from galaxy clusters and those\nproducing gamma-rays from active galaxies residing in the cluster atmospheres\nis crucial first to disentangle the spectral and spatial characteristics of the\ngamma-ray emission and secondly to assess the optimal observational strategy in\nthe attempt to reveal the still elusive diffuse gamma-ray emission widely\npredicted for the atmospheres of large-scale structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 15:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

As a by-product, we obtain a series\nexpansions for the finite-time absolute ruin probability. On the way, we also\nderive, for the aforementioned risk process, the Laplace transform of the\nfirst-exit time from an interval from above. Finally, we illustrate our results\nby detailing some examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 09:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-15"}
