Indeed, in contrast with what\nhappens when studying galaxies, in globular clusters a systematic deviation of\nthe velocity dispersion profile from the expected Keplerian falloff would\nprovide indication of a breakdown of Newtonian dynamics rather than the\nexistence of dark matter. We perform a detailed analysis of the velocity\ndispersion in the globular cluster omega Centauri in order to investigate\nwhether it does decrease monotonically with distance as recently claimed by\nSollima et al. (2009), or whether it converges toward a constant value as\nclaimed by Scarpa Marconi and Gilmozzi (2003B). We combine measurements from\nthese two works to almost double the data available at large radii, in this way\nobtaining an improved determination of the velocity dispersion profile in the\nlow acceleration regime. We found the inner region of omega Centauri is clearly\nrotating, while the rotational velocity tend to vanish, and is consistent with\nno rotation at all, in the external regions. The cluster velocity dispersion at\nlarge radii from the center is found to be sensibly constant. The main\nconclusion of this work is that strong similarities are emerging between\nglobular clusters and elliptical galaxies, for in both classes of objects the\nvelocity dispersion tends to remain constant at large radii. In the case of\ngalaxies, this is ascribed to the presence of a massive halo of dark matter,\nsomething physically unlikely in the case of globular clusters. Such\nsimilarity, if confirmed, is best explained by a breakdown of Newtonian\ndynamics below a critical acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2010 16:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

From bisectors in\nthe Fe I 630.15 nm line we find that the magnitude of the upflows varies with\nheight with the strongest upflows being deeper in the atmosphere.

In flows driven by a fixed pressure gradient, a positive net efficiency\nas large as 25 % relative to the uncontrolled turbulent flow can be achieved\nwith downstream waves.

We have considered a sample of\nabout 1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of 726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe\nIbc, and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates. We study the trend of the rates as\na function of a few quantities available for our galaxy sample, such as\nluminosity in the B and K bands, stellar mass, and morphological class. We\ndiscuss different choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions,\ninclination correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their\nuncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published measurements\nshows that they are consistent with each other to within uncertainties when the\nrate calculations are done in the same manner. Nevertheless, our data\ndemonstrate that the rates cannot be adequately described by a single parameter\nusing either galaxy Hubble types or B - K colours. A secondary parameter in\ngalaxy \"size\", expressed by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately\ndescribe the rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes\nhave higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the SN\nrates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are discussed. We\nexamine possible causes for the rate-size relation. Physically, such a relation\nfor the core-collapse SNe is probably linked to the correlation between the\nspecific star-formation rate and the galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether\nthe same link can be established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component\n(\"tardy\" and \"prompt\") model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in\nyoung stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the\ncore-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric and Milky Way rates ...

The mean R_D is\nconsistent with previous results in isolated starless and protostellar cores.\nThe column density distributions of both H2D+ and N2D+ show no correlation with\ntotal H2 column density.

Such a surface should\nexist even for weak magnetic fields because the advection velocity decreases to\nzero at the center of the collapsing core. In this decelerated flow, Alfven\nwaves created by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection\naccumulate and amplify while approaching the Alfven surface. We study this\namplification using one dimensional MHD simulations with explicit physical\ndissipation. In the linear regime, the amplification continues until the Alfven\nwavelength becomes as small as the dissipative scale. A pressure feedback that\nincreases the pressure in the upstream flow is created via a non linear\ncoupling. We derive analytic formulae for the maximum amplification and the non\nlinear coupling and check them with numerical simulations to a very good\naccuracy. We also characterize the non linear saturation of this amplification\nwhen compression effects become important, leading to either a change of the\nvelocity gradient, or a steepening of the Alfven wave. Applying these results\nto core collapse supernovae shows that the amplification can be fast enough to\naffect the dynamics, if the magnetic field is strong enough for the Alfven\nsurface to lie in the region of strong velocity gradient just above the\nneutrinosphere. This requires the presence of a strong magnetic field in the\nprogenitor star, which would correspond to the formation of a magnetar under\nthe assumption of magnetic flux conservation. An extrapolation of our analytic\nformula (taking into account the nonlinear saturation) suggests that the Alfven\nwave could reach an amplitude of B ~ 10^15 G, and that the pressure feedback\ncould significantly contribute to the pressure below the shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 06:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 16:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to\ntheir stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense)\nirradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive\nloss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help\nunderstanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in\nexoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the\ndeep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed\nopacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a\nsignificant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical\napproach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to\nderive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for\nplane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic\nheat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as\na function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is\nshown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more\nsophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It\nnaturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the\nopacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I\nfurther show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T^4) is conserved\nin the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This\nimplies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as\nouter boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models\npertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant\nto the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day\nmodels yield deep temperatures that are ~1000K too cold to explain the present\nsize of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible\nopacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction\nsufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not\nconserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of\nnon-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night\nside or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep\nlevels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the\ninflated sizes of giant exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 07:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

The ionisation level in the disc is the key element in\ndetermining the existence and the location of the dead zone. This has been\nstudied either within the Standard Accretion Disc (SAD) framework or using\nparametric discs. In this paper, we extend this study to the case of Jet\nEmitting Discs (JED), the structure of which strongly differ from SADs because\nof the new energy balance and angular momentum extraction imposed by the jets.\nWe make use of the (r,z) density distributions provided by self-similar\naccretion-ejection models, along with the JED thermal structure derived in a\nprevious paper, to create maps of the ionisation structure of JEDs. We compare\nthe ionisation rates we obtain to the critical value required to trigger the\nmagneto-rotational instability. It is found that JEDs have a much higher\nionisation degree than SADs which renders very unlikely the presence of a dead\nzone in these discs. As JEDs are believed to occupy the inner regions of\naccretion discs, the extension of the dead zones published in the literature\nshould be re-considered for systems in which a jet is present. Moreover, since\nJEDs require large scale magnetic fields close to equipartition, our findings\nraise again the question of magnetic field advection in circumstellar accretion\ndiscs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 08:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We compare to lower resolution\nmodels, where the multiphase ISM is not resolved and is modeled as a relatively\nhomogeneous and stable medium. While merger-driven bursts of star formation are\ngenerally attributed to large-scale gas inflows towards the nuclear regions, we\nshow that once a realistic ISM is resolved, the dominant process is actually\ngas fragmentation into massive and dense clouds and rapid star formation\ntherein. As a consequence, star formation is more efficient by a factor of up\nto 10 and is also somewhat more extended, while the gas density probability\ndistribution function (PDF) rapidly evolves towards very high densities.

Some phases are\ndispersion-dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form of\nvelocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger models\nusing a thermally stabilized gas. These mergers can reach very high star\nformation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent with\nSubMillimeter Galaxies.

Proof theoretically, this extension is obtained\nsimply by extending an existing sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic\nwith typical inference rules for the modalities used in display logics. As it\nturns out, the resulting calculus, LBiKt, seems to be more basic than most\nintuitionistic tense or modal logics considered in the literature, in\nparticular, those studied by Ewald and Simpson, as it does not assume any a\npriori relationship between the diamond and the box modal operators. We recover\nEwald's intuitionistic tense logic and Simpson's intuitionistic modal logic by\nmodularly extending LBiKt with additional structural rules. The calculus LBiKt\nis formulated in a variant of display calculus, using a form of sequents called\nnested sequents. Cut elimination is proved for LBiKt, using a technique similar\nto that used in display calculi. As in display calculi, the inference rules of\nLBiKt are ``shallow'' rules, in the sense that they act on top-level formulae\nin a nested sequent. The calculus LBiKt is ill-suited for backward proof search\ndue to the presence of certain structural rules called ``display postulates''\nand the contraction rules on arbitrary structures. We show that these\nstructural rules can be made redundant in another calculus, DBiKt, which uses\ndeep inference, allowing one to apply inference rules at an arbitrary depth in\na nested sequent. We prove the equivalence between LBiKt and DBiKt and outline\na proof search strategy for DBiKt.

We performed 3D\nnumerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. In these\nsimulations of non-magnetised disks, the dead-zone is treated as a region where\nthe vertical profile of the viscosity depends on the distance from the\nequatorial plane. We consider dead-zones with vertical sizes, H_dz, ranging\nfrom 0 to H_dz=2.3H, where H is the disk scale-height. For all models, the\nvertically integrated viscous stress, and the related mass flux through the\ndisk, have the same value, such that the simulations test the dependence of\nplanetary mass accretion and migration on the vertical distribution of the\nviscous stress. For each model, an embedded 30 earth-masses planet on a fixed\ncircular orbit is allowed to accrete gas from the disk. Once the planet mass\nbecomes equal to that of Saturn or Jupiter, we allow the planet orbit to evolve\ndue to gravitational interaction with the disk. We find that the time scale\nover which a protoplanet grows to become a giant planet is essentially\nindependent of the dead-zone size, and depends only on the total rate at which\nthe disk viscously supplies material to the planet. For Saturn-mass planets,\nthe migration rate depends only weakly on the size of the dead-zone for H_dz<\n1.5H, but becomes slower when H_dz=2.3H. This effect is due to the desaturation\nof corotation torques which originate from residual material in the partial-gap\nregion. For Jupiter-mass planets, there is a clear tendency for the migration\nto proceed more slowly as the size of the dead-zone increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2010 14:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Therefore, both prolate\nand oblate models suggest that the rotation axis of the primary star is not\naligned with the Homunculus polar axis.
