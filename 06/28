A graph is a special case\nof a binary matroid, so earlier work by the authors shows inapproximability\n(subject to certain complexity assumptions) for q>2, apart from the trivial\ncase gamma=0. The situation for q=2 is different. Previous results for graphs\nimply inapproximability in the region -2<=gamma<0, apart from at two \"special\npoints\" where the polynomial can be computed exactly in polynomial time. For\nbinary matroids, we extend this result by showing (i) there is no FPRAS in the\nregion gamma<-2 unless NP=RP, and (ii) in the region gamma>0, the approximation\nproblem is hard for the complexity class #RHPi_1 under approximation-preserving\n(AP) reducibility.

The\nEBEX ground segment couples uplink and downlink hardware to a client-server\nsoftware stack, enabling real-time monitoring and command responsibility to be\ndistributed across the public internet or other standard computer networks.\nUsing the emerging dirfile standard as a uniform intermediate data format, a\nvariety of front end programs provide access to different components and views\nof the downlinked data products. This distributed architecture was demonstrated\noperating across multiple widely dispersed sites prior to and during the EBEX\nengineering flight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 02:54:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 22:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-21"}

Using a\nblend of linear and nonlinear control strategies (including feedback\nlinearization, pole placement, uncertainty estimation, and gradient-based\npotential function minimization) as well as time-scale separation in the\ndynamics, we develop a controller that is capable of maximizing the active\npower in the Maximum Power Tracking (MPT) mode, regulating the active power in\nthe Power Regulation (PR) mode, seamlessly switching between the two modes, and\nsimultaneously adjusting the reactive power to achieve a desired power factor.\nThe controller consists of four cascaded components, uses realistic feedback\nsignals, and operates without knowledge of the C_p-surface, air density,\nfriction coefficient, and wind speed. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the\ncontroller via simulation with a realistic wind profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 07:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2010 22:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-10"}

These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling\nmany recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of\nparticipants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are\nneeded that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data\nsets.\n  To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering\ntechniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between\nitems and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these\nrelationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies\nrelationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations\nbased on these relationships.\n  In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways\nto evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The\npaper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based\ntechniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was\nconducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining\nalgorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that\nmight enhance the quality of recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 07:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 07:37:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 04:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2010 07:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

In this work theoretical and numerical methods for\nconstraining the parameter space of a wide class of such models are described.\nFirst, string-theoretic models with large non-Gaussian signatures are\ninvestigated. An upper bound is placed on the amplitude of primordial\ngravitational waves produced by ultra-violet Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation. In\nall but the most finely tuned cases, this bound is incompatible with a lower\nbound derived for inflationary models which exhibit a red spectrum and\ndetectable non-Gaussianity. By analysing general non-canonical actions, a class\nof models is found which can evade the upper bound when the phase speed of\nperturbations is small. The multi-coincident brane scenario with a finite\nnumber of branes is one such model. For models with a potentially observable\ngravitational wave spectrum the number of coincident branes is shown to take\nonly small values. The second method of constraining inflationary models is the\nnumerical calculation of second order perturbations for a general class of\nsingle field models. The Klein-Gordon equation at second order, written in\nterms of scalar field variations only, is numerically solved. The slow roll\nversion of the second order source term is used and the method is shown to be\nextendable to the full equation. This procedure allows the evolution of second\norder perturbations in general and the calculation of the non-Gaussianity\nparameter in cases where there is no analytical solution available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 11:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}

From X-ray spectroscopy, we estimate the masses of nearby WDs in\nmoderately-magnetized CVs, or Intermediate Polars (IPs).\n  Methods. Using the Suzaku satellite, we aquired wide-band spectra of 17 IPs,\ncovering 3-50 keV. An accretion column model of Suleimanov et al.

It describes the motion of $N$ particles moving on a\nring, coupled through an infinite-range potential. The model has a second order\nphase transition at the energy $U_c=3/4$ and its dynamics is exactly described\nby the Vlasov equation in the $N \\to \\infty$ limit. Its chaotic properties have\nbeen investigated in the past, but the determination of the scaling with $N$ of\nthe Lyapunov Spectrum (LS) of the model remains a challenging open problem. We\nhere show that the $N^{-1/3}$ scaling of the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent (MLE),\nfound in previous numerical and analytical studies, extends to the full LS; not\nonly, scaling is \"precocious\" for the LS, meaning that it becomes manifest for\na much smaller number of particles than the one needed to check the scaling for\nthe MLE. Besides that, the $N^{-1/3}$ scaling appears to be valid not only for\n$U>U_c$, as suggested by theoretical approaches based on a random matrix\napproximation, but also below a threshold energy $U_t \\approx 0.2$. Using a\nrecently proposed method (GALI) devised to rapidly check the chaotic or regular\nnature of an orbit, we find that $U_t$ is also the energy at which a sharp\ntransition from {\\it weak} to {\\it strong} chaos is present in the phase-space\nof the model.

We present evolutionary models by\nconsidering both thermohaline and rotation-induced mixing in stellar interior.\nWe discuss the effects of these processes on the chemical properties of stars\nfrom the zero age main sequence up to the end of the second dredge-up on the\nearly-AGB for intermediate-mass stars and up to the AGB tip for low-mass stars.\nModel predictions are compared to observational data for\nlithium,12C/13C,[N/C],[Na/Fe],16O/17O, and 16O/18O in Galactic open clusters\nand in field stars with well-defined evolutionary status,as well as in\nplanetary nebulae. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed\nbehaviour of 12C/13C,[N/C], and lithium in low-mass stars that are more\nluminous than the RGB bump, and its efficiency is increasing with decreasing\ninitial stellar mass. On the TP-AGB,thermohaline mixing leads to lithium\nproduction, although the 7Li yields remain negative. Although the 3He stellar\nyields are much reduced thanks to this process, we find that solar-metallicity,\nlow-mass stars remain net 3He producers. Rotation-induced mixing is found to\nchange the stellar structure so that in the mass range between \\sim 1.5 and 2.2\nMsun the thermohaline instability occurs earlier on the red giant branch than\nin non-rotating models. Finally rotation accounts for the observed star-to-star\nabundance variations at a given evolutionary status, and is necessary to\nexplain the features of CN-processed material in intermediate-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 14:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Following the\napproach by Ralko et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 117204 (2008)] for the square\nand triangular lattices, we introduce the (minimal) extension of the QDM on the\nKagome lattice to account for spontaneous creation of mobile S=1/2 spinons at\nfinite magnetic field. Modulations of the dimer density (at zero or finite\nmagnetic field) and of the local field-induced magnetization in the vicinity of\nimpurities are computed using Lanczos Exact Diagonalization techniques on small\nclusters (48 and 75 sites). The VBC is clearly revealed from its pinning by\nimpurities, while, in the dimer liquid, crystallization around impurities\ninvolves only two neighboring dimers. We also find that a next-nearest-neighbor\nferromagnetic coupling favors VBC order. Unexpectedly, a small size\nspinon-impurity bound state appears in some region of the the dimer liquid\nphase. In contrast, in the VBC phase the spinon delocalizes within a large\nregion around the impurity, revealing the weakness of the VBC confining\npotential.

A\nmodified MO representation is derived which has the advantage that all\npolynomial ambiguities are collected into the subtraction constants and have\nsimple relations to pion polarizabilities. It is obtained by treating\ndifferently the exactly known QED Born term and the other components of the\nleft-hand cut. These components are approximated by a sum over resonances. All\nresonances up to spin two and masses up to $\\simeq1.3$ GeV are included. The\ntensor contributions to the left-hand cut are found to be numerically\nimportant. We perform fits to the data imposing chiral constraints, in\nparticular, using a model independent sum rule result on the $p^6$ chiral\ncoupling $c_{34}$. Such theoretical constraints are necessary because the\nexperimental errors are dominantly systematic. Results on further $p^6$\ncouplings and pion dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities are then derived from\nthe fit. The relevance of the new data for distinguishing between two possible\nscenarios of isospin breaking in the $f_0(980)$ region is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 15:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

In URu2Si2 these\neffects begin at temperatures around 55K but they are suddenly altered by an\nunidentified electronic phase transition at To = 17.5 K. Whether this is\nconventional ordering of the k-space states, or a change in the hybridization\nof the r-space states at each U atom, is unknown. Here we use spectroscopic\nimaging scanning tunnelling microscopy (SI-STM) to image the evolution of\nURuSi2 electronic structure simultaneously in r-space and k-space. Above To,\nthe 'Fano lattice' electronic structure predicted for Kondo screening of a\nmagnetic lattice is revealed. Below To, a partial energy gap without any\nassociated density-wave signatures emerges from this Fano lattice.\nHeavy-quasiparticle interference imaging within this gap reveals its cause as\nthe rapid splitting below To of a light k-space band into two new heavy fermion\nbands. Thus, the URu2Si2 'hidden order' state emerges directly from the Fano\nlattice electronic structure and exhibits characteristics, not of a\nconventional density wave, but of sudden alterations in both the hybridization\nat each U atom and the associated heavy fermion states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 15:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}

We ask, conversely, when a\nrepresentation of the fundamental group is the holonomy of a hyperbolic\ncone-manifold structure.
