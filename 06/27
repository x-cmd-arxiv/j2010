Although these models have\nprovided us with important insights into these phenomena, there are still many\nunanswered questions regarding the mechanisms through which the movement of the\ncomplex takes place on crowded microtubules. For example (i) how does\ncargo-binding affect motor motility? and in connection with that - (ii) how\ndoes the presence of other motors (and also other cargos) on the microtubule\naffect the motility of the motor-cargo complex? We discuss these questions from\na different perspective. The movement of a cargo is conceived here as a hopping\nprocess resulting from the transference of cargo between neighboring motors. In\nthe light of this, we examine the conditions under which cargo might display\nbidirectional movement even if directed by motors of a single polarity. The\nglobal properties of the model in the long-time regime are obtained by mapping\nthe dynamics of the collection of interacting motors and cargos into an\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) which can be resolved using the\nmatrix ansatz introduced by Derrida [Derrida et al].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2010 19:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29"}

The source exhibits\ntwo distinct states: the hard state shows emission from 1 to 150 keV, while the\nsoft state is mostly confined to be $<40$ keV. We model soft-state continuum\nspectra with two thermal components, one of which is a multicolor accretion\ndisk and the other is a single-temperature blackbody to describe the boundary\nlayer, with additional weak Comptonization represented by either a simple power\nlaw or the SIMPL model by Steiner et al. The hard-state continuum spectra are\nmodeled by a single-temperature blackbody for the boundary layer plus strong\nComptonization, modeled by a cutoff power law. While we are unable to draw firm\nconclusions about the physical properties of the disk in the hard state, the\naccretion disk in the soft state appears to approximately follow $L\\propto\nT^{3.2}$. The deviation from $L\\propto T^4$, as expected from a constant inner\ndisk radius, might be caused by a luminosity-dependent spectral hardening\nfactor and/or real changes of the inner disk radius in some part of the soft\nstate. The boundary layer apparent emission area is roughly constant from the\nhard to the soft states, with a value of about 1/11 of the neutron star\nsurface. The magnetic field on the surface of the NS in 4U~1705--44 is\nestimated to be less than about $1.9\\times 10^8$ G, assuming that the disk is\ntruncated by the ISCO or by the neutron star surface. Broad relativistic Fe\nlines are detected in most spectra and are modeled with the diskline model. The\nstrength of the Fe lines is found to correlate well with the boundary layer\nemission in the soft state. In the hard state, the Fe lines are probably due to\nillumination of the accretion disk by the strong Comptonization emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2010 21:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We are mainly concerned with the `solid' phase in which\nbond orientational order but not positional order is long ranged. As the\ntemperature is lowered in the `solid' phase, the first phase transition\ninvolving the orientation or toroidal charge of the discs is into a `gauge\ntoroid' phase in which the product of a magnetic toroidal parameter and an\norientation variable (for the discs) orders but due to a local gauge symmetry\nthese variables themselves do not individually order. Finally, in the lowest\ntemperature phase the gauge symmetry is broken and toroidal order and\norientational order both develop. In the `gauge toroidal' phase time reversal\ninvariance is broken and in the lowest temperature phase inversion symmetry is\nalso broken. In none of these phases is there long range order in any Fourier\ncomponent of the average spin. A definition of the toroidal magnetic moment\n$T_i$ of the $i$th plaquette is proposed such that the magnetostatic\ninteraction between plaquettes $i$ and $j$ is proportional to $T_iT_j$.\nSymmetry considerations are used to construct the magnetoelectric free energy\nand thereby to deduce which coefficients of the linear magnetoelectric tensor\nare allowed to be nonzero.

The fraction of candidate binary\nsystems is $\\sim$10% and the pair separation histogram exhibits a bimodal\ndistribution commonly attributed to their transient nature. However, if\nprimordial pairs cannot survive for long as recognizable bound systems, how are\nthey ending up? Here, we use simulations to confirm that merging, extreme tidal\ndistortion and ionization are possible depending on the initial orbital\nelements and mass ratio of the pair. The nature of the dominant evolutionary\npath largely depends on the strength of the local tidal field. Merging is\nobserved for initially close primordial binary clusters but also for wider\npairs in nearly parabolic orbits. Its characteristic timescale depends on the\ninitial orbital semi-major axis, eccentricity, and cluster pair mass ratio,\nbecoming shorter for closer, more eccentric equal mass pairs. Shredding or\nextreme tidal distortion of the less massive cluster and subsequent separation\nis observed in all pairs with appreciably different masses. Wide pairs steadily\nevolve into the separated twins state characterized by the presence of tidal\nbridges and separations of 200-500 pc after one Galactic orbit. In the Galaxy,\nthe vast majority of observed binary candidates appear to be following this\nevolutionary path which translates into the dominant peak (25-30 pc) in the\npair separation distribution. The secondary peak at smaller separations (10-15\npc) can be explained as due to close pairs in almost circular orbits and/or\nundergoing merging. Merged clusters exhibit both peculiar radial density and\nvelocity dispersion profiles shaped by synchronization and gravogyro\ninstabilities. Both simulations and observations show that, for the range of\nparameters studied here, long term binary cluster stability in the Galactic\ndisk is unlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 11:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 16:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

The most recent attempts to establish a mass via\nobservation of absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion imply a system\nmass of no more than 20 $ M_\\odot$. Aims. To examine these conflicting data and\npresent a possible resolution of this conflict. Methods. Interpretation of data\nthrough the application of simple trigonometry to the configuration of the SS\n433 system. Results. The absorption spectra which, attributed to the atmosphere\nof the companion, yield an orbital speed of $\\sim$ 60 km s$^{-1}$ could well be\nattributable to absorption of light from the companion in material of the\ncircumbinary disk. Then the absorption spectra predict an orbital speed for the\ncircumbinary disk material of $\\sim$ 240 km s$^{-1}$, in agreement with the\nemission line data. Conclusions. If continuum light from the companion is\nabsorbed in passage through the circumbinary disk material rather than in the\natmosphere of the companion itself, the periodic Doppler shifts in the\nabsorption spectra are entirely consistent with observations of the\ncircumbinary disk and a system mass exceeding $\\sim$ 40 $M_\\odot$. The striking\nconsistency implies that the compact object is a rather massive stellar black\nhole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 14:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2010 12:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}

This leads to the appearance of an exact\n$(t - r)$ dependent case of the metric. We analyze the resulting metric in\nthree possible causal structures. In this setup, we find a zero remnant mass in\nthe long-time limit, i.e. an instable black hole remnant. We also study the\ntunneling process across the quantum horizon of such a Vaidya black hole. The\ntunneling probability including the time-dependent part is obtained by using\nthe tunneling method proposed by Parikh and Wilczek in terms of the\nnoncommutative parameter $\\sigma$. After that, we calculate the entropy\nassociated to this noncommutative black hole solution.

Special attention was given to the\nphotometric calibration, and the precision of the ground-based data is\ngenerally better than 0.01 mag.
