The L1157 outflow is driven by a\nlow-mass Class 0 protostar and is considered the prototype of the so-called\nchemically active outflows. The bright blue-shifted bow shock B1 is the ideal\nlaboratory for studying the link between the hot (around 1000-2000 K) component\ntraced by H2 IR-emission and the cold (around 10-20 K) swept-up material. The\nmain aim is to trace the warm gas chemically enriched by the passage of a shock\nand to infer the excitation conditions in L1157-B1. A total of 27 lines are\nidentified in the 555-636 GHz region, down to an average 3 sigma level of 30\nmK. The emission is dominated by CO(5-4) and H2O(110-101) transitions, as\ndiscussed by Lefloch et al. (2010). Here we report on the identification of\nlines from NH3, H2CO, CH3OH, CS, HCN, and HCO+. The comparison between the\nprofiles produced by molecules released from dust mantles (NH3, H2CO, CH3OH)\nand that of H2O is consistent with a scenario in which water is also formed in\nthe gas-phase in high-temperature regions where sputtering or grain-grain\ncollisions are not efficient.

For general cutoff\n$r_c$ the dispersion relation is shown at long wavelengths to be that of a\nlinearized Navier-Stokes fluid living on the cutoff surface. A cutoff-dependent\nline-integral formula for the diffusion constant $D(r_c)$ is derived. The\ndependence on $r_c$ is interpreted as renormalization group (RG) flow in the\nfluid.

Such a short\nquiescent period between outbursts has never been seen before from a neutron\nstar X-ray transient. X-ray pulsations at the 599 Hz spin frequency are\ndetected throughout both outbursts. For the first time, we derive a pulse phase\nmodel that connects two outbursts, providing a long baseline for spin frequency\nmeasurement. Comparison with the frequency measured during the 2004 outburst of\nthis source gives a spin-down during quiescence of -4(1)x10^-15 Hz/s,\napproximately an order of magnitude larger than the long-term spin-down\nobserved in the 401 Hz accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. If this\nspin-down is due to magnetic dipole radiation, it requires a 2x10^8 G field\nstrength, and its high spin-down luminosity may be detectable with the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope. Alternatively, this large spin-down could be produced by\ngravitational wave emission from a fractional mass quadrupole moment of Q/I =\n1x10^{-9}. The rapid succession of the outbursts also provides a unique test of\nmodels for accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries. Disk instability models\ngenerally predict that an outburst will leave the accretion disk too depleted\nto fuel a second outburst after such a brief quiescence. We suggest a\nmodification in which the outburst is shut off by the onset of a propeller\neffect before the disk is depleted.

Our model\naccounts for star formation and energy feedback (from supernovae and active\ngalactic nuclei) as well as radially dependent non-thermal pressure support due\nto random gas motions, the latter calibrated by recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We compare the model against X-ray observations of low redshift\nclusters, finding excellent agreement with observed pressure profiles. Varying\nthe levels of feedback and non-thermal pressure support can significantly\nchange both the amplitude and shape of the thermal SZ power spectrum.\nIncreasing the feedback suppresses power at small angular scales, shifting the\npeak of the power spectrum to lower ell. On the other hand, increasing the\nnon-thermal pressure support has the opposite effect, significantly reducing\npower at large angular scales. In general, including non-thermal pressure at\nthe level measured in simulations has a large effect on the power spectrum,\nreducing the amplitude by 50% at angular scales of a few arcminutes compared to\na model without a non-thermal component. Our results demonstrate that\nmeasurements of the shape of the power spectrum can reveal useful information\non important physical processes in groups and clusters, especially at\nhigh-redshift where there exists little observational data.

It has been found that main sequence turnoffs are not\nevident for the vast majority of the stellar associations in our set,\npotentially due to the overlap of isochronal tracks at the high mass end of the\nmain sequence, and the limited depth of our images at the distance of M51. In\norder to obtain ages for more of our sample, we produced model spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) to fit to the data from the GALEXEV simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) models of Bruzual and Charlot (2003). These SEDs can be used\nto determine age, size, mass, metallicity, and dust content of each association\nvia a simple chi-squared minimization to each association's B, V, and I-band\nfluxes. The derived association properties are mapped as a function of\nlocation, and recent trends in star formation history of the galaxy are\nexplored in light of these results. This work is the first phase in a program\nthat will compare these stellar systems with their environments using\nultraviolet data from GALEX and infrared data from Spitzer, and ultimately we\nplan to apply the same stellar population mapping methodology to other nearby\nface-on spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 05:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The underlying concept of coordination among nodes\nin a cooperative MANET has induced in them a vulnerability to attacks due to\nissues like lack of fixed infrastructure, dynamically changing network\ntopology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management\npoint, and lack of a clear line of defense. We propose a semi-distributed\napproach towards Reputation Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that\ncombines with the DSR routing protocol for strengthening the defense of a\nMANET. Our system inherits the features of reputation from human behavior,\nhence making the IDS socially inspired. It has a semi-distributed architecture\nas the critical observation results of the system are neither spread globally\nnor restricted locally. The system assigns maximum weightage to self\nobservation by nodes for updating any reputation values, thus avoiding the need\nof a trust relationship between nodes. Our system is also unique in the sense\nthat it features the concepts of Redemption and Fading with a robust Path\nManager and Monitor system. Simulation studies show that DSR fortified with our\nsystem outperforms normal DSR in terms of the packet delivery ratio and routing\noverhead even when up to half of nodes in the network behave as malicious.\nVarious parameters introduced such as timing window size, reputation update\nvalues, congestion parameter and other thresholds have been optimized over\nseveral simulation test runs of the system. By combining the semi-distributed\narchitecture and other design essentials like path manager, monitor module,\nredemption and fading concepts; Our system proves to be robust enough to\ncounter most common attacks in MANETs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 06:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 08:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-14"}

This together with the\nresult of Liu, Trudinger and Wang [LTW] also implies higher regularity\n(C^{1,\\alpha}/C^\\infty) of optimal maps for more smooth (C^\\alpha /C^\\infty))\ndensities. These are the first global regularity results which we are aware of\nconcerning optimal maps on non-flat Riemannian manifolds which possess some\nvanishing sectional curvatures.

It determines the observational\nappearance of accretion flows, and is also related with the evolution of black\nhole mass and spin. Previous two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of hot\naccretion flows find that the flow is convectively unstable because of its\ninward increase of entropy. As a result, the mass accretion rate decreases\ninward, i.e., only a small fraction of accretion gas can fall onto the black\nhole, while the rest circulates in the convective eddies or lost in convective\noutflows. Radiation is usually neglected in these simulations. In many cases,\nhowever, radiative cooling is important. In the regime of the luminous hot\naccretion flow (LHAF), radiative cooling is even stronger than the viscous\ndissipation. In the one dimensional case, this implies that the inward increase\nof entropy will become slower or the entropy even decreases inward in the case\nof an LHAF. We therefore expect that convective instability becomes weaker or\ncompletely disappears when radiative cooling is important. To examine the\nvalidity of this expectation, in this paper we perform two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of hot accretion flows with strong radiative\ncooling. We find that compared to the case of negligible radiation, convection\nonly becomes slightly weaker. Even an LHAF is still strongly convectively\nunstable, its radial profile of accretion rate correspondingly changes little.\nWe find the reason is that the entropy still increases inward in the\ntwo-dimensional case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 07:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 02:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-14"}

The narrow core of the K alpha line at 6.4 keV, seen\nuniversally in Seyferts, shows minimal evidence for variability and is always\nless variable than the continuum, supporting an origin in distant material such\nas the torus. At least half the observations do show evidence for variations in\nthe wider iron K-band, however, and in at least 5 cases the excess line\nvariations appear to be broad. The simplest prediction -- that the broad\nemission line is as variable as the continuum -- is generally not confirmed as\nonly two observations show this type of behaviour. In four cases, the red wing\nof the line is more variable than the power-law continuum and extends down to\nenergies of ~ 5 keV.

It is however not clear\nthat the detection used in [1] is sensitive to emitted photons and not to the\noverall electromagnetic fluctuations, which include vacuum fluctuations. We\nshow that the proof in [1] that non-symmetrized noise is detected is erroneous:\nsupposing that the detection simply takes the square of the voltage, i.e. is\nsensitive to vacuum fluctuations, leads to identical results. We demonstrate\nthat all the results can be explained in terms of usual gaussian voltage\nfluctuations instead of photon statistics. Finally, it is found in [1] that the\nphoton noise is gaussian for a tunnel junction, for which the electron counting\nstatistics is poissonian. We show that this result is beyond the experimental\nsensitivity by at least one order of magnitude, and thus is also incorrect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 09:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2010 20:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-23"}

We\nconfirm that the spectral differences observed in component D can be attributed\nto a microlensing effect lasting at least a decade. We show that microlensing\nmagnifies the continuum source in image D, leaving the emission line region\nessentially unaffected. We interpret the differences seen in the absorption\nprofiles of component D as the result of an emission line superimposed onto a\nnearly black absorption profile. We also find that the continuum source and a\npart of the broad emission line region are likely de-magnified in component C,\nwhile components A and B are not affected by microlensing. We show that\nmicrolensing of the continuum source in component D has a chromatic dependence\ncompatible with the thermal continuum emission of a standard Shakura-Sunyaev\naccretion disk. Using a simple decomposition method to separate the part of the\nline profiles affected by microlensing and coming from a compact region from\nthe part unaffected by this effect and coming from a larger region, we\ndisentangle the true absorption line profiles from the true emission line\nprofiles. The extracted emission line profiles appear double-peaked, suggesting\nthat the emission is occulted by a strong absorber, narrower in velocity than\nthe full absorption profile, and emitting little by itself. We propose that the\noutflow around H1413+117 is constituted by a high-velocity polar flow and a\ndenser, lower velocity disk seen nearly edge-on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 10:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The combined image\nusing data from all 12 ATATS epochs has RMS noise sigma = 3.94mJy / beam and\ndynamic range 180, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM.

We have applied two-dimensional homography to correct for\nsystematic positional errors in the image domain and thereby avoid\nre-processing the visibility data. Positions of bright (above 15-{\\sigma})\npoint sources, common to MRT catalogue and MRC, are used to set up an\nover-determined system to solve for the homography matrix. After correction the\nerrors are found to be within 10% of the beamwidth for these bright sources and\nthe systematics are eliminated from the images. This technique will be of\nrelevance to the new generation radio telescopes where, owing to huge data\nrates, only images after a certain integration would be recorded as opposed to\nraw visibilities. It is also interesting to note how our investigations cued to\npossible errors in the array geometry.

We use four independent methods for characterizing the sizes of\nionized regions. Three of them give us a full size distribution: the\nfriends-of-friends (FOF) method, the spherical average method (SPA) and the\npower spectrum (PS) of the ionized fraction. These latter three methods are\ncomplementary: While the FOF method captures the size distribution of the small\nscale H II regions, which contribute only a small amount to the total\nionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measure\nfor the average size of the H II regions constituting the main contribution to\nthe ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining more\ndetails on the size distribution. Our fourth method for characterizing the\nsizes of the H II regions is the average size which results if we divide the\ntotal volume of the H II regions by their total surface area, (i.e. 3V/A),\ncomputed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding Minkowski functionals of\nthe ionized fraction field. To characterize the topology of the ionized\nregions, we calculate the evolution of the Euler Characteristic. We find that\nthe evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization is\nconsistent with inside-out reionization of a Gaussian density field. We use\nthese techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on some\nbasic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibility\nof haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass for\nsources to form.

Both M81 and M101 were observed with\nthe Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) aboard AKARI in four far-infrared bands at 65,\n90, 140, and 160 um. The spectral energy distributions of the whole galaxies\nshow the presence of the cold dust component (Tc~20 K) in addition to the warm\ndust component (Tw~60 K). We deconvolved the cold and warm dust emission\ncomponents spatially by making the best use of the multi-band photometric\ncapability of the FIS. The cold and warm dust components show power-law\ncorrelations in various regions, which can be converted into the gas mass and\nthe SFR, respectively. We find a power-law correlation between the gas and SFR\nsurface densities with significant differences in the power law index N between\ngiant HII regions (N=1.0) and spiral arms (N=2.2) in M101. The power-law index\nfor spiral arms in M81 is similar (N=1.9) to that of spiral arms in M101.\nConclusions: The power-law index is not always constant within a galaxy. The\ndifference in the power-law index can be attributed to the difference in the\nstar formation processes on a kiloparsec scale. N~2 seen in the spiral arms in\nM81 and M101 supports the scenario of star formation triggered by cloud-cloud\ncollisions enhanced by spiral density wave, while N~1 derived in giant HII\nregions in M101 suggests the star formation induced by the Parker instability\ntriggered by high velocity HI gas infall.

In particular the detection of the IR source of the e-\nbeam has been observed using four pixels of the array acquiring signals\nsimultaneously with a four channels scope at 1 GHz and at 10 Gsamples/s. The\nacquisition of four pixels allowed monitoring in real time differences in the\nbunch signals in the vertical direction. A preliminary analysis of data is\npresented and discussed. In particular we will outline the correlation between\nsignals and displacements of the source occurring with bunch refilling during a\ncomplete shift of DA{\\Phi}NE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 13:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-11"}

Very recently, the re-analysis of a large number of\narchival HST data of the cluster core has been able to put into evidence the\npresence of structures in the Sub Giant Branch: it has a brighter component\nwith a spread in magnitude by $\\sim$0.06 mag and a second one, made of about\n10% of stars, a little fainter (by $\\sim$0.05 mag). These data also show that\nthe Main Sequence of the cluster has an intrinsic spread in color which, if\ninterpreted as due to a small spread in helium abundance, suggests\n$\\Delta$Y$\\sim$0.027. In this work we examine in detail whether the Horizontal\nBranch morphology and the Sub Giant structure provide further independent\nindications that a real --although very small-helium spread is present in the\ncluster. We re--analyze the HST archival data for the Horizontal Branch of 47\nTuc, obtaining a sample of $\\sim$500 stars with very small photometric errors,\nand build population synthesis based on new models to show that its particular\nmorphology can be better explained by taking into account a spread in helium\nabundance of 2% in mass. The same variation in helium is able to explain the\nspread in luminosity of the Sub Giant Branch, while a small part of the second\ngeneration is characterized by a small C+N+O increase and provides an\nexplanation for the fainter Sub Giant Branch. We conclude that three\nphotometric features concur to form the paradigm that a small but real helium\nspread is present in a cluster that has no spectacular evidence for multiple\npopulations like those shown by other massive clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 13:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 07:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

To illustrate the method, we\ntest lowest-order templates designed to distinguish highly-boosted top and\nHiggs decays from backgrounds produced by event generators.

Placing\nthese two transformations on the same ground means that all quantized field\nlike spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 spinors are functions not only of the coordinates\nbut also of the gauge field components. This change of perspective solves a\ncouple of problems occuring for higher spin fields like the loss of causality,\nbad high-energy properties and the deviation of the gyromagnetic ratio from its\nconstant value g=2 for any spin, as caused by applying the minimal coupling.\nStarting with a \"dynamical\" interaction, a non-minimal coupling can be derived\nwhich is consistent with causality, the expectation for the gyromagnetic ratio,\nand well-behaved for high energies. As a consequence, on this stage the\n(elektromagnetic) gauge field has to be considered as classical field.\nTherefore, standard quantum field theory cannot be applied.

We examine the\nrole of the total and gas-phase iron abundance in determining Fe II strength.\nUsing AGN spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the redshift\nrange of 0.2 < z < 0.35, we measure the Fe/Ne abundance of the narrow line\nregion (NLR) using the [Fe VII]/[Ne V] line intensity ratio. We find no\nsignificant difference in the abundance of Fe relative to Ne in the NLR as a\nfunction of Fe II/Hbeta. However, the N II/S II ratio increases a by a factor\nof 2 with increasing Fe II strength. This indicates a trend in N/S abundance\nratio, and by implication in the overall metallicity of the NLR gas, with\nincreasing Fe II strength. We propose that the wide range of Fe II strength in\nAGN largely results from the selective depletion of Fe into grains in the low\nionization portion of the BLR. Photoionization models show that the strength of\nthe optical Fe II lines varies almost linearly with gas-phase Fe abundance,\nwhile the ultraviolet Fe II strength varies more weakly. Interstellar depletion\nof Fe can be as large as two orders of magnitude, sufficient to explain the\nwide range of optical Fe II strength in AGN. This picture is consistent with\nthe similarity of the BLR radius to the dust sublimation radius and with\nindications of Fe II emitting gas flowing inwards from the dusty torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 14:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2010 18:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A unique element of the X-ray optical design\nof the last scheme is the monochromatization of X-rays using a single crystal\nin Bragg-transmission geometry. A great advantage of this method is that the\nmonochromator introduces no path delay of X-rays. This fact eliminates the need\nfor a long electron beam bypass, or for the creation of two precisely\nseparated, identical electron bunches, as required in the other two\nself-seeding schemes. In its simplest configuration, the self-seeded XFEL\nconsists of an input undulator and an output undulator separated by a\nmonochromator. In some experimental situations this simplest two-undulator\nconfiguration is not optimal. The obvious and technically possible extension is\nto use a setup with three or more undulators separated by monochromators. This\namplification-monochromatization cascade scheme is distinguished, in\nperformance, by a small heat-loading of crystals and a high spectral purity of\nthe output radiation. This paper describes such cascade self-seeding scheme\nwith wake monochromators.

Most of the work in this area, focuses on designing throughput\noptimal schemes for fully connected networks (no hidden nodes). But, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed schemes, though perform optimally in fully\nconnected network, achieve significantly lesser throughput even than that of\nstandard IEEE 802.11 in a network with hidden nodes. This motivates the need\nfor designing schemes that provide near optimal performance even when hidden\nnodes are present. The primary reason for the failure of existing protocols in\nthe presence of hidden nodes is that these protocols are based on the model\ndeveloped by Bianchi. However this model does not hold when hidden nodes exist.\nMoreover, analyzing networks with hidden nodes is still an open problem. Thus,\ndesigning throughput optimal schemes in networks with hidden nodes is\nparticularly challenging. The novelty of our approach is that it is not based\non any underlying mathematical model, rather it directly tunes the control\nvariables so as to maximize the throughput. We demonstrate that this model\nindependent approach achieves maximum throughput in networks with hidden\nterminals as well. Apart from this major contribution, we present stochastic\napproximation based algorithms for achieving weighted fairness in a connected\nnetworks. We also present a throughput optimal exponential backoff based random\naccess algorithm. We demonstrate that the exponential backoff based scheme may\noutperform an optimal p-persistent scheme in networks with hidden terminals.\nThis demonstrates the merit of exponential backoff based random access schemes\nwhich was deemed unnecessary by results shown by Bianchi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 14:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-11"}

The calculations are based on the\nassumption that the radius of the companion star has reached its Roche radius\n(or at 90%), but the pulsar's mass has not been assumed to be a certain value.\nOur results are as follows. The companion star should be a MS.

It is, however, possible to determine the\ninclination angle, i, between the rotation axis of a star and an observer's\nline-of-sight from measurements of the projected equatorial velocity (v sin i),\nthe stellar rotation period (P_rot) and the stellar radius (R_star). This\nallows the removal of the sin i dependency of spectroscopically derived\nextra-solar planet masses under the assumption that the planetary orbits lie\nperpendicular to the stellar rotation axis. We have carried out an extensive\nliterature search and present a catalogue of v sin i, P_rot, and R_star\nestimates for exoplanet host stars. In addition, we have used Hipparcos\nparallaxes and the Barnes-Evans relationship to further supplement the R_star\nestimates obtained from the literature. Using this catalogue, we have obtained\nsin i estimates using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis. This allows proper\n1-sigma two-tailed confidence limits to be placed on the derived sin i's along\nwith the transit probability for each planet to be determined. While a small\nproportion of systems yield sin i's significantly greater than 1, most likely\ndue to poor P_rot estimations, the large majority are acceptable. We are\nfurther encouraged by the cases where we have data on transiting systems, as\nthe technique indicates inclinations of ~90 degrees and high transit\nprobabilities. In total, we estimate the true masses of 133 extra-solar\nplanets. Of these, only 6 have revised masses that place them above the 13\nJupiter mass deuterium burning limit. Our work reveals a population of\nhigh-mass planets with low eccentricities and we speculate that these may\nrepresent the signature of different planetary formation mechanisms at work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2010 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
