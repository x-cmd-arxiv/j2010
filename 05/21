Near-UV OH lines constitute an important tool to derive oxygen\nabundances in metal-poor dwarf stars. Therefore, it is important to correctly\nmodel the line formation of OH lines, especially in metal-poor stars, where 3D\nhydrodynamical models commonly predict cooler temperatures than plane-parallel\nhydrostatic models in the upper photosphere. We have made use of a grid of 52\n3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres for dwarf stars computed using the code\nCO5BOLD, extracted from the more extended CIFIST grid. The 52 models cover the\neffective temperature range 5000-6500K, the surface gravity range 3.5-4.5 and\nthe metallicity range -3<[Fe/H]<0. We determine 3D-LTE abundance corrections in\nall the 52 3D models for several OH lines and FeI lines of different excitation\npotentials. These 3D-LTE corrections are generally negative reaching values of\nroughly -1 dex (for the OH 3167 with excitation potential of approximately 1\neV) for the higher temperatures and surface gravities. We apply these 3D-LTE\ncorrections to the individual O abundances, derived from OH lines, of a sample\nthe metal-poor dwarf stars reported in Israelian et al.(1998, 2001) and\nBoesgaard et al.(1999), by interpolating the stellar parameters of the dwarfs\nin the grid of 3D-LTE corrections.

While there\nhas been a great deal of work on simulation tools from the high-performance\ncomputing community, behavioral simulations remain challenging to program and\nautomatically scale in parallel environments. In this paper we present BRACE\n(Big Red Agent-based Computation Engine), which extends the MapReduce framework\nto process these simulations efficiently across a cluster. We can leverage\nspatial locality to treat behavioral simulations as iterated spatial joins and\ngreatly reduce the communication between nodes. In our experiments we achieve\nnearly linear scale-up on several realistic simulations.\n  Though processing behavioral simulations in parallel as iterated spatial\njoins can be very efficient, it can be much simpler for the domain scientists\nto program the behavior of a single agent. Furthermore, many simulations\ninclude a considerable amount of complex computation and message passing\nbetween agents, which makes it important to optimize the performance of a\nsingle node and the communication across nodes. To address both of these\nchallenges, BRACE includes a high-level language called BRASIL (the Big Red\nAgent SImulation Language). BRASIL has object oriented features for programming\nsimulations, but can be compiled to a data-flow representation for automatic\nparallelization and optimization. We show that by using various optimization\ntechniques, we can achieve both scalability and single-node performance similar\nto that of a hand-coded simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 17:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-21"}

This source, a\nSpitzer-selected luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), is confirmed via polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph\n(IRS) and resolved with HST WFC3 imaging. In this galaxy, which with a stellar\nmass of M*=4e9 Msun is one of the two least massive ones studied with IRS at\nz>2, we also detect H_2 S(4) and H_2 S(5) pure rotational lines (at 3.1 sigma\nand 2.1 sigma) - the first detection of these molecular hydrogen lines in a\nhigh-redshift galaxy. From the molecular hydrogen lines we infer an excitation\ntemperature T=377+68-84 K. The detection of these lines indicates that the warm\nmolecular gas mass is 6(+36-4)% of the stellar mass and implies the likely\nexistence of a substantial reservoir of cold molecular gas in the galaxy.\nFuture spectral observations at longer wavelengths with facilities like the\nHerschel Space Observatory, the Large Millimeter Telescope, and the Atacama\nPathfinder EXperiment (APEX) thus hold the promise of precisely determining the\ntotal molecular gas mass. Given the redshift, and using refined astrometric\npositions from the high resolution imaging, we also update the magnification\nestimate and derived fundamental physical properties of this system. The\npreviously published values for total infrared luminosity, star formation rate,\nand dust temperature are confirmed modulo the revised magnification; however we\nfind that PAH emission is roughly a factor of five stronger than would be\npredicted by the relations between the total infrared and PAH luminosity\nreported for SMGs and starbursts in Pope et al. (2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 20:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 16:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Only one source (J033127.2-274247) is detected in the Extended Chandra\nDeep Field South (ECDF-S) X-ray data, and has been spectroscopically confirmed\nas a z = 4.48 quasar with $L_X = 4.2\\times 10^{44}$ erg/s. The single detection\ngives a Lyman-alpha quasar density consistent with the X-ray luminosity\nfunction of quasars. The coadded counts of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) in\nthe central Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) region yields a S/N=2.4 (p=99.83%)\ndetection at soft band, with an effective exposure time of ~36 Ms. Further\nanalysis of the equivalent width (EW) distribution shows that all the signal\ncomes from 12 LAE candidates with EW_rest < 400 \\AA, and 2 of them contribute\nabout half of the signal. Following-up spectroscopic observations show that the\ntwo are a low-redshift emission line galaxy and a Lyman break galaxy at z =\n4.4. Excluding these two and combined with ECDF-S data, we derive a 3-sigma\nupper limit on the average luminosity of $L_{0.5-2 keV}$ $<$ 2.4 $\\times\n10^{42}$ ergs/s for z ~ 4.5 LAEs. If the average X-ray emission is due to star\nformation, it corresponds to a star-formation rate (SFR) of < 180--530 M$_\\sun$\nper yr. We use this SFR_X as an upper limit of the unobscured SFR to constrain\nthe escape fraction of Lyman-alpha photons, and find a lower limit of f_esc >\n3-10%. However, our upper limit on the SFR_X is ~7 times larger than the upper\nlimit on SFR_X on z ~ 3.1 LAEs in the same field, and at least 30 times higher\nthan the SFR estimated from Lyman-alpha emission. From the average X-ray to\nLyman-alpha line ratio, we estimate that fewer than 3.2% (6.3%) of our LAEs\ncould be high redshift type 1 (type 2) AGNs, and those hidden AGNs likely show\nlow rest frame EWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 20:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 20:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Here\nI report an analysis of archival Spitzer Space Telescope data on ultra-luminous\ninfrared galaxies and demonstrate that star formation regions are buried inside\noptically thick clouds of gas and dust, so that dust obscuration affects\nstar-formation indicators but not molecular hydrogen.

Instead, I propose that H_2 emission in these objects traces shocks\nin the surrounding material, which are in turn excited by interactions with\nnearby galaxies, and that powerful large-scale shocks cooling by means of H_2\nemission may be much more common than previously thought. In the early\nuniverse, a boost in H_2 emission by this process may speed up the cooling of\nmatter as it collapsed to form the first stars and galaxies and would make\nthese first structures more readily observable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 20:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this model, there is a buffer with limited capacity $B$. At\nany time, the buffer cannot accommodate more than $B$ packets. Packets arrive\nover time. Each packet is associated with a non-negative value. Packets leave\nthe buffer only because they are either sent or dropped. Those packets that\nhave left the buffer will not be reconsidered for delivery any more. In each\ntime step, at most one packet in the buffer can be sent. The order in which the\npackets are sent should comply with the order of their arrival time. The\nobjective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent in an online\nmanner. In this paper, we study a variant of this FIFO buffering model in which\na packet's value is either 1 or $\\alpha > 1$. We present a deterministic\nmemoryless 1.304-competitive algorithm.

The idea used in our algorithm is novel and different from all\nprevious approaches applied for the general model and its variants.

(2009) relation to convert from 24um flux to SFR, we calculate an\nintegrated obscured SFR of 267 Msolar/yr and a specific star formation rate of\n28 Msolar/yr per 10^14 Msolar. The cluster mass normalized integrated SFR of\nthe Bullet Cluster is among the highest in a sample of eight other clusters and\ncluster mergers from the literature. Five LIRGs and one ULIRG contribute 30%\nand 40% of the total SFR of the cluster, respectively. To investigate the\norigin of the elevated specific SFR, we compare the infrared luminosity\nfunction (IR LF) of the Bullet Cluster to those of Coma (evolved to z=0.297)\nand CL1358+62. The Bullet Cluster IR LF exhibits an excess of sources compared\nto the IR LFs of the other massive clusters. A Schechter function fit of the\nBullet Cluster IR LF yields L*=44.68+/-0.11 ergs/s, which is ~0.25 and 0.35 dex\nbrighter than L* of evolved Coma and CL1358+62, respectively. The elevated IR\nLF of the Bullet Cluster relative to other clusters can be explained if we\nattribute the \"excess\" star-forming IR galaxies to a population associated with\nthe infalling group that have not yet been transformed into quiescent galaxies.\nIn this case, the timescale required for quenching star formation in the\ncluster environment must be longer than the timescale since the group's\naccretion -- a few hundred million years. We suggest that \"strangulation\" is\nlikely to be an important process in the evolution of star formation in\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 21:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 21:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

With the\nreturn of the Stardust samples from Jupiter-family comet 81P/Wild 2, this\nhypothesis can be tested.

Application of a large magnetic field\nproduces massively degenerate quantum levels known as Landau levels. Within a\nLandau level the kinetic energy of the electrons is suppressed, and\nelectron-electron interactions set the only energy scale. Coulomb interactions\nbreak the degeneracy of the Landau levels and can cause the electrons to order\ninto complex ground states. In the high energy single particle spectrum of this\nsystem, we observe salient and unexpected structure that extends across a wide\nrange of Landau level filling fractions. The structure appears only when the\n2DES is cooled to very low temperature, indicating that it arises from delicate\nground state correlations. We characterize this structure by its evolution with\nchanging electron density and applied magnetic field. We present two possible\nmodels for understanding these observations. Some of the energies of the\nfeatures agree qualitatively with what might be expected for composite\nFermions, which have proven effective for interpreting other experiments in\nthis regime. At the same time, a simple model with electrons localized on\nordered lattice sites also generates structure similar to those observed in the\nexperiment. Neither of these models alone is sufficient to explain the\nobservations across the entire range of densities measured. The discovery of\nthis unexpected prominent structure in the single particle spectrum of an\notherwise thoroughly studied system suggests that there exist core features of\nthe 2DES that have yet to be understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 03:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-24"}

A\npreliminary solution obtained using the Wilson-Devinney light curve modelling\ntechnique indicates that the star is more likely a partially-eclipsing W UMa\ntype contact binary. However, the determination of actual subtype of this\nbinary is quite impossible from the photometry alone, as the observed light\ncurve can fitted for both A- and W-type solutions. The exact classification of\nthis binary needs to be determined from high resolution spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 05:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-24"}

This is mainly due to its morphology, because the central\nOB cluster NGC 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and the\nexpanding HII-region now interacts with the cloud. Studying the spatial\ndistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites in\nRosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will help\nto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in Rosette. We use continuum\ndata obtained with the PACS (70 and 160 micron) and SPIRE instruments (250,\n350, 500 micron) of the Herschel telescope during the Science Demonstration\nPhase of HOBYS. Three-color images of Rosette impressively show how the\nmolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the NGC 2244 cluster. A\nclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (running\nfrom the HII-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.\nStudying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale\n0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) with\nincreasing distance to the cluster NGC 2244. No clear gradient is found for the\nclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. The existence of temperature and\ndensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation in\nRosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central NGC\n2244 cluster. A more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellar\npopulation in Rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 10:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Shock waves from a somewhat distant supernova, or a\nrelatively nearby AGB star, have the right speeds to simultaneously trigger the\ncollapse of a dense molecular cloud core and to inject shock wave material into\nthe resulting protostar. A new set of FLASH2.5 adaptive mesh refinement\nhydrodynamical models shows that the injection efficiency depends sensitively\non the assumed shock thickness and density. Supernova shock waves appear to be\nthin enough to inject the amount of shock wave material necessary to match the\nshort-lived radioisotope abundances measured for primitive meteorites.\nPlanetary nebula shock waves from AGB stars, however, appear to be too thick to\nachieve the required injection efficiencies. These models imply that a\nsupernova pulled the trigger that led to the formation of our solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 15:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
