Our main\nconclusion is that both direct detection experiments and particle accelerators\nmay be complemented by using the Sun as a probe for WIMP DM particles in the\n5-50 GeV mass range. The DM most sensitive to this probe has suppressed\nannihilations and a large spin-dependent elastic scattering cross section. For\nthe WIMP cross-section parameters explored here, the lightest WIMP masses <10\nGeV are ruled out by constraints on core sound speed and low-degree frequency\nspacings. For WIMP masses 30-50 GeV, the changes to the solar structure are\nconfined to the inner 4% of the solar radius and so do not significantly affect\nthe solar p-modes. Future helioseismology observations, most notably involving\ng-modes, and future solar neutrino experiments may be able to constrain the\nallowable DM parameter space in a mass range that is of current interest for\ndirect detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 16:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 17:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-08"}

Photolysis of pure\nozone destroyed O3, but a small amount of ozone remained in the film at high\nfluence. Photolysis of pure O2 produced O3 in an amount that increased with\nphoton fluence to a stationary level. For both O2 and O3 films, the O3:O2 ratio\nat saturation is 0.03, nearly 10-30 times larger than those obtained in gas\nphase photolysis. This enhancement is attributed to the increased\nphotodissociation of O2 due to photoabsorption by O2 dimers, a process\nsignificant at solid state densities. We obtain initial quantum yield for ozone\nsynthesis from solid oxygen, {\\Phi} (O3) = 0.18 and for destruction of ozone\nand oxygen in their parent solids, {\\Phi} (- O3) = 1.7 and {\\Phi} (-O2) = 0.28.\nCombined with known photoabsorption cross sections, we estimate probabilities\nfor germinate recombination of 0.15 for O3 fragments and 0.90 for oxygen atoms\nfrom O2 dissociation. Using a two-parameter kinetic model, we deduce the\naverage probabilities for the reaction of an O atom with O2 and O3 to be 0.10\nand 1, respectively. These probabilities are the same for both O2 and O3 films,\neven though the distribution of kinetic and internal energy of the\nphotofragments is very different in both cases.

The SPIRE detectors are\narrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a\nfield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.\nIts main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned\nacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if\ndesired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a\ndiameter of 2.6'. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25\nGHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating\nmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror\nto acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position\noffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve\nthe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map\nareas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold\nfocal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics\nunits, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and\ndata handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data\ncompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science\nproducts. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds\npredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer\nsensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and\nthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 17:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The goal of this research was to establish multiple linear\nregression (MLR) between weights of basis functions obtained from PCA and fewer\nanthropometric measurements in order to individualize a given listener's HRTFs\nwith his or her own anthropomety. We proposed here an improved\nindividualization method based on MLR of weights of basis functions by\nutilizing 8 chosen out of 27 anthropometric measurements. Our objective\nexperiments' results show a superior performance than that of our previous work\non individualizing minimum phase HRIRs and also better than similar research.\nThe proposed individualization method shows that the individualized magnitude\nHRTFs could approximated well the the original ones with small error.

Formulations that use a\nfoliation of spacetime to evolve a state do not have this property nor do\nhistories-based approaches.

A fragment\n(see figure on right) is a part of a circuit and may have open inputs and\noutputs.

This change in the source of the\nempirical data allows the scientific method to be applied to several aspects of\nphysical reality that previously resisted systematic interrogation. Under the\nnew method, scientific theories are compared by instantiating them as\ncompression programs, and examining the codelengths they achieve on a database\nof measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Because of the\nimpossibility of compressing random data, \"real world\" data can only be\ncompressed by discovering and exploiting the empirical structure it exhibits.\nThe method also provides a new way of thinking about two longstanding issues in\nthe philosophy of science: the problem of induction and the problem of\ndemarcation.\n  The second part of the paper proposes to reformulate computer vision as an\nempirical science of visual reality, by applying the new method to large\ndatabases of natural images. The immediate goal of the proposed reformulation\nis to repair the chronic difficulties in evaluation experienced by the field of\ncomputer vision. The reformulation should bring a wide range of benefits,\nincluding a substantially increased degree of methodological rigor, the ability\nto justify complex theories without overfitting, a scalable evaluation\nparadigm, and the potential to make systematic progress. A crucial argument is\nthat the change is not especially drastic, because most computer vision tasks\ncan be reformulated as specialized image compression techniques. Finally, a\nconcrete proposal is discussed in which a database is produced by recording\nfrom a roadside video camera, and compression is achieved by developing a\ncomputational understanding of the appearance of moving cars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 21:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-31"}

The\nderived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk\nsuperconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO\norder parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of\nCO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the\ntetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp\ndrop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling\nbelow the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the\ninterlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe\nstacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane\ncorrelations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,\nthe spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8. Truly static SO\nsets in below the CO and coincides with the first appearance of in-plane\nsuperconducting correlations at temperatures significantly above the bulk\ntransition to superconductivity (SC). Indications that bulk SC causes a\nreduction of the spin or charge stripe order could not be identified. We argue\nthat CO is the dominant order that is compatible with SC pairing but competes\nwith SC phase coherence. Comparing our results with data from the literature,\nwe find good agreement if all results are plotted as a function of x' instead\nof the nominal x, where x' represents an estimate of the actual Ba content,\nextracted from the doping dependence of the structural transition between the\northorhombic phase and the tetragonal high-temperature phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 23:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We examine the accuracy of the tree codes through\ncomparison with a direct code over a much wider range of parameter space than\nhas been feasible before.

(2) Recent Fermi-LAT observations\nsuggest that the bulk MeV-range and HE ($\\ga100$ MeV) emission may arise from\ndifferent regions. We then consider a two-zone case where HE emission is\ngenerated in much larger radii than that of the MeV-range emission. We find\nthat the HE emission may be mainly attenuated by MeV-range emission and that\nthe attenuated HE spectrum does not show an exponential spectral cutoff but a\nslight steepening. This suggests that there may be no abrupt cutoff due to\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ attenuation if relaxing the one-zone assumption. By studying the\nspectra of three bright Fermi-LAT GRBs 080916C, 090510 and 090902B, we show\nthat a bulk LF of\\textbf{ $\\Gamma\\sim600$ }can be consistent with observations\nin the two-zone case. Even lower LFs can be obtained in the multi-zone case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 07:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 2010 16:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\nflare was observed by several spaceborne instruments, namely SOHO/MDI,\nHinode/SOT, TRACE and STEREO/SECCHI. The flare was initiated near a small,\npositive-polarity, satellite sunspot at the centre of the AR, surrounded by\nopposite-polarity field regions. MDI images of the AR show considerable amount\nof changes in a small positive-polarity sunspot of delta configuration during\nthe flare event. SOT/G-band (4305 A) images of the sunspot also suggest the\nrapid evolution of the positive-polarity sunspot with highly twisted penumbral\nfilaments before the flare event, which were oriented in the counterclockwise\ndirection. It shows the change in orientation and also remarkable disappearance\nof twisted penumbral filaments (~35-40%) and enhancement in umbral area\n(~45-50%) during the decay phase of the flare. TRACE and SECCHI observations\nreveal the successive activations of two helical twisted structures associated\nwith this sunspot, and the corresponding brightening in the chromosphere as\nobserved by the time-sequence images of SOT/Ca II H line (3968 A). The\nsecondary-helical twisted structure is found to be associated with the M8.9\nflare event. The brightening starts 6-7 min prior to the flare maximum with the\nappearance of secondary helical-twisted structure. The flare intensity\nmaximizes as this structure moves away from the AR.

Current\nobservational technologies lack the resolving power to confirm the nanoflare\nhypothesis. An alternative approach is to construct a magnetohydrodynamic\ncoronal loop model that has the ability to predict nanoflare energy\ndistributions.\n  Aims: This paper presents the initial results generated by such a model. It\npredicts heating events with a range of sizes, depending on where the\ninstability threshold for linear kink modes is encountered. The aims are to\ncalculate the distribution of event energies and to investigate whether kink\ninstability can be predicted from a single parameter.\n  Methods: The loop is represented as a straight line-tied cylinder. The\ntwisting caused by random photospheric motions is captured by two parameters,\nrepresenting the ratio of current density to field strength for specific\nregions of the loop. Dissipation of the loop's magnetic energy begins during\nthe nonlinear stage of the instability, which develops as a consequence of\ncurrent sheet reconnection. After flaring, the loop evolves to the state of\nlowest energy where, in accordance with relaxation theory, the ratio of current\nto field is constant throughout the loop and helicity is conserved.\n  Results: The results suggest that instability cannot be predicted by any\nsimple twist-derived property reaching a critical value. The model is applied\nsuch that the loop undergoes repeated episodes of instability followed by\nenergy-releasing relaxation. Hence, an energy distribution of the nanoflares\nproduced is collated.\n  Conclusions: The final energy distribution features two nanoflare populations\nthat follow different power laws. The power law index for the higher energy\npopulation is more than sufficient for coronal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 09:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2010 09:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The visible\nspectrometer VEGA on the CHARA array can be an efficient means of probing the\nstructure and the kinematics of the hot circumstellar gas at sub-AU. For the\nfirst time, we observed the Herbig Ae star AB Aur in the H$\\alpha$ emission\nline, using the VEGA low spectral resolution on two baselines of the array. We\ncomputed and calibrated the spectral visibilities between 610 nm and 700 nm. To\nsimultaneously reproduce the line profile and the visibility, we used a 1-D\nradiative transfer code that calculates level populations for hydrogen atoms in\na spherical geometry and synthetic spectro-interferometric observables. We\nclearly resolved AB Aur in the H$\\alpha$ line and in a part of the continuum,\neven at the smallest baseline of 34 m. The small P-Cygni absorption feature is\nindicative of an outflow but could not be explained by a spherical stellar wind\nmodel. Instead, it favors a magneto-centrifugal X-disk or disk-wind geometry.\nThe fit of the spectral visibilities could not be accounted for by a wind\nalone, so we considered a brightness asymmetry possibly caused by large-scale\nnebulosity or by the known spiral structures, inducing a visibility modulation\naround H$\\alpha$. Thanks to the unique capabilities of VEGA, we managed to\nsimultaneously record for the first time a spectrum at a resolution of 1700 and\nspectral visibilities in the visible range on a target as faint as $m_{V}$ =\n7.1. It was possible to rule out a spherical geometry for the wind of AB Aur\nand provide realistic solutions to account for the H$\\alpha$ emission\ncompatible with magneto-centrifugal acceleration. The study illustrates the\nadvantages of optical interferometry and motivates observations of other bright\nyoung stars to shed light on the accretion/ejection processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 11:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

By\nadjusting the stagnation and ambient pressures, it has been possible to select\nthe Mach number of the jets, independently from the density ratio. Each jet is\ntherefore characterized by its maximum Mach number, ranging from 10 to 50. The\nReynolds number range of the nozzle is 1000 to 50000.

Differing approaches for fitting the Civ line can be found\nin the literature, and we compare the most common methods to highlight the\nrelative systematics associated with each. We develop a line fitting procedure\nand apply it to the Civ line in spectra from the SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys.\n  Our results are compared with a previous study of the Mgii line in the same\nsample. Civ tends to be broader than the Mgii line in spectra that have both,\nand the average ratio between the lines is consistent with a simplistic model\nfor a photoionised, virialised and stratified broad-line region. There is a\nstatistically significant correlation between the widths of the Civ and Mgii\nlines. However, the correlation is weak, and the scatter around a best fit is\nonly marginally less than the full dynamic range of line widths.\n  Motivated by previous work, we examine the dispersion in the distribution of\nCiv line widths. We find that the dispersion in Civ line widths is essentially\nindependent of both redshift and luminosity. This is in stark contrast to the\nMgii line, which shows a strong luminosity dependence.\n  Finally we consider our results in terms of their implications for virial\nblack hole mass estimation. The inconsistency between Mgii and Civ line widths\nin single spectra, combined with the differing behaviour of the Mgii and Civ\nline width distributions, indicates that there must be an inconsistency between\nMgii and Civ virial mass estimators. Furthermore, the level of intrinsic\ndispersion in Mgii and Civ line widths contributes less dynamic range to virial\nmass estimates than the error associated with the estimates. The indication is\nthat the line width term in these UV virial mass estimators may be essentially\nirrelevant with respect to the typical uncertainty on a mass estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 13:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this work, we use a set of source catalogues from\nastrophysically motivated models of massive black hole binary formation and\nassume a one year LISA mission lifetime.

The AM perturbation and modulation is a\ndirect product of the outer gas giants (Uranus & Neptune). This information\ngives the opportunity to predict future grand minima along with normal solar\ncycle strength with some confidence. A proposed mechanical link between solar\nactivity and planetary influence via a discrepancy found in solar/planet AM\nalong with current AM perturbations indicate solar cycle 24 & 25 will be\nheavily reduced in sunspot activity resembling a similar pattern to solar\ncycles 5 & 6 during the Dalton Minimum (1790-1830).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 14:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 11:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2010 23:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-11"}

The basic idea for the acceleration of radiative transfer is parallel\nto the tree algorithm that is hitherto used to speed up the gravitational force\ncalculation in an N-body system. It is demonstrated that the radiative transfer\ncalculations can be dramatically accelerated, where the computational time is\nscaled as Np log Ns for Np SPH particles and Ns radiation sources. Such\nacceleration allows us to readily include not only numerous sources but also\nscattering photons, even if the total number of radiation sources is comparable\nto that of SPH particles. Here, a test simulation is presented for a multiple\nsource problem, where the results with START are compared to those with a\nradiation SPH code without tree-based acceleration. We find that the results\nagree well with each other if we set the tolerance parameter as < 1.0, and then\nit demonstrates that START can solve radiative transfer faster without reducing\nthe accuracy. One of important applications with START is to solve the transfer\nof diffuse ionizing photons, where each SPH particle is regarded as an emitter.\nTo illustrate the competence of START, we simulate the shadowing effect by\ndense clumps around an ionizing source. As a result, it is found that the\nerosion of shadows by diffuse recombination photons can be solved.

We calculate the evolution of the\ncorrelation length and the field amplitude during the inverse cascade and\nviscous damping of the helical magnetic field in the radiation era after\ninflation. We conclude that except for low scale inflation with very strong\ncoupling, the magnetic fields generated by such an axial coupling in single\nfield slow roll inflation with perturbative coupling to the inflaton are too\nweak to provide the seeds for the observed fields in galaxies and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 15:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 16:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 15:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2011 12:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Typically the new models beyond the SM explain only one\nof these observations. Instead, in the present article, we take the view that\nthey both point towards the same new extension of the Standard Model. The new\nparticles introduced are responsible simultaneously for neutrino masses and for\nthe dark matter of the Universe. The stability of dark matter and the smallness\nof neutrino masses are guaranteed by a U(1) global symmetry, broken to a\nremnant Z_2. The canonical seesaw mechanism is forbidden and neutrino masses\nemerge at the loop level being further suppressed by the small explicit\nbreaking of the U(1) symmetry. The new particles and interactions are invoked\nat the electroweak scale and lead to rich phenomenology in colliders, in lepton\nflavour violating rare decays and in direct and indirect dark matter searches,\nmaking the model testable in the coming future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 15:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 00:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

In NGC 1333, a total of 95 cluster members are detected in X-rays,\nof which 54 were previously identified with Spitzer. Of the Spitzer sources, we\ndetect 23% of the Class I protostars, 53% of the Flat Spectrum sources, 52% of\nthe Class II, and 50% of the Transition Disk YSOs. Forty-one Class III members\nof the cluster are identified, bringing the total identified YSO population to\n178. The X-ray Luminosity Functions (XLFs) of the NGC 1333 and Serpens clusters\nare compared to each other and the Orion Nebula Cluster. Based on this\ncomparison, we obtain a new distance for the Serpens cluster of 360+22/-13 pc.\nThe X-ray luminosity was found to depend on the bolometric luminosity as in\nprevious studies of other clusters, and that Lx depends primarily on the\nstellar surface area. In the NGC 1333 cluster, the Class III sources have a\nsomewhat higher X-ray luminosity for a given surface area. We also find\nevidence in NGC 1333 for a jump in the X-ray luminosity between spectral types\nof M0 and K7, we speculate that this may result from the presence of radiative\nzones in the K-stars. The gas column density vs. extinction in the NGC 1333 was\nfound to be N_H = 0.89 +/- 0.13 x 10^22 A_K, this is lower than expected of the\nstandard ISM but similar to that found previously in the Serpens Cloud Core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 15:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In all three cases, a clear understanding of the resulting atomic\nstructure is desirable. However, determining the full structure of an epitaxial\nthin film (lattice parameters, space group, atomic positions, surface\nreconstructions) on a routine basis is a serious challenge. In this paper we\nhighlight the remarkable information that can be extracted from both the Bragg\nscattering and inelastic multiple scattering events that occur during\nReflection High Energy Electron Diffraction. We review some methods to extract\nstructural information and show how mature techniques used in other fields can\nbe directly applied to the {\\em in-situ} and real-time diffraction images of a\ngrowing film.
