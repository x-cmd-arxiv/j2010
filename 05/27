Also, to obtain\nan analytical probability distribution for stacked test statistics in the case\nof a search for pulsed emission from an ensemble of pulsars where the\nsignificance per pulsar is relatively low, making individual detections\ninsignificant on their own. This information is timely given the recent rapid\ndiscovery of new pulsars with the Fermi-LAT t $\\gamma$-ray telescope. Methods:\nApproximately $10^{14}$ realisations of the H-statistic ($H$) for random\n(white) noise is calculated from a random number generator for which the\nrepitition cycle is $\\gg 10^{14}$. From these numbers the probability\ndistribution $P(>H)$ is calculated. Results: The distribution of $H$ is is\nfound to be exponential with parameter $\\lambda=0.4$ so that the cumulative\nprobability distribution $P(>H)=\\exp{(-\\lambda H)}$. If we stack independent\nvalues for $H$, the sum of $K$ such values would follow the Erlang-K\ndistribution with parameter $\\lambda$ for which the cumulative probability\ndistribution is also a simple analytical expression. Conclusion: Searches for\nweak pulsars with unknown pulse profile shapes in the Fermi-LAT, Agile or other\nX-ray data bases should benefit from the {\\it H-test} since it is known to be\npowerful against a broad range of pulse profiles, which introduces only a\nsingle statistical trial if only the {\\it H-test} is used.

The answer to\nthis question depends not only on the structure of the network, but also on\ndetails of the dynamic processes occurring on it. We classify these processes\nas conservative and non-conservative. A random walk on a network is an example\nof a conservative dynamic process, while information spread is\nnon-conservative. The influence models used to rank network nodes can be\nsimilarly classified, depending on the dynamic process they implicitly emulate.\nWe claim that in order to correctly rank network nodes, the influence model has\nto match the details of the dynamic process. We study a real-world network on\nthe social news aggregator Digg, which allows users to post and vote for news\nstories. We empirically define influence as the number of in-network votes a\nuser's post generates. This influence measure, and the resulting ranking,\narises entirely from the dynamics of voting on Digg, which represents\nnon-conservative information flow.\n  We then compare predictions of different influence models with this empirical\nestimate of influence. The results show that non-conservative models are better\nable to predict influential users on Digg.

This equation admits a unique positive\nstationary solution, called the ground state. In 1975, Payne and Sattinger\nshowed that solutions with energy strictly below that of the ground state are\ndivided into two classes, depending on a suitable functional: If it is\nnegative, then one has finite time blowup, if it is nonnegative, global\nexistence; moreover, these sets are invariant under the flow.

For example, in a small\nneighborhood of the ground states one encounters the following trichotomy: on\none side of a center-stable manifold one has finite-time blowup, on the other\nside scattering to zero, and on the manifold itself one has scattering to the\nground state, all for positive time. In total, the class of initial data is\ndivided into nine disjoint nonempty sets, each displaying different asymptotic\nbehavior, which includes solutions blowing up in one time direction and\nscattering to zero on the other, and also, the analogue of those found by\nDuyckaerts and Merle for the energy critical wave and Schr\\\"odinger equations,\nexactly with the ground state energy.

The NMR\nspin-latticerelaxation rate $1/T_1$ deviates from the Korringa law below 100 K\nsignaling the onset of an energy gap $\\Delta E_g1/k_B \\simeq 30$K.

The Miller force, sometimes denoted\nthe gradient force, is of particular interest, because the direction as well as\nmagnitude of the Miller force on a plasma depends on the wave frequency. While\nplasma is usually considered in its gaseous form, solid bodies can also be\ntreated as plasma, denoted solid-state plasma. The first experimental proof of\nwave effects in magnetized solid-state plasmas (Lundqvist, 1949, Herlofson,\n1950) came after the suggestion by Alfv\\'en (1942) on the possible existence of\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves. However, most of our knowledge basis on\nMHD/Alfv\\'en waves have since then emerged from space- and laboratory (gaseous)\nplasmas. It is therefore timely to investigate further the applicability of e/m\nwave ponderomotive forcing on solid-state plasma. In this report we discuss the\napplicability of the ponderomotive Miller force on solid-state plasmas. At this\nstage the treatise will be rather qualitative, based on theories developed for\nspace plasma. We assume that e/m wave energy and momentum is transferred in a\nthin surface layer constituting solid-state plasma. A Miller force results from\nthe wave pressure gradient set up in the surface layer. Since the solid body\nconstitute a coupled system (lattice), the Miller force will act on all atoms\nin the body, the total force limited by the wave input power. A quantitative\ncomparison with experimental results obtained from a Cavendish vacuum\nexperiment (Lidgren and Lundin, 2010) gives a surprisingly good agreement\nbetween theory and experiments. As further proof for e/m wave attraction of\nmatter, we show a simulation, taking into account the measured pendulum\noffsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 19:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These simulations reveal an unexpectedly important\nrole of dispersion in combination with refraction. We demonstrate the effect of\nanalyzing observations which are shorter than the refractive scale. We examine\ntime-of-arrival fluctuations in detail: showing their correlation with\nintensity and dispersion measure; providing a heuristic model from which one\ncan estimate their contribution to pulsar timing observations; and showing that\nmuch of the effect can be corrected making use of measured intensity and\ndispersion. Finally, we analyze observations of the millisecond pulsar\nJ0437$-$4715, made with the Parkes radio telescope, that show timing\nfluctuations which are correlated with intensity. We demonstrate that these\ntiming fluctuations can be corrected, but we find that they are much larger\nthan would be expected from scattering in a homogeneous turbulent plasma with\nisotropic density fluctuations. We do not have an explanation for these timing\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 19:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Multiple widely-separated fields are\nobserved to provide a large number of statistically-independent samples of the\nhigh-redshift galaxy population. The expected Poisson uncertainty is removed\nfrom the measured dispersion in the distribution of galaxy number counts\nobserved across these many fields, leaving, on average, only the contribution\nto the scatter expected from cosmic variance. With knowledge of the Lambda Cold\nDark Matter power spectrum, the galaxy bias is then calculated from the\nmeasured cosmic variance. The results of cosmological N-body simulations can\nthen be used to estimate the halo mass associated with the measured bias. We\nuse Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that Hubble Space Telescope pure\nparallel programs will be able to determine galaxy bias at z>~6 using this\nmethod, complementing future measurements from correlation functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Here we present results from the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray\nbands obtained with Swift, XMM, and ATCA during a 10-day monitoring campaign in\nSeptember 2008. The simultaneous coverage at several wavelengths makes it\npossible to investigate in detail the broadband spectral energy distribution\n(SED) and the energetic of this source. The main results can be summarized as\nfollows. The ATCA reveals the presence of an extended radio emission in PKS\n0558-504 with two lobe-like structures at ~7\" from the bright central source.\nThe extended radio structure and the low value of the radio-loudness similar to\nradio-quiet Seyfert galaxies coupled with constraints from higher energy bands\nargue against a jet-dominated emission. The study of the SED, which is\ndominated by a nearly constant optical-UV emission, supports the conclusion\nthat PKS 0558-504 is accreting at super-Eddington rate. This conclusion was\nreached assuming M_BH=2.5e8 M_sun, which was obtained with a new scaling method\nbased on X-ray spectral variability results. A comparison between the accretion\nluminosity and the kinetic power associated with the jet suggests that in this\nsource the accretion power dominates in agreement with the results obtained\nfrom Radiation-MHD simulations of Galactic black holes (GBHs) accreting at the\nEddington rate. The combined findings from this panchromatic investigation\nstrongly suggest that PKS 0558-504 is a large-scale analog of GBHs in their\nhighly accreting intermediate state. Importantly, PKS 0558-504 may also be the\nprototype of the parent population of the very radio-loud NLS1s recently\ndetected at gamma-ray energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 20:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Building on earlier work, we propose\na simple physical model for the early evolution (several 10^8 yr) of GCs. We\nconsider the effects of stellar mass-loss, type II and prompt type Ia\nsupernovae, ram pressure, and accretion from the ambient ISM on the development\nof a young GC's own gas reservoir. In our model, type II SNe from a first\ngeneration of star formation clears the GC of its initial gas reservoir. Over\nthe next several 10^8 yr, mass lost from AGB stars and matter accreted from the\nambient ISM collect at the center of the GC. This material must remain quite\ncool (T~10^2K), but does not catastrophically cool on a crossing time because\nof the high Lyman-Werner flux density in young GCs. The collection of gas\nwithin the GC must compete with ram pressure from the ambient ISM. After\nseveral 10^8 yr, the Lyman-Werner photon flux density drops by more than three\norders of magnitude, allowing molecular hydrogen and then stars to form. After\nthis second generation of star formation, type II SNe from the second\ngeneration and then prompt type Ia SNe associated with the first generation\nmaintain a gas-free GC, thereby ending the cycle of star formation events. Our\nmodel makes clear predictions for the presence or absence of multiple stellar\npopulations within GCs as a function of GC mass and formation environment.\nAnalyzing intermediate-age LMC clusters, we find evidence for a mass threshold\nof ~10^4 Msun below which LMC clusters appear to be truly coeval. This\nthreshold mass is consistent with our predictions for the mass at which ram\npressure is capable of clearing gas from clusters in the LMC at the present\nepoch.

We present an analysis strategy of reconstructing open charm\nmesons with ALICE via the hadronic decay of D0 and D* mesons. Heavy flavours,\nproduced at the The Large Hadron Collider, are excellent tools to investigate\nthe properties of the QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Baseline\nmeasurements of heavy flavour production mechanisms in pp collisions are\nnecessary in order to understand the production in the medium as well as medium\ninduced effects. The study shows that for one year of data taking we will be\nable to measure charmed mesons with very large significances (78 for D0 and 33\nfor D?). Both yields allow a measurement in one month of data taking (about 100\nmillion events) with a D? significance of 10. The reconstruction of the charged\nmesons is more difficult than for the neutral mesons due to kinematic\nconstraints on the soft pion in case of the D* decay. Most of these pions have\nmomenta lower than 0.4 GeV/c which makes them difficult to detect and therefore\nthe reconstruction efficiency is very low. However, by using the ALICE Inner\nTracking System as a standalone detector, the reconstruction efficiencies for\nkaons and pions at very low momenta are improved. Due to selection criteria\nimposed on the tracks the overall efficiency increase for the D* with the\nITS-standalone procedure is reported to be 7%. Note that after applying the\ncuts on the D mesons, the contamination with D0 from beauty decays becomes\nslightly larger (10%). For analyses where high efficiency is preferred over\nhigh purity, the cuts on the D* and D0 can be loosened in order to have as many\nparticles as possible. In this case, a review of the contamination from B\ndecays is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 21:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

Infrared dark clouds\nhave been identified predominantly toward the bright inner parts of the\ngalactic plane. The low background emission makes it more difficult to identify\nsimilar objects in mid-infrared absorption in the outer parts. This is\nunfortunate, because the outer Galaxy represents the only nearby region where\nwe can study effects of different (external) conditions on the star formation\nprocess. The aim of this paper is to identify extended red regions in the outer\ngalactic plane based on reddening of stars in the near-infrared. We argue that\nthese regions appear reddened mainly due to extinction caused by molecular\nclouds and young stellar objects. The work presented here is used as a basis\nfor identifying star forming regions and in particular the very early stages.\nWe use the Mann-Whitney U-test, in combination with a friends-of-friends\nalgorithm, to identify extended reddened regions in the 2MASS all-sky JHK\nsurvey.

The two resolutions have been chosen because the stellar surface\ndensity varies between the crowded spiral arm regions and the sparsely\npopulated galactic anti-center region. We identify 1320 extended red regions at\nthe higher resolution and 1589 at the lower resolution run. The majority of\nregions are associated with major molecular cloud complexes, supporting our\nhypothesis that the reddening is mostly due to foreground clouds and embedded\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 21:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A comparison\nof this late-time \"bump\" to SN 1998bw (the broad-lined Type Ic supernova\nassociated with GRB 980425), and several other GRB supernovae (SNe), indicates\nthat the most straightforward explanation is that GRB 091127 was accompanied by\na contemporaneous SN (SN 2009nz) that peaked at a magnitude of M_V=-19.0+/-0.2.\nSN 2009nz is globally similar to other GRB supernovae, but evolves slightly\nfaster than SN 1998bw and reaches a slightly dimmer peak magnitude. We also\nanalyze the early-time UV-optical-IR spectral energy distribution of the\nafterglow of GRB 091127 and find that there is little to no reddening in the\nhost galaxy along the line-of-slight to this burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 22:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 22:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

When paired with molecular spectroscopy of a\ndense gas tracer, millimeter observations yield physical properties such as\nmasses, radii, mean densities, kinetic temperatures and line widths. We detect\n34 distinct BGPS sources above 5-sigma=0.37 Jy/beam with corresponding 5-sigma\ndetections in the ammonia (1,1) transition. Eight of the objects show water\nmaser emission (20%). We find a mean millimeter source FWHM of 1.12 pc, and a\nmean kinetic temperature of 20 K for the sample of 34 BGPS sources. The\nobserved ammonia line widths are dominated by non-thermal motions, typically\nfound to be a few times the thermal sound speed expected for the derived\nkinetic temperature. We calculate the mass for each source from the millimeter\nflux assuming the sources are isothermal and find a mean isothermal mass within\na 120\" aperture of 230 +/- 180 solar masses. We find a total mass of 8,400\nsolar masses for all BGPS sources in the Gemini OB1 molecular cloud,\nrepresenting 6.5% of the cloud mass.

Starting from observed SMF for\nstar-forming galaxies, we use backwards models to predict the evolution of a\nnumber of quantities, such as the SFR function, the cosmic SFR density and the\nVelocity Function. The velocity being a parameter attached to a galaxy during\nits history (contrary to the stellar mass), this approach allows us to quantify\nthe number density evolution of galaxies of a given velocity, e.g. of the Milky\nWay siblings. Observations suggest that the SMF of star forming galaxies is\nconstant between redshift 0 and 1. In order to reproduce this result, we must\nquench star formation in a number of star forming galaxies. The SMF of these\nquenched galaxies is consistent with available data concerning the increase in\nthe population of quiescent galaxies in the same redshift interval. The SMF of\nquiescent galaxies is then mainly determined by the distribution of active\ngalaxies that must stop star formation, with a modest mass redistribution\nduring mergers. The cosmic SFR density, and the evolution of the SFR functions\nare relatively well recovered, although they provide some clue for a small\nevolution of the SMF of star forming galaxies at the lowest redshifts. We thus\nconsider that we have obtained in a simple way a relatively consistent picture\nof the evolution of galaxies at intermediate redshifts. We note that if this\npicture is correct, 50 percent of the Milky-Way sisters (galaxies with the same\nvelocity as our Galaxy, i.e. 220 km/s) have quenched their star formation since\nredshift 1 (and an even larger fraction for larger velocities).

The Herschel measurements provide additional data points\nthat constrain the FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of both sources,\nand they emphasise a broad range of dust temperatures in these objects. For\nlambda_rest ~< 20mu, the two SEDs are very similar to the average SEDs of\nquasars at low redshift. In the FIR, however, both quasars show excess emission\ncompared to low-z QSO templates, most likely from cold dust powered by vigorous\nstar formation in the QSO host galaxies. For SDSS J1148+5251 we detect another\nobject at 160mu with a distance of ~10 arcseconds from the QSO. Although no\nphysical connection between the quasar and this object can be shown with the\navailable data, it could potentially confuse low-resolution measurements, thus\nresulting in an overestimate of the FIR luminosity of the z=6.42 quasar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 09:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We find that the diamond phase is never\nstable for our longer-ranged potential. At low temperatures and pressures, the\nfluid freezes into a body-centred-cubic solid that can be viewed as two\ninterpenetrating diamond lattices with a weak interaction between the two\nsublattices. Upon compression, an orientationally ordered face-centred-cubic\ncrystal becomes more stable than the body-centred-cubic crystal, and at higher\ntemperatures a plastic face-centered-cubic phase is stabilized by the increased\nentropy due to orientational disorder. A similar phase diagram is found for the\nshorter-ranged potential, but at low temperatures and pressures, we also find a\nregion over which the diamond phase is thermodynamically favored over the\nbody-centred-cubic phase. The higher vibrational entropy of the diamond\nstructure with respect to the body-centred-cubic solid explains why it is\nstable even though the enthalpy of the latter phase is lower. Some preliminary\nstudies on the growth of the diamond structure starting from a crystal seed\nwere performed. Even though the diamond phase is never thermodynamically stable\nfor the longer-ranged model, direct coexistence simulations of the interface\nbetween the fluid and the body-centred-cubic crystal and between the fluid and\nthe diamond crystal show that, at sufficiently low pressures, it is quite\nprobable that in both cases the solid grows into a diamond crystal, albeit\ninvolving some defects.

The Hanle effect, acting on the scattering\npolarization in suitable lines, can in principle be used as a diagnostic for\nthese fields. However, the prediction that the majority of the weak, turbulent\nfield resides in intergranular lanes also poses significant challenges to\nscattering polarization observations because high spatial resolution is usually\ndifficult to attain. We aim to measure the difference in scattering\npolarization between granules and intergranules. We present the respective\ncenter-to-limb variations, which may serve as input for future models. We\nperform full Stokes filter polarimetry at different solar limb positions with\nthe CN band filter of the Hinode-SOT Broadband Filter Imager, which represents\nthe first scattering polarization observations with sufficient spatial\nresolution to discern the granulation. Hinode-SOT offers unprecedented spatial\nresolution in combination with high polarimetric sensitivity. The CN band is\nknown to have a significant scattering polarization signal, and is sensitive to\nthe Hanle effect. We extend the instrumental polarization calibration routine\nto the observing wavelength, and correct for various systematic effects. The\nscattering polarization for granules (i.e., regions brighter than the median\nintensity of non-magnetic pixels) is significantly larger than for\nintergranules. We derive that the intergranules (i.e., the remaining\nnon-magnetic pixels) exhibit (9.8 \\pm 3.0)% less scattering polarization for\n0.2<u<0.3, although systematic effects cannot be completely excluded. These\nobservations constrain MHD models in combination with (polarized) radiative\ntransfer in terms of CN band line formation, radiation anisotropy, and magnetic\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 12:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this\npaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of the\nSPIRE instrument using a combination of the emission from the Herschel\ntelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objects\nand other astronomical targets. We present the photometric, spectroscopic and\nspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the \"standard\"\npipelines. The overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission is\nestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for the\nspectrometer. However, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of the\nspectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the SPIRE\nspectrometer band. The spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to be\nbetter than 1/10th of the line FWHM. The astrometric accuracy in SPIRE maps is\nfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. The photometric\ncalibration of the SPIRE instrument is currently determined by a combination of\nuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the data\nprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. Improvements in\nprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performance\nwill lead to the final calibration accuracy of SPIRE being determined only by\nuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 13:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\nastrometric corrections necessary to perform high precision astrometry are\ndescribed and their contribution to the overall precision is investigated. Due\nto large uncertainties in the pixel-scale and the orientation of the detector,\nno detection of the astrometric orbit signal was possible. The image quality of\nground-based telescopes is limited by the turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. The\ninduced distortions of the light can be measured and corrected with the\nadaptive optics technique. However, the correction is only useful within a\nsmall angle around the guide star. The novel correction technique of multi\nconjugated adaptive optics uses several guide stars to correct a larger field\nof view. The VLT/MAD instrument was built to demonstrate this technique.\nObservations with MAD are analyzed in terms of astrometric precision in this\nwork. Two sets of data are compared, which were obtained in different\ncorrection modes: pure ground layer correction and full multi conjugated\ncorrection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 15:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

The mathematical technique\nrelies on the assumption that entropy is nearly constant (\"well-mixed\") in\nisorotation surfaces both outside and within the tachocline. The resulting\nsolutions exhibit nontrivial features that strikingly resemble the true\ntachocline isorotation contours in unexpected detail. This strengthens the\nmathematical premises of the theory. The observed rotation pattern in the\ntachocline shows strong quadrupolar structure, an important feature that is\nexplicitly used in constructing our solutions. The tachocline is treated\nlocally as an interior boundary layer of small but finite thickness, and an\nexplicit global solution is then constructed. A dynamical link can thus be\nestablished between the internal jump in the angular velocity at the tachocline\nand the spread of angular velocities observed near the solar surface.
