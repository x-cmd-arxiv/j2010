The\ndevice involves a bubble generation section and a gas removal section. In the\nbubble generation section, a T-junction is used to generate a train of gas\nplugs into a water stream. These gas plugs are then transported towards the gas\nremoval section, where they slide along a hydrophobic membrane until complete\nremoval.

The first criterion is that the bubble length needs to be larger\nthan the channel diameter. The second criterion is that the gas plug should\nstay on the membrane for a time sufficient to transport all the gas through the\nmembrane.

A hopping event occurs only over the distance R_h at a\nthermally activated accidental coincidence of the acceptor levels in charge\nstates (0) and (-1). Donors block the fraction K/(1 - K) of impurity lattice\nsites. The hole hopping conductivity is averaged over all possible orientations\nof the lattice with respect to the external electric field direction. It is\nsupposed that an acceptor band is formed by Gaussian fluctuations of the\npotential energy of boron atoms in charge state (-1) due to Coulomb interaction\nonly between the ions at distance R_h. The shift of the acceptor band towards\nthe top of the valence band with increasing N due to screening (in the\nDebye--H\\\"uckel approximation) of the impurity ions by holes hopping via\nacceptor states was taken into account. The calculated values of \\sigma_3(N)\nand \\epsilon_3(N) for K \\approx 0.25 agree well with known experimental data at\nthe insulator side of the insulator--metal phase transition. The calculation is\ncarried out at a temperature two times lower than the transition temperature\nfrom hole transport in v-band of diamond to hopping conductance via boron\natoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 22:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2011 10:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-06"}

A flux tube is assumed to lie initially near the top of the stably\nstratified radiative core below the convection zone, but a segment of it is\nperturbed into the convection zone by gradual heating and convective overshoot\nmotions. The ends (\"footpoints\") of the segment remain anchored at the base of\nthe convection zone, and if the segment is sufficiently long, it may be\nbuoyantly unstable, rising through the convection zone in a short time. The\nlength of the flux tube determines the ratio of buoyancy to magnetic tension:\nshort loops of flux are arrested before reaching the top of the convection\nzone, while longer loops emerge to erupt through the photosphere. Using\nSpruit's convection zone model, we compute the minimum footpoint separation\n$L_c$ required for erupting flux tubes. We explore the dependence of $L_c$ on\nthe initial thermal state of the perturbed flux tube segment and on its initial\nmagnetic field strength. Following an investigation of thermal diffusion time\nscales and the dynamic rise times of unstable flux tube segments, we conclude\nthat the most likely origin for magnetic flux which erupts to the surface is\nfrom short length scale perturbations ($L < L_c$) which are initially stable,\nbut which are subsequently destabilized either by diffusion of heat into the\ntube or by stretching of the anchor points until $L$ just exceeds $L_c$. In\neither case, the separation of the anchor points of the emergent tube should\nlie between the critical distance for a tube in mechanical equilibrium and one\nin thermal equilibrium. Finally, after comparing the dispersion of dynamic rise\ntimes with the much shorter observed active region formation time scales, we\nconclude that active regions form from the emergence of a single flux tube\nsegment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2010 11:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

A series of such entropies\nhave been proposed in the past, mainly to accommodate important empirical\ndistribution functions to a maximum ignorance principle. Until now the\nunderstanding of the fundamental origin of these entropies and its deeper\nrelations to complex systems is limited. Here we explore this questions from\nfirst principles. We start by observing that the 4th Khinchin axiom\n(separability axiom) is violated by strongly interacting systems in general and\nask about the consequences of violating the 4th axiom while assuming the first\nthree Khinchin axioms (K1-K3) to hold and $S_g=\\sum_ig(p_i)$. We prove by\nsimple scaling arguments that under these requirements {\\em each} statistical\nsystem is uniquely characterized by a distinct pair of scaling exponents\n$(c,d)$ in the large size limit. The exponents define equivalence classes for\nall interacting and non interacting systems. This allows to derive a unique\nentropy, $S_{c,d}\\propto \\sum_i \\Gamma(d+1, 1- c \\ln p_i)$, which covers all\nentropies which respect K1-K3 and can be written as $S_g=\\sum_ig(p_i)$. Known\nentropies can now be classified within these equivalence classes. The\ncorresponding distribution functions are special forms of Lambert-$W$\nexponentials containing as special cases Boltzmann, stretched exponential and\nTsallis distributions (power-laws) -- all widely abundant in nature. This is,\nto our knowledge, the first {\\em ab initio} justification for the existence of\ngeneralized entropies. Even though here we assume $S_g=\\sum_ig(p_i)$, we show\nthat more general entropic forms can be classified along the same lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2010 12:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 11:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}
