To overcome the unavoidable decoherence in\nnoisy channel, to date, many efforts have focused on faithfully transmitting\none state by consuming large numbers of synchronized ancillary states. However,\nhuge demands of quantum resources are hard to meet with current technology,\nthus restrict practical applications. Here we propose and demonstrate an\neconomical method of reliably transmitting quantum information. An arbitrary\nunknown quantum state is converted into time bins deterministically in terms of\nits own polarization using a modified Franson interferometer. Any arisen noise\nin channel will induce an associated error to the reference frame of the time\nbins, which can be utilized to reject errors and recover the initial state. By\nvirtue of state-independent feature, our method can be applied to entanglement\ndistribution. After passing through 0.8 km randomly twisted optical fiber, the\nentanglement still survives and is verified. Our approach significantly\nsimplifies the implementation of quantum EFT and enables a general quantum\nstate even entanglement to be protected by feedback, thus can be used as a\nbasic building block in practical long-distance quantum communication network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 16:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-04"}

Our focus is on the time-dependent effects\nof the resonant scattering. We first show that the frequency distribution of\nphotons in the halo are quickly approaching to a locally thermalized state\naround the resonant frequency, even when the mean intensity of the radiation is\nhighly time-dependent. Since initial conditions are forgotten during the\nthermalization, some features of the flux, such as the two peak structure of\nits profile, actually are independent of the intrinsic width and time behavior\nof the central source, if the emergent photons are mainly from photons in the\nthermalized state. In this case, the difference $|\\nu_{\\pm}-\\nu_0|$, where\n$\\nu_{\\pm}$ are the frequencies of the two peaks of the flux, cannot be less\nthan $2$ times of Doppler broadening. We then study the radiative transfer in\nthe case where the light emitted from the central source is a flash. We\ncalculate the light curves of the flux from the halo. It shows that the flux is\nstill a flash. The time duration of the flash for the flux, however, is\nindependent of the original time duration of the light source but depends on\nthe optical depth of the halo. Therefore, the spatial transfer of resonant\nphotons is a diffusion process, even though it is not a purely Brownian\ndiffusion. This property enables an optically thick halo to trap and store\nthermalized photons around $\\nu_0$ for a long time after the cease of the\ncentral source emission. The photons trapped in the halo can yield delayed\nemission, of which the profile also shows typical two peak structure as that\nfrom locally thermalized photons. Possible applications of these results are\naddressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 16:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

An individual vehicle in the formation is assumed to be a fully\nactuated point mass. A distributed control law is examined: the control action\non an individual vehicle depends on (i) its own velocity and (ii) the relative\nposition measurements with a small subset of vehicles (neighbors) in the\nformation. The neighbors are defined according to an information graph.\n  In this paper we describe a methodology for modeling, analysis, and\ndistributed control design of such vehicular formations whose information graph\nis a D-dimensional lattice. The modeling relies on an approximation based on a\npartial differential equation (PDE) that describes the spatio-temporal\nevolution of position errors in the formation. The analysis and control design\nis based on the PDE model. We deduce asymptotic formulae for the closed-loop\nstability margin (absolute value of the real part of the least stable\neigenvalue) of the controlled formation. The stability margin is shown to\napproach 0 as the number of vehicles N goes to infinity. The exponent on the\nscaling law for the stability margin is influenced by the dimension and the\nstructure of the information graph. We show that the scaling law can be\nimproved by employing a higher dimensional information graph.\n  Apart from analysis, the PDE model is used for a mistuning-based design of\ncontrol gains to maximize the stability margin. Mistuning here refers to small\nperturbation of control gains from their nominal symmetric values. We show that\nthe mistuned design can have a significantly better stability margin even with\na small amount of perturbation.

We studied the achievable precision in the estimate\nof the ionospheric dispersion and the dynamic range of the correlated fringes\nfor different distributions of sub-bands in low-frequency and wide-band\ninterferometric observations. Our study is focused on the case of sub-bands\nwith a bandwidth much narrower than that of the total covered spectrum (case of\nLOFAR). We computed the uncertainty of the ionospheric delay, the delay\nambiguity, and the dynamic range of the fringes using four different kinds of\nsub-band distributions: constant spacing between sub-bands, random spacings,\nspacings based on a power-law distribution, and spacings based on Golomb rulers\n(sets of integers whose sets of differences have non-repeated elements). For a\nlarge number of sub-bands ($> 20$, depending on the delay window) spacings\nbased on Golomb rulers give the most precise estimates of dispersive effects\nand the highest fringe dynamic ranges. Spacings based on the power-law\ndistribution give similar results, although better than those with the Golomb\nrulers for smaller number of sub-bands. Random distributions result in large\nfringe dynamic ranges, but the estimate of dispersive effects is worse. A\nconstant spacing of sub-bands results in very bad fringe dynamic ranges, but\ngood estimates of ionospheric dispersion.

Its proximity and its jet, misaligned from our\nline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling at\nradio, optical, and X-ray energies. Flaring activity was observed at all\nenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin of\nthe VHE emission. In this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectral\nanalysis of the VERITAS VHE gamma-ray observations of M87 in 2008 and 2009. In\nthe 2008 observing season, VERITAS detected an excess with a statistical\nsignificance of 7.2 sigma from M87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoring\ncampaign conducted by three major VHE experiments along with the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory. In February 2008, VERITAS observed a VHE flare from M87 occurring\nover a 4-day timespan. The peak nightly flux above 250GeV was 7.7% of the Crab\nNebula flux. M87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, and\nwas not detected afterwards. Spectral analysis of the VERITAS observations\nshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare and\npre-flare states. Shortly after the VHE flare seen by VERITAS, the Chandra\nX-ray Observatory detected the flux from the core of M87 at a historical\nmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot HST-1 remained quiescent. Acciari\net al. (2009) presented the 2008 contemporaneous VHE gamma-ray, Chandra X-ray,\nand VLBA radio observations which suggest the core as the most likely source of\nVHE emission, in contrast to the 2005 VHE flare that was simultaneous with an\nX-ray flare in the HST-1 knot. In 2009, VERITAS continued its monitoring of M87\nand marginally detected a 4.2 sigma excess corresponding to a flux of ~1% of\nthe Crab Nebula. No VHE flaring activity was observed in 2009.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 18:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

First, we calibrate a relation between X/NeV and the cold\nabsorbing column density N_H using a sample of 74 bright, nearby Seyferts with\nboth X-ray and [Ne V] data available in the literature. Similarly to what is\nfound for the X-ray to [O III]5007 flux ratio (X/OIII), we found that the X/NeV\nratio decreases towards large column densities. Essentially all local Seyferts\nwith X/NeV values below 15 are found to be Compton-Thick objects. Second, we\napply this diagnostic diagram to different samples of distant obscured and\nunobscured QSOs in the SDSS: blue, unobscured, type-1 QSOs in the redshift\nrange z=[0.1-1.5] show X/NeV values typical of unobscured Seyfert 1s in the\nlocal Universe. Conversely, SDSS type-2 QSOs at z~0.5 classified either as\nCompton-Thick or Compton-Thin on the basis of their X/OIII ratio, would have\nbeen mostly classified in the same way based on the X/NeV ratio. We apply the\nX/NeV diagnostic diagram to 9 SDSS obscured QSOs in the redshift range\nz=[0.85-1.31], selected by means of their prominent [Ne V]3426 line and\nobserved with Chandra ACIS-S for 10ks each.

When excluding from the sample broad lined QSOs with\na red continuum and thus considering only genuine narrow-line objects, the\nefficiency in selecting Compton-Thick QSOs through the [Ne V] line is about 50%\n(with large errors, though), more similar to what is achieved with [O III]\nselection.

Cognitive secondary users (SUs) are assumed to initially\nperform channel sensing to detect the activities of the primary users, and then\nattempt to estimate the channel fading coefficients through training. Energy\ndetection is employed for channel sensing, and different minimum\nmean-square-error (MMSE) estimation methods are considered for channel\nestimation. In both channel sensing and estimation, erroneous decisions can be\nmade, and hence, channel uncertainty is not completely eliminated. In this\nsetting, performance is studied and interactions between channel sensing and\nestimation are investigated.\n  Following the channel sensing and estimation tasks, SUs engage in data\ntransmission. Transmitter, being unaware of the channel fading coefficients, is\nassumed to send the data at fixed power and rate levels that depend on the\nchannel sensing results. Under these assumptions, a state-transition model is\nconstructed by considering the reliability of the transmissions, channel\nsensing decisions and their correctness, and the evolution of primary user\nactivity which is modeled as a two-state Markov process. In the data\ntransmission phase, an average power constraint on the secondary users is\nconsidered to limit the interference to the primary users, and statistical\nlimitations on the buffer lengths are imposed to take into account the QoS\nconstraints of the secondary traffic. The maximum throughput under these\nstatistical QoS constraints is identified by finding the effective capacity of\nthe cognitive radio channel.

In a previous article we introduced models of\ntruncated jets from disks, i.e. evolved in time numerical simulations based on\na radially self-similar MHD solution, but including the effects of a finite\nradius of the jet-emitting disk and thus the outflow. These models need now to\nbe compared with available observational data. A direct comparison of the\nresults of combined analytical theoretical models and numerical simulations\nwith observations has not been performed as yet. In order to compare our models\nwith observed jet widths inferred from recent optical images taken with HST and\nAO observations, we use a new set of tools to create emission maps in different\nforbidden lines, from which we determine the jet width as the FWHM of the\nemission. It is shown that the untruncated analytical disk outflow solution\nconsidered here cannot fit the small jet widths inferred by observations of\nseveral jets. Various truncated disk-wind models are examined, whose extracted\njet widths range from higher to lower values compared to the observations. Thus\nwe can fit the observed range of jet widths by tuning our models. We conclude\nthat truncation is necessary to reproduce the observed jet widths and our\nsimulations limit the possible range of truncation radii. We infer that the\ntruncation radius, which is the radius on the disk mid-plane where the\njet-emitting disk switches to a standard disk, must be between around 0.1 up to\nabout 1 AU in the observed sample for the considered disk-wind solution. One\ndisk-wind simulation with an inner truncation radius at about 0.11 AU also\nshows potential for reproducing the observations, but a parameter study is\nneeded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Our model makes\nno assumptions about light tracing mass, yet we reproduce the brightest visible\nstructures with some slight deviations. A1689 remains one of the strongest\nknown lenses on the sky, with an Einstein radius of RE = 47.0\" +/- 1.2\" (143\n+3/-4 kpc) for a lensed source at zs = 2. We find a single NFW or Sersic prole\nyields a good fit simultaneously (with only slight tension) to both our strong\nlensing (SL) mass model and published weak lensing (WL) measurements at larger\nradius (out to the virial radius). According to this NFW fit, A1689 has a mass\nof Mvir = 2.0 +0.5/-0.3 x 10^15 Msun / h70 (M200 = 1.8 +0.4/-0.3 x 10^15 Msun /\nh70) within the virial radius rvir = 3.0 +/- 0.2 Mpc / h70 (r200 = 2.4\n+0.1/-0.2 Mpc / h70), and a central concentration cvir = 11.5 +1.5/-1.4 (c200 =\n9.2 +/- 1.2). Our SL model prefers slightly higher concentrations than previous\nSL models, bringing our SL+WL constraints in line with other recent\nderivations. Our results support those of previous studies which find A1689 has\neither an anomalously large concentration or significant extra mass along the\nline of sight (perhaps in part due to triaxiality). If clusters are generally\nfound to have higher concentrations than realized in simulations, this could\nindicate they formed earlier, perhaps as a result of early dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 20:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-24"}

In the\nprocess, we strengthen and generalize our previous results (FOCS 2008).\nAdditionally, we unify the approach in that work and the communication\ncomplexity based approach. Our work reduces the problem of proving cell probe\nlower bounds of near neighbor search to computing the appropriate expansion\nparameter. In our results, as in all previous results, the dependence on $t$ is\nweak; that is, the bound drops exponentially in $t$. We show a much stronger\n(tight) time-space tradeoff for the class of dynamic low contention data\nstructures. These are data structures that supports updates in the data set and\nthat do not look up any single cell too often.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 22:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-05"}

Thus, a\nknowledge of the SMBH spin distribution and evolution is necessary to develop a\ncomprehensive theory of the growth of SMBHs and their impact on galaxy\nformation. Currently, the only direct measurement of SMBH spin is through\nfitting the broad Fe K line in AGNs. The evolution of spins could be determined\nby fitting the broad line in the integrated spectra of AGNs over different\nredshift intervals. The accuracy of these measurements will depend on the\nobserved integrated line strength.

In the present paper we take, in the capacity of A,\nthe algebra c_0 of vanishing sequences and consider the class of the so-called\nhomogeneous modules, over the latter algebra, denoted by H. The main theorem\ngives a full description of essential homogeneous modules over the mentioned\nalgebra that are extremely flat with respect to H. (In particular, all\nl_p-sums; p<infinity of normed spaces of integrable functions on different\nmeasure spaces have the indicated property). As a corollary, some theorems of\nHahn-Banach type, concerning extensions of c_0-module morphisms with\npreservation of their norms, are obtained. (In particular, l_p-sums of normed\nspaces of essentially bounded functions play, in the relevant context, the same\nrole as the scalar field in the classical Hahn-Banach Theorem). Besides, the\nfollowing related result is established. If I is a topologically injective\nmorphism of normed c_0-modules, then for every normed c_0-module Z, the\nnon-completed projective tensor product of I and the identity morphism on Z is\nalso injective (despite it is, generally speaking, not topologically\ninjective). If I is a (just) injective bounded morphism, then such a tensor\nproduct is not bound to be injective. Finally, it is shown that we can not omit\nthe word \"essential\" in the formulation of the main theorem.

Taking an\ninformation-based approach to the reserving problem, we derive the process of\nthe conditional distribution of the ultimate loss. The \"best-estimate ultimate\nloss process\" is given by the conditional expectation of the ultimate loss. We\nderive explicit expressions for the best-estimate ultimate loss process, and\nfor expected recoveries arising from aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance\ntreaties. Use of a deterministic time change allows for the matching of any\ninitial (increasing) development pattern for the paid claims. We show that\nthese methods are well-suited to the modelling of claims where there is a\nnon-trivial probability of catastrophic loss. The generalized inverse-Gaussian\n(GIG) distribution is shown to be a natural choice for the a priori ultimate\nloss distribution. For particular GIG parameter choices, the best-estimate\nultimate loss process can be written as a rational function of the paid-claims\nprocess. We extend the model to include a second paid-claims process, and allow\nthe two processes to be dependent.

The minima of the h-outage error probability and the MSE are obtained\nby the generalized maximum a-posteriori probability and the minimum MSE (MMSE)\nestimators, respectively. However, computation of these estimators and their\ncorresponding performance is usually not tractable and thus, lower bounds on\nthese terms can be very useful for performance analysis. The proposed class of\nlower bounds on the outage error probability is derived using Holder's\ninequality. This class is utilized to derive a new class of Bayesian MSE\nbounds. It is shown that for unimodal symmetric conditional probability density\nfunctions (pdf) the tightest probability of outage error lower bound in the\nproposed class attains the minimum probability of outage error and the tightest\nMSE bound coincides with the MMSE performance. In addition, it is shown that\nthe proposed MSE bounds are always tighter than the Ziv-Zakai lower bound\n(ZZLB).

These complexes are formed when short and flexible polyelectrolyte\nchains adsorb onto oppositely charged colloidal spheres, dispersed in an\nelectrolyte solution. In our simulations the bending energy between adjacent\nmonomers is small compared to the electrostatic energy, and the chains, once\nadsorbed, do not exchange with the solution, although they rearrange on the\nparticles surface to accomodate further adsorbing chains or due to the\nelectrostatic interaction with neighbor complexes. Rather unexpectedly, when\ntwo interacting particles approach each others, the rearrangement of the\nsurface charge distribution invariably produces anti-parallel dipolar doublets,\nthat invert their orientation at the isoelectric point. These findings clearly\nrule out a contribution of dipole-dipole interactions to the observed\nattractive interaction between the complexes, pointing out that such\nsuspensions can not be considered dipolar fluids.

We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and\nshow that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we\nprove to be essentially optimal.

This process realizes an interacting particle system with\nlong-ranged strong repulsive forces acting between any pair of particles. When\nthe individual diffusion process is a one-dimensional Brownian motion, the\nnoncolliding process is equivalent in distribution with the eigenvalue process\nof an $N \\times N$ Hermitian-matrix-valued process, which we call Dyson's\nmodel. For any deterministic initial configuration of $N$ particles,\ndistribution of particle positions of the noncolliding Brownian motion on the\nreal line at any fixed time $t >0$ is a determinantal point process. We can\nprove that the process is determinantal in the sense that the multi-time\ncorrelation function for any chosen series of times, which determines joint\ndistributions at these times, is also represented by a determinant. We study\nthe asymptotic behavior of the system, when the number of Brownian motions $N$\nin the system tends to infinity. This problem is concerned with the random\nmatrix theory on the asymptotics of eigenvalue distributions, when the matrix\nsize becomes infinity.

We report the results of\nour research project to construct and study finite and infinite particle\nsystems with long-ranged strong interactions realized by noncolliding\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2010 14:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 00:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-21"}

A superball's interior is defined\nby the inequality $|x|^{2q} + |y|^{2q} + |z|^{2q} \\leq 1$, which provides a\nversatile family of convex particles ($q \\geq 0.5$) with cube-like and\noctahedron-like shapes as well as concave particles ($q < 0.5$) with\noctahedron-like shapes. Here, we consider the convex case with a deformation\nparameter q between the sphere point (q = 1) and the cube (q = 1). We find that\nthe asphericity plays a significant role in the extent of cubatic ordering of\nboth the liquid and crystal phases. Calculation of the first few virial\ncoefficients shows that superballs that are visually similar to cubes can have\nlow-density equations of state closer to spheres than to cubes. Dense liquids\nof superballs display cubatic orientational order that extends over several\nparticle lengths only for large q. Along the ordered, high-density equation of\nstate, superballs with 1 < q < 3 exhibit clear evidence of a phase transition\nfrom a crystal state to a state with reduced long-ranged orientational order\nupon the reduction of density. For $q \\geq 3$, long-ranged orientational order\npersists until the melting transition. The width of coexistence region between\nthe liquid and ordered, high-density phase decreases with q up to q = 4.0. The\nstructures of the high-density phases are examined using certain order\nparameters, distribution functions, and orientational correlation functions. We\nalso find that a fixed simulation cell induces artificial phase transitions\nthat are out of equilibrium. Current fabrication techniques allow for the\nsynthesis of colloidal superballs, and thus the phase behavior of such systems\ncan be investigated experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2010 14:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by\nmultiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These\nmutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single\none from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a \"soft\" sweep). Here we study\nmodels of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a\nglobal selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can\nallow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species\nrange. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow\ndramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a\nsignal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate\nover time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within\nthe global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed\nby mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of\ncrystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel\nmutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by\na single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading\nallele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This\ncharacteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter,\nthe effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the\nstrength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such\nparallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict, as\nmore data becomes available, many more examples of intra-species parallel\nadaptation will be uncovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2010 15:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 22:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 01:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

First, we show that the line-of-sight solution\nto cosmic microwave anisotropies in Fourier space, even though formally defined\nfor arbitrarily large wavelengths, leads to position-space solutions which only\ndepend on the sources of anisotropies inside the past light-cone of the\nobserver. This happens order by order in a series expansion in powers of the\nvisibility $\\gamma=e^{-\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the optical depth to Thompson\nscattering. We show that the CMB anisotropies are regulated by spacetime window\nfunctions which have support only inside the past light-cone of the point of\nobservation. Second, we show that the Fourier-Bessel expansion of the physical\nfields (including the temperature and polarization momenta) is an alternative\nto the usual Fourier basis as a framework to compute the anisotropies. In that\nexpansion, for each multipole $l$ there is a discrete tower of momenta\n$k_{i,l}$ (not a continuum) which can affect physical observables, with the\nsmallest momenta being $k_{1,l} ~ l$. The Fourier-Bessel modes take into\naccount precisely the information from the sources of anisotropies that\npropagates from the initial value surface to the point of observation - no\nmore, no less. We also show that the physical observables (the temperature and\npolarization maps), and hence the angular power spectra, are unaffected by that\nchoice of basis. This implies that the Fourier-Bessel expansion is the optimal\nscheme with which one can compute CMB anisotropies.

Echelle\nFOCES spectra (R~40000) and Johnson photometry have been performed in 2006.\nSpectral type, rotational velocity, metallicity, and gravity were determined\nusing a code developed by us. The metallicity was measured from the analysis of\niron lines. The spectral subtraction technique was applied to the most relevant\nchromospheric diagnostics included in the FOCES spectral range (CaII IRT,\nHalpha, HeI-D3, Hbeta, CaII H&K). A model with two large high-latitude spots is\nsufficient to reproduce the B/V light curves and the radial velocity\nmodulation, if a temperature difference between photosphere and spots of 1500 K\nis used. A Doppler imaging analysis of photospheric lines confirms a similar\nspot distribution. With the help of an analogous geometric two-spot model, we\nare able to reproduce the modulations in the residual chromospheric emissions\nadopting different values of ratios between the flux of plages and quiet\nchromosphere (5 for Halpha and 3 for CaII). Facular regions of solar type\nappear to be the main responsible for the modulations of chromospheric\ndiagnostics. Both the spot/plage model and the cross-correlation between the\nlight curve and the chromospheric line fluxes display a lead effect of plages\nwith respect to spots (20-40 deg in longitude).
