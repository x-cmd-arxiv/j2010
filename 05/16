The localization of the waveforms is explained\nas the result of the local time slowdown and the Lorentz contraction as a\ndynamic re-shaping of the waveforms in the course of their acceleration. A\ndefinition of mass as a limiting curvature of the spinor-induced metric is\nproposed. A view of the vacuum as a uniformly distributed unit invariant\ndensity of the Dirac field with an explicitly preserved invariance of the light\ncone is brought forward. Qualitative explanation of the observed charge\nasymmetry as the consequence of the dynamics of localization is given. The\norigin of the CP-violation is associated with the loss of the Poincare\ninvariance due to localization. Neutrinos are identified with the signals\nemitted in the abrupt processes of creation or decay of localized objects and\nthe concept of the Majorana neutrino is revisited.

In many cases, the released\nenergy seems to take the form of large numbers of electrons accelerated to high\nenergies or alternatively plasma heated to very high temperatures. The\ntransport of this energy into the remaining portion of the atmosphere results\nin violent mass motion and strong emission across the electromagnetic spectrum.\nOne important phenomenon observed during flares is the appearance in coronal\nmagnetic loops of large amounts of upflowing, soft X-ray emitting plasma. It is\nbelieved that this is due to chromospheric evaporation, the process of heating\ncool chromospheric material beyond its ability to radiate. The pressure\nincrease in the evaporated plasma leads to a number of interesting phenomena in\nthe flare chromosphere. The sudden pressure increase initiates a downward\nmoving \"chromospheric condensation\", an overdense region which gradually\ndecelerates as it accretes material and propagates into the gravitationally\nstratified chromosphere. Solutions to an equation of motion for this\ncondensation shows that its motion decays after about one minute of propagation\ninto the chromosphere. When the front of this downflowing region is supersonic\nrelative to the atmosphere ahead of it, a radiating shock will form. If the\ndownflow is rapid enough, the shock strength should be sufficient to excite UV\nradiation normally associated with the transition region, and furthermore, the\nradiating shock will be brighter than the transition region. These results lead\nto a number of observationally testable relationships between the optical and\nultraviolet spectra from the condensation and radiating shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2010 04:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-18"}

Orthogonal\nFrequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a promising mechanism to\nimplement the agile spectrum access. However, in wireless distributed networks\nwhere tight synchronization is infeasible, OFDMA faces the problem of\ncross-band interference. Subcarriers used by different users are no longer\northogonal, and transmissions operating on non-overlapping subcarriers can\ninterfere with each other. In this paper, we explore the cause of cross-band\ninterference and analytically quantify its strength and impact on packet\ntransmissions. Our analysis captures three key practical artifacts: inter-link\nfrequency offset, temporal sampling mismatch and power heterogeneity. To our\nbest knowledge, this work is the first to systematically analyze the cause and\nimpact of cross-band interference. Using insights from our analysis, we then\nbuild and compared three mitigating methods to combat cross-band interference.\nAnalytical and simulation results show that placing frequency guardband at link\nboundaries is the most effective solution in distributed spectrum sharing,\nwhile the other two frequency-domain methods are sensitive to either temporal\nsampling mismatch or inter-link frequency offset. We find that the proper\nguardband size depends heavily on power heterogeneity. Consequently, protocol\ndesigns for dynamic spectrum access should carefully take into account the\ncross-band interference when configuring spectrum usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2010 09:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In the present paper we study a\ntransition to semi-infinite medium by taking the limit $k\\to \\infty.$\n  The bands of resonances in the complex lower half plane are localized below\nthe band spectrum of the corresponding periodic problem ($k=\\infty$) with $k-1$\nor $k$ resonances in each band. We prove that as $k\\to \\infty$ the resonance\nspectrum converges to the real axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2010 13:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-18"}

The SPIRE images of the Polaris flare reveal for\nthe first time the structure of the diffuse interstellar medium down to 0.01\nparsec over a 10 square degrees region. These exceptional observations\nhighlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellar\nmedium even in diffuse regions of the map. The power spectrum analysis shows\nthat the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a single\npower law with an exponent of -2.7 +- 0.1 at all scales from 30\" to 8 degrees.\nThat the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to the\nSPIRE angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulence\nextends down to the 0.01 pc scale. The power spectrum analysis also allows the\nidentification of a Poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreement\nwith predictions of the cosmic infrared background level at SPIRE wavelengths.\nFinally, the comparison of the SPIRE and IRAS 100 micron data of the Polaris\nflare clearly assesses the capability of SPIRE in maping diffuse emission over\nlarge areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2010 13:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 14:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
