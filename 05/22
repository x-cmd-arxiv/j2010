The brane moves in this higher dimensional space-time under the\ninfluence of its bulk gravity, with dynamics determined by the Nambu action.\nThis introduces the desired interaction between the brane and the gauge field\nin a way that preserves the original gauge invariance as an isometry of the\ninduced metric.

Unlike traditional networks, these\nsensor networks do not have a continuous power supply at their disposal. Rather\nthe individual sensors are battery operated and the lifetime of the individual\nsensors and thus the overall network depend heavily on duty cycle of these\nsensors. Analysis on WSNs shows that communication module is the main part\nwhich consumes most of the sensor energy and that is why energy conservation is\nthe major optimization goal. Since routing protocols and MAC protocols directly\naccess the communication module therefore the design of protocols in these two\ndomains should take into account the energy conservation goal. In this paper,\nwe discuss different state-of-the-art protocols both in MAC and routing domains\nthat have been proposed for WSNs to achieve the overall goal of prolonging the\nnetwork lifetime. The routing protocols in WSNs are generally categorized into\nthree groups - data centric, hierarchical and location-based but we focus on\nonly the first two categories because location-based routing protocols\ngenerally require a prior knowledge about sensors location which most of the\ntimes is not available due to random deployment of the sensors. We then discuss\nhow schedule-based and contention-based MAC protocols can contribute to achieve\noptimal utilization of the limited energy resource by avoiding or reducing the\nchances of collisions and thus the need for retransmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 17:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-24"}

We developed an LGRB synthetic model based on the\nhypothesis that these events originate at the end of the life of massive stars\nfollowing the collapsar model, with the possibility of including a constraint\non the metallicity of the progenitor star. A complete observability pipeline\nwas designed to calculate a probability estimation for a galaxy to be\nobservationally identified as a host for LGRBs detected by present\nobservational facilities. This new tool allows us to build an observable host\ngalaxy catalogue which is required to reproduce the current stellar mass\ndistribution of observed hosts. This observability pipeline predicts that the\nminimum mass for the progenitor stars should be ~75 solar masses in order to be\nable to reproduce BATSE observations. Systems in our observable catalogue are\nable to reproduce the observed properties of host galaxies, namely stellar\nmasses, colours, luminosity, star formation activity and metallicities as a\nfunction of redshift. At z>2, our model predicts that the observable host\ngalaxies would be very similar to the global galaxy population. We found that\n~88 per cent of the observable host galaxies with mean gas metallicity lower\nthan 0.6 solar have stellar masses in the range 10^8.5-10^10.3 solar masses in\nexcellent agreement with observations. Interestingly, in our model observable\nhost galaxies remain mainly within this mass range regardless of redshift,\nsince lower stellar mass systems would have a low probability of being observed\nwhile more massive ones would be too metal-rich.

The main source\nof opacity in these objects is dust grains. We investigate two problems\ninvolving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3, 5, and 7 M_J.\nFirst, we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply\nscale the opacity accordingly. We show that higher metallicity results in\nslower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the\npre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects\nof opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same\nthree planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.\nWhen these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be\nof order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time\nscale calculated without these effects. In this case the time scale is found to\nbe relatively insensitive to planetary mass and composition. However, the\neffects of planetary rotation and accretion of gas and dust, which could\nincrease the timescale, are not included in the calculation.

WISP is\nobtaining slitless, near-infrared grism spectroscopy of ~ 90 independent,\nhigh-latitude fields by observing in the pure parallel mode with Wide Field\nCamera-3 on the Hubble Space Telescope for a total of ~ 250 orbits. Spectra are\nobtained with the G102 (lambda=0.8-1.17 microns, R ~ 210) and G141 grisms\n(lambda=1.11-1.67 microns, R ~ 130), together with direct imaging in the J- and\nH-bands (F110W and F140W, respectively). In the present paper, we present the\nfirst results from 19 WISP fields, covering approximately 63 square arc\nminutes. For typical exposure times (~ 6400 sec in G102 and ~ 2700 sec in\nG141), we reach 5-sigma detection limits for emission lines of 5 x 10^(-17)\nergs s^(-1) cm^(-2) for compact objects. Typical direct imaging 5sigma-limits\nare 26.8 and 25.0 magnitudes (AB) in F110W and F140W, respectively. Restricting\nourselves to the lines measured with highest confidence, we present a list of\n328 emission lines, in 229 objects, in a redshift range 0.3 < z < 3. The\nsingle-line emitters are likely to be a mix of Halpha and [OIII]5007,4959 A,\nwith Halpha predominating. The overall surface density of high-confidence\nemission-line objects in our sample is approximately 4 per arcmin^(2).These\nfirst fields show high equivalent width sources, AGN, and post starburst\ngalaxies. The median observed star formation rate of our Halpha selected sample\nis 4 Msol/year. At intermediate redshifts, we detect emission lines in galaxies\nas faint as H_140 ~ 25, or M_R < -19, and are sensitive to star formation rates\ndown to less than 1 Msol/year. The slitless grisms on WFC3 provide a unique\nopportunity to study the spectral properties of galaxies much fainter than L*\nat the peak of the galaxy assembly epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2010 20:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Problems quantizing general\nrelativity because it is not renormalizable have led to a search for a new\ntheory of gravity that, while still agreeing with measured observations, is\nrenormalizable. In this paper, a spin-1 Yang-Mills force theory with a SO(4,1)\nor {\\em de Sitter} group symmetry is developed. By deriving the standard\ngeodesic equation and the first post-Newtonian approximation equations, it is\nshown that this theory, coupled to Dirac fields, predicts all N-body and light\nobservations of gravitational phenomena to within experimental accuracy.\nFurthermore, because of the separation of gauge covariance from coordinate\ndiffeomorphism, the theory satisfies the strong equivalence principle while\nmaintaining a Minkowski coordinate metric. Cosmology is also briefly addressed:\nVacuum energy is the most common explanation for the accelerating expansion of\nthe universe but suffers from the drawback that any reasonable prediction of it\nis 120 orders of magnitude too large. The de Sitter solution to the Einstein\nField Equations is an alternative to vacuum energy as an explanation for the\naccelerating expansion of the universe but only if the universe is\napproximately a vacuum. The proposed gauge theory, however, avoids both these\nproblems and, cosmologically, the accelerating expansion of the universe is\nshown as a consequence of the de Sitter group Lie algebra.

In\naddition, once learned, an offline detector can not make use of newly arriving\ndata. To alleviate these drawbacks, online learning has been adopted with the\nfollowing objectives: (1) the technique should be computationally and storage\nefficient; (2) the updated classifier must maintain its high classification\naccuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient framework for\nlearning an adaptive online greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (GSLDA)\nmodel.

The\nstatistics $S_3$ resulting from our campaign of 2005 -- 2007 at Maidanak\nobservatory is presented. It is shown that these data can be used to estimate\nhigh-altitude winds at pressure level 70 -- 100 mbar. Comparison with the wind\nspeed retrieved from the NCEP/NCAR global models shows a good agreement. Some\nprospects for retrieval of the wind speed profile from the MASS measurements\nare outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 14:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

It is\nnatural to ask whether the classical Hamiltonian (with both the orbital and\nspin parts) is consistent with that in the relativistic quantum theory for a\nspin-1/2 charged particle, which is described by the Dirac equation. In the\nlow-energy limit, up to terms of the 7th order in $1/E_g$ ($E_g=2mc^2$ and $m$\nis the particle mass), we investigate the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation\nof the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of homogeneous and static\nelectromagnetic fields and show that it is indeed in agreement with the\nclassical Hamiltonian with the gyromagnetic ratio being equal to 2. Through\nelectromagnetic duality, this result can be generalized for a spin-1/2 dyon,\nwhich has both electric and magnetic charges and thus possesses both intrinsic\nelectric and magnetic dipole moments. Furthermore, the relativistic quantum\ntheory for a spin-1/2 dyon with arbitrary values of the gyromagnetic and\ngyroelectric ratios can be described by the Dirac-Pauli equation, which is the\nDirac equation with augmentation for the anomalous electric and anomalous\nmagnetic dipole moments. The FW transformation of the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian\nis shown, up to the 7th order again, to be also in accord with the classical\nHamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 14:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}
