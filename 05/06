Molecular clouds associated with SNRs can produce gamma-ray\nemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentrated\ngas. The middle aged SNR W28, for its associated system of dense molecular\nclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. We present\nthe AGILE/GRID observations of SNR W28, and compare them with observations at\nother wavelengths (TeV and 12CO J=1-->0 molecular line emission). The gamma-ray\nflux detected by AGILE from the dominant source associated with W28 is (14 +-\n5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for E > 400 MeV. This source is positionally well\ncorrelated with the TeV emission observed by the HESS telescope. The local\nvariations of the GeV to TeV flux ratio suggest a difference between the CR\nspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. A model based on\na hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds at\ndifferent distances from the W28 shell can explain both the morphological and\nspectral features observed by AGILE in the MeV-GeV energy range and by the HESS\ntelescope in the TeV energy range. The combined set of AGILE and H.E.S.S. data\nstrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in W28.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 16:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-16"}

We concentrate on the scenario where the scalar\nfield, as the result of contraction of the universe, is driven from the bottom\nof the potential well. The field is amplified, and finally the phase of the\nstandard slow-roll inflation is realized. Such an evolution modifies the\nstandard inflationary spectrum of perturbations by the additional oscillations\nand damping on the large scales. We extract the parameters of the model from\nthe observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In particular,\nthe value of inflaton mass is equal to $m=(2.6 \\pm 0.6) \\cdot 10^{13}$ GeV. In\nour considerations we base on the seven years of observations made by the WMAP\nsatellite.

We also use all\ncontemporaneous data from RXTE, XMM, Swift and Suzaku. We find a linear\ncorrelation between the medium and hard-energy X-ray fluxes measured by\nINTEGRAL, which indicates an almost constant spectral index over six years. The\nmajority of INTEGRAL observations were made when the source was either at a\nvery bright or very dim hard--X-ray state. We find that thermal Comptonization\nmodels applied to the bright state yields the plasma temperature of 50--70 keV\nand its optical depth of 1.3--2.6, depending on the assumed source geometry.\nFor the dim state, these parameters are in the ranges of 180--230 keV and\n0.3--0.7, respectively. The Compton parameter is y = 1 for all the spectra,\nindicating a stable geometry. Using this result, we can determine the\nreflection effective solid angles associated with the close and distant\nreprocessing media as = 0.3 x 2pi and 0.2 x 2pi, respectively. The plasma\nenergy balance, the weak disc reflection and a comparison of the UV fluxes\nilluminating the plasma to the observed ones are all consistent with an inner\nhot accretion surrounded by an outer cold disc. The disc truncation radius can\nbe determined from an approximate equipartition between the observed UV and\nX-ray emission, and from the fitted disc blackbody model, as 15 gravitational\nradii. Alternatively, our results can be explained by a mildly relativistic\ncoronal outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 20:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 20:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We use a cosmological\nsimulation, as well as an analytical model, to investigate how and why the\nscaling relations for BHs evolve with cosmic time. We find that a simulation\nthat reproduces the observed redshift zero relations between m_BH and the\nproperties of its host galaxy, as well as the thermodynamic profiles of the\nintragroup medium, also reproduces the observed evolution in the ratio m_BH/m_s\nfor massive galaxies, although the evolution of the m_BH/sigma relation is in\napparent conflict with observations.

In\norder to describe the effects of Lorentz transformations on the entangled\nstates, quantum mechanics and special relativity are merged by construction of\nthe unitary irreducible representations of Poincar{\\'e} group on the infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space of state vectors. In this framework, the issue of\nfinding the unitary irreducible representations of Poincar{\\'e} group is\nreduced to that of the little group. Wigner rotation for the massive particles\nplays a crucial role due to its effect on the spin polarization directions.\nFurthermore, the physical requirements for constructing the correct\nrelativistic spin operator is also studied. Then, the entanglement and Bell\ntype inequalities are reviewed. Special attention has been devoted to two\nhistorical papers, by EPR in 1935 and by J.S. Bell in 1964. The main part of\nthe thesis is based on the Lorentz transformation of the Bell states and the\nBell inequalities on these transformed states. It is shown that entanglement is\na Lorentz invariant quantity. That is, no inertial observer can see the\nentangled state as a separable one. However, it was shown that the Bell\ninequality may be satisfied for the Wigner angle dependent transformed\nentangled states. Since the Wigner rotation changes the spin polarization\ndirection with the increased velocity, initial dichotomous operators can\nsatisfy the Bell inequality for those states. By choosing the dichotomous\noperators taking into consideration the Wigner angle, it is always possible to\nshow that Bell type inequalities can be violated for the transformed entangled\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 20:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 22:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This intermediate\nphase persists over the widest temperature range in the stripe state when the\nlocal particle lattice within an individual stripe melts well below the\ntemperature at which the entire stripe structure breaks down, and is\ncharacterized by intra-stripe diffusion of particles without inter-stripe\ndiffusion. This is followed at higher temperatures by the onset of inter-stripe\ndiffusion in an anisotropic diffusion phase, and then by breakup of the stripe\nstructure.

The model incorporates a description of the\nangular momentum transfer between the star and disk due to a magnetic\nconnection, and includes changes in the star's mass and radius and a decreasing\naccretion rate. The model also includes, for the first time in a spin evolution\nmodel, the opening of the stellar magnetic field lines, as expected to arise\nfrom twisting via star-disk differential rotation. In order to isolate the\neffect that this has on the star-disk interaction torques, we neglect the\ninfluence of torques that may arise from open field regions connected to the\nstar or disk. For a range of magnetic field strengths, accretion rates, and\ninitial spin rates, we compute the stellar spin rates of pre-main-sequence\nstars as they evolve on the Hayashi track to an age of 3~Myr. How much the\nfield opening affects the spin depends on the strength of the coupling of the\nmagnetic field to the disk. For the relatively strong coupling (i.e., high\nmagnetic Reynolds number) expected in real systems, all models predict spin\nperiods of less than $\\sim3$ days, in the age range of 1--3~Myr. Furthermore,\nthese systems typically do not reach an equilibrium spin rate within 3~Myr, so\nthat the spin at any given time depends upon the choice of initial spin rate.\nThis corroborates earlier suggestions that, in order to explain the full range\nof observed rotation periods of approximately $1$--$10$ days, additional\nprocesses, such as the angular momentum loss from powerful stellar winds, are\nnecessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 22:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For network planners\nwho are deploying VoIP over WLANs, one of the important issues is the VoIP\ncapacity. VoIP bandwidth consumption over a WAN is one of the most important\nfactors to consider when building a VoIP infrastructure. Failure to account for\nVoIP bandwidth requirements will severely limit the reliability of a VoIP\nsystem and place a huge burden on the WAN infrastructure. Less bandwidth\nutilization is the key reasons for reduced number of channel accesses in VOIP.\nBut in the QoS point of view the free bandwidth of atleast 1-5% will improve\nthe voice quality. This proposal utilizes the maximum bandwidth by leaving 1-5%\nfree bandwidth. A Bandwidth Data rate Moderation (BDM) algorithm has been\nproposed which correlates the data rate specified in IEEE802.11b with the free\nbandwidth. At each time BDM will calculate the bandwidth utilization before\nsending the packet to improve performance and voice quality of VoIP. The\nbandwidth calculation in BDM can be done by using Erlang and VOIP bandwidth\ncalculator. Finally, ns2 experimental study shows the relationship between\nbandwidth utilization, free bandwidth and data rate. The paper concludes that\nmarginal VoIP call rate has been increased by BDM algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 09:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-07"}

The\nalgorithmic approach is well-suited to the problems that are well-understood\nand known solution(s). On the other hand the ANNs have learning by example and\nprocessing capabilities similar to that of a human brain.

In high magnification events, the lens\ncaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of the\nangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limb\ndarkening. When such extended-source effects appear close to maximum\nmagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristic\nPaczynski point-source curve. The exact shape of the light curve close to the\npeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. Dense photometric coverage\npermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. In the case\nof microlensing event OGLE 2008-BLG-290, the K giant source star reached a peak\nmagnification of about 100. Thirteen different telescopes have covered this\nevent in eight different photometric bands. Subsequent light-curve analysis\nyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in six\nphotometric bands. The best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of the\nsource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 K.

As the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the CTIO/SMARTS2 V and\nI bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs to\nbe understood.

These extensions include extension to accelerated observers,\nrelativistic dynamics and general relativity; however, its main subject is the\nextension to accelerated observers (AccRel). One surprising result is that\nnatural extension to accelerated observers is not enough if we want our theory\nto imply certain experimental facts, such as the twin paradox. Even if we add\nthe whole first-order theory of real numbers to this natural extension, it is\nstill not enough to imply the twin paradox. Nevertheless, that does not mean\nthat this task cannot be carried out within first-order logic since by\napproximating a second-order logic axiom of real numbers, we introduce a\nfirst-order axiom schema that solves the problem. Our theory AccRel nicely\nfills the gap between special and general relativity theories, and only one\nnatural generalization step is needed to achieve a first-order logic\naxiomatization of general relativity from it. We also show that AccRel is\nstrong enough to make predictions about the gravitational effect slowing down\ntime. Our general aims are to axiomatize relativity theories within pure\nfirst-order logic using simple, comprehensible and transparent basic\nassumptions (axioms); to prove the surprising predictions (theorems) of\nrelativity theories from a few convincing axioms; to eliminate tacit\nassumptions from relativity by replacing them with explicit axioms formulated\nin first-order logic (in the spirit of the first-order logic foundation of\nmathematics and Tarski's axiomatization of geometry); and to investigate the\nrelationship between the axioms and the theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 10:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-07"}

We investigate the\nprojected rotational velocities vsini of a sample of young stars with respect\nto the stellar mass and disk evolutionary state to search for possible\nindications of disk-braking mechanisms. We analyse the stellar spectra of 220\nnearby (mostly <100pc) young (2-600 Myr) stars for their vsini, stellar age,\nHalpha emission, and accretion rates. The stars have been observed with FEROS\nand HARPS in La Silla, Chile. The spectra have been cross-correlated with\nappropriate theoretical templates.

The vsini is then analysed with respect\nto the evolutionary state of the circumstellar disks to search for indications\nof disk-braking mechanisms in accretors.

However, current quantitative spectroscopic techniques require\nspectral resolutions of R>17,000, making observations of RSGs at distances\ngreater than 1Mpc unfeasible. Here we explore the potential of quantitative\nspectroscopic techniques at much lower resolutions, R ~2-3000. We take archival\nJ-band spectra of a sample of RSGs in the Solar neighbourhood. In this spectral\nregion the metallic lines of FeI, MgI, SiI and TiI are prominent, while the\nmolecular absorption features of OH, H_2O, CN and CO are weak. We compare these\ndata with synthetic spectra produced from the existing grid of model\natmospheres from the MARCS project, with the aim of deriving chemical\nabundances. We find that all stars studied can be unambiguously fit by the\nmodels, and model parameters of log g, effective temperatures Teff,\nmicroturbulence and global metal content may be derived. We find that the\nabundances derived for the stars are all very close to Solar and have low\ndispersion, with an average of [logZ]=0.13+/-0.14. The values of Teff fit by\nthe models are ~150K cooler than the stars' literature values for earlier\nspectral types when using the Levesque et al. temperature scale, though this\ntemperature discrepancy has very little systematic effect on the derived\nabundances as the equivalent widths (EWs) of the metallic lines are roughly\nconstant across the full temperature range of RSGs. Instead, elemental\nabundances are the dominating factor in the EWs of the diagnostic lines. Our\nresults suggest that chemical abundance measurements of RSGs are possible at\nlow- to medium-resolution, meaning that this technique is a viable\ninfrared-based alternative to measuring abundance trends in external galaxies.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 14:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
