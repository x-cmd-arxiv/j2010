The behaviour of all three MHD wave modes, i.e. the\nAlfven wave and the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves, has been investigated\nin the neighbourhood of 2D, 2.5D and (to a certain extent) 3D magnetic null\npoints, for a variety of assumptions, configurations and geometries. In\ngeneral, it is found that the fast magnetoacoustic wave behaviour is dictated\nby the Alfven-speed profile. In a $\\beta=0$ plasma, the fast wave is focused\ntowards the null point by a refraction effect and all the wave energy, and thus\ncurrent density, accumulates close to the null point. Thus, null points will be\nlocations for preferential heating by fast waves. Independently, the Alfven\nwave is found to propagate along magnetic fieldlines and is confined to the\nfieldlines it is generated on. As the wave approaches the null point, it\nspreads out due to the diverging fieldlines. Eventually, the Alfven wave\naccumulates along the separatrices (in 2D) or along the spine or fan-plane (in\n3D). Hence, Alfven wave energy will be preferentially dissipated at these\nlocations. It is clear that the magnetic field plays a fundamental role in the\npropagation and properties of MHD waves in the neighbourhood of coronal null\npoints. This topic is a fundamental plasma process and results so far have also\nlead to critical insights into reconnection, mode-coupling, quasi-periodic\npulsations and phase-mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 16:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 12:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-30"}

The optoelectronic components have\nbeen designed to meet the stringent requirements of a HEP experiment in terms\nof radiation hardness, low mass and low power. Extensive testing has been\nperformed on the components and on complete optical links in test systems.\nTheir functionality and performance in terms of gain, noise, linearity,\nbandwidth and radiation hardness is detailed. Particular emphasis is placed on\nthe gain, which directly affects the dynamic range of the detector data. It has\nbeen possible to accurately predict the variation in gain that will be observed\nthroughout the system. A simulation based on production test data showed that\nthe average gain would be ~38% higher than the design target at the Tracker\noperating temperature of -10{\\deg}C. Corrective action was taken to reduce the\ngains and recover the lost dynamic range by lowering the optical receiver's\nload resistor value from 100{\\Omega} to 62{\\Omega}. All links will have gains\nbetween 0.64 and 0.96V/V. The future iteration of CMS will be operated in an\nupgraded LHC requiring faster data readout. In order to preserve the large\ninvestments made for the current readout system, an upgrade path that involves\nreusing the existing optoelectronic components is considered. The applicability\nof Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in a HEP readout system is examined.\nThe method for calculating the data rate is presented, along with laboratory\ntests where QAM signals were transmitted over a Tracker optical link.

Results: We have detected H2O, CH3OH, and OH maser emission\nclustered within 2000 AU from the center of a flattened HMC, oriented SE-NW,\nfrom which emerges a massive 12CO outflow, elongated NE-SW, extended up to the\npc-scale. Although the three maser species show a clearly different spatial and\nvelocity distribution and sample distinct environments around the massive YSO,\nthe spatial symmetry and velocity field of each maser specie can be explained\nin terms of expansion from a common center, which possibly denotes the position\nof the YSO driving the maser motion. Water masers trace both a fast shock (up\nto 50 km/s) closer to the YSO, powered by a wide-angle wind, and a slower (20\nkm/s) bipolar jet, at the base of the large-scale outflow. Since the compact\nfree-free emission is found offset from the putative location of the YSO along\na direction consistent with that of the maser jet axis, we interpret the radio\ncontinuum in terms of a thermal jet. The velocity field of methanol masers can\nbe explained in terms of a composition of slow (4 km/s in amplitude) motions of\nradial expansion and rotation about an axis approximately parallel to the maser\njet. Finally, the distribution of line of sight velocities of the hydroxyl\nmasers suggests that they can trace gas less dense (n(H2) < 10^6 cm^-3) and\nmore distant from the YSO than that traced by the water and methanol masers,\nwhich is expanding toward the observer.

The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple\nthe vertical structure from the radial direction.

Local galaxies define a tight surface in this 3D space, the\nFundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), with a small residual dispersion of\n~0.05 dex in metallicity, i.e, ~12%. At low stellar mass, metallicity decreases\nsharply with increasing SFR, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not\ndepend on SFR. High redshift galaxies, up to z~2.5 are found to follow the same\nFMR defined by local SDSS galaxies, with no indication of evolution. The\nevolution of the mass-metallicity relation observed up to z=2.5 is due to the\nfact that galaxies with progressively higher SFRs, and therefore lower\nmetallicities, are selected at increasing redshifts, sampling different parts\nof the same FMR. By introducing the new quantity mu_alpha=log(M*)-alpha\nlog(SFR), with alpha=0.32, we define a projection of the FMR that minimizes the\nmetallicity scatter of local galaxies. The same quantity also cancels out any\nredshift evolution up to z~2.5, i.e, all galaxies have the same range of values\nof mu_0.32. At z>2.5, evolution of about 0.6 dex off the FMR is observed, with\nhigh-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. The existence of the FMR\ncan be explained by the interplay of infall of pristine gas and outflow of\nenriched material. The former effect is responsible for the dependence of\nmetallicity with SFR and is the dominant effect at high-redshift, while the\nlatter introduces the dependence on stellar mass and dominates at low redshift.\nThe combination of these two effects, together with the Schmidt-Kennicutt law,\nexplains the shape of the FMR and the role of mu_0.32. The small metallicity\nscatter around the FMR supports the smooth infall scenario of gas accretion in\nthe local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 20:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 09:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 14:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We use a sample of 16,000 quiescent galaxies from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey to map out variations in Mdyn/L through the 3D\nFundamental Plane space defined by velocity dispersion (sigma), effective\nradius (R_e), and effective surface brightness. We consider contributions to\nMdyn/L variation due to stellar population effects, IMF variations, and\nvariations in the dark matter fraction within one R_e. Along the FP, we find\nthat the stellar population contribution scales as M*/L ~ f(sigma), while the\ndark matter and/or IMF contribution scales as Mdyn/M* ~ g(Mdyn). The two\ncontributions to the tilt of the FP rotate the plane around different axes in\nthe 3D space, with dark matter/IMF variations likely dominating. Through the\nthickness of the FP, we find that Mdyn/L variations must be dominated either by\nIMF variations or by real differences in dark matter fraction with R_e. Thus\nthe finite thickness of the FP is due to variations in the stellar mass surface\ndensity within R_e, not the fading of passive stellar populations. These\nstructural variations are correlated with galaxy star formation histories such\nthat galaxies with higher Mdyn/M* at a given sigma have higher [Mg/Fe], lower\nmetallicities, and older mean stellar ages. It is difficult to explain the\nobserved correlations by allowing the IMF to vary, suggesting difference in\ndark matter fraction dominate. These can be produced by variations in the\n\"conversion efficiency\" of baryons into stars or by the redistribution of stars\nand dark matter through dissipational merging. A model in which some galaxies\nexperience low conversion efficiencies due to premature truncation of star\nformation provides a natural explanation for the observed trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 20:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In particular, in the so-called\n`underdoped' region, the overall behavior of superconductivity deviates\n$qualitatively$ from the standard theoretical description pioneered by Bardeen,\nCooper and Schrieffer (BCS). Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of\nthe superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various\nexperiments. However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the\nsurprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.\nHere, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple,\nsolvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the\nsuperconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a\nspecial dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes.

Furthermore, a striking mass\ndivergence is predicted that dictates the occurrence of the observed quantum\ncritical point. Our model produces properties of the superfluid in good\nagreement with the experiments, and provides new insights into several current\npuzzles.

And\nlocal energy densities, obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, $\\langle T_{00}\\rangle$, typically diverge near\nboundaries. The energy of interaction between distinct rigid bodies of whatever\ntype is finite, corresponding to observable forces and torques between the\nbodies, which can be unambiguously calculated. The self-energy of a body is\nless well-defined, and suffers divergences which may or may not be removable.\nSome examples where a unique total self-stress may be evaluated include the\nperfectly conducting spherical shell first considered by Boyer, a perfectly\nconducting cylindrical shell, and dilute dielectric balls and cylinders. In\nthese cases the finite part is unique, yet there are divergent contributions\nwhich may be subsumed in some sort of renormalization of physical parameters.\nThe divergences that occur in the local energy-momentum tensor near surfaces\nare distinct from the divergences in the total energy, which are often\nassociated with energy located exactly on the surfaces. However, the local\nenergy-momentum tensor couples to gravity, so what is the significance of\ninfinite quantities here? For the classic situation of parallel plates there\nare indications that the divergences in the local energy density are consistent\nwith divergences in Einstein's equations; correspondingly, it has been shown\nthat divergences in the total Casimir energy serve to precisely renormalize the\nmasses of the plates, in accordance with the equivalence principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 23:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The close proximity\nof the Magellanic Clouds allows us to probe the nature of these star forming\nregions at small spatial scales. We aim to determine the monochromatic IR band\nthat most accurately traces the bolometric IR flux (TIR), which can then be\nused to estimate an obscured SFR. We present the spatial analysis, via\naperture/annulus photometry, of 16 LMC and 16 SMC HII region complexes using\nthe Spitzer IRAC and MIPS bands. UV rocket data and SHASSA H-alpha data are\nalso included. We find that nearly all of the LMC and SMC HII region SEDs peak\naround 70um, from ~10 to ~400 pc from the central sources. As a result, the\nsizes of HII regions as probed by 70um is approximately equal to the sizes as\nprobed by TIR (about 70 pc in radius); the radial profile of the 70um flux,\nnormalized by TIR, is constant at all radii (70um ~ 0.45 TIR); the 1-sigma\nstandard deviation of the 70um fluxes, normalized by TIR, is a lower fraction\nof the mean (0.05 to 0.12 out to ~220 pc) than the normalized 8, 24, and 160um\nnormalized fluxes (0.12 to 0.52); and these results are invariant between the\nLMC and SMC. From these results, we argue that 70um is the most suitable IR\nband to use as a monochromatic obscured star formation indicator because it\nmost accurately reproduces the TIR of HII regions in the LMC and SMC and over\nlarge spatial scales. We also explore the general trends of the 8, 24, 70, and\n160um bands in the LMC and SMC HII region SEDs, radial surface brightness\nprofiles, sizes, and normalized (by TIR) radial flux profiles. We derive an\nobscured SFR equation that is modified from the literature to use 70um\nluminosity, SFR(Mo/yr) = 9.7(0.7)x10^{-44} L(70)(ergs/s), which is applicable\nfrom 10 to 300 pc distance from the center of an HII region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 01:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-21"}

There are four major orbit families; one of these, the pyramid\norbits, have the interesting property that they can approach arbitrarily\nclosely to the BH. We derive the orbit-averaged equations of motion and show\nthat in the limit of weak triaxiality, the pyramid orbits are integrable: the\nmotion consists of a two-dimensional libration of the major axis of the orbit\nabout the short axis of the triaxial figure, with eccentricity varying as a\nfunction of the two orientation angles, and reaching unity at the corners.\nBecause pyramid orbits occupy the lowest angular momentum regions of phase\nspace, they compete with collisional loss cone repopulation and with resonant\nrelaxation in supplying matter to BHs. General relativistic advance of the\nperiapse dominates the precession for sufficiently eccentric orbits, and we\nshow that relativity imposes an upper limit to the eccentricity: roughly the\nvalue at which the relativistic precession time is equal to the time for\ntorques to change the angular momentum. We argue that this upper limit to the\neccentricity should apply also to evolution driven by resonant relaxation, with\npotentially important consequences for the rate of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals\nin low-luminosity galaxies. In giant galaxies, we show that capture of stars on\npyramid orbits can dominate the feeding of BHs, at least until such a time as\nthe pyramid orbits are depleted; however this time can be of order a Hubble\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 02:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 00:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-09"}

Compared with the known\nprotocols for fully-simulatable oblivious transfer that works in the plain mode\n(where there is no trusted common reference string available) and proven to be\nsecure under standard model (where there is no random oracle available), the\ninstantiation based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption of the\nframework is the most efficient one, no matter seen from communication rounds\nor computational overhead.\n  Our framework uses three abstract tools, i.e., perfectly binding commitment,\nperfectly hiding commitment and our new smooth projective hash. This allows a\nsimple and intuitive understanding of its security.\n  We instantiate the new smooth projective hash under the lattice assumption,\nthe decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, the decisional $N$-th residuosity\nassumption, the decisional quadratic residuosity assumption. This indeed shows\nthat the folklore that it is technically difficult to instantiate the\nprojective hash framework under the lattice assumption is not true. What's\nmore, by using this lattice-based hash and lattice-based commitment scheme, we\ngain a concrete protocol for $OT^{n}_{h}$ which is secure against quantum\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 03:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jan 2011 15:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 00:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

At the\nphoton-baryon decoupling epoch, the universe may be assumed to be dominated by\nnon-relativistic matter, and thus we may treat radiation as a test field in the\nuniverse filled with dust which is described by the Lema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi\n(LTB) solution. First, we give an LTB model whose distance-redshift relation\nagrees with that of the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model in the whole redshift\ndomain and which is well approximated by the Einstein-de Sitter universe at and\nbefore decoupling. We determine the decoupling epoch in this LTB universe by\nGamow's criterion and then calculate the positions of acoustic peaks. Thus\nobtained results are not consistent with the WMAP data. However, we find that\none can fit the peak positions by appropriately modifying the LTB model,\nnamely, by allowing the deviation of the distance-redshift relation from that\nof the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model at $z>2$ where no observational data are\navailable at present. Thus there is still a possibility of explaining the\napparent accelerated expansion of the universe by inhomogeneity without\nresorting to dark energy if we abandon the Copernican principle. Even if we do\nnot take this extreme attitude, it also suggests that local, isotropic\ninhomogeneities around us may seriously affect the determination of the density\ncontents of the universe unless the possible existence of such inhomogeneities\nis properly taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 06:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 08:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2010 09:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

In this paper, we propose HyberLoc, an algorithm that\nprovides anchor physical layer location privacy in anchor-based hybrid sensor\nnetworks. The idea is for anchor nodes to dynamically change their transmission\npower following a certain probability distribution, degrading the localization\naccuracy at un-trusted nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy at\ntrusted nodes. Given an average power constraint, our analysis shows that the\ndiscretized exponential distribution is the distribution that maximizes\nlocation uncertainty at the untrusted nodes. Detailed evaluation through\nanalysis, simulation, and implementation shows that HyberLoc gives trusted\nnodes up to 3.5 times better localization accuracy as compared to untrusted\nnodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 13:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The\nlinewidth of radiation is much smaller than expected from the quality factor of\nthe cavity mode excited. Thus, an additional mechanism of synchronization seems\nto play a role, possibly arising from nonequilibrium processes at the hot spot\nedge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 15:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

One\nof the main advantages of analysing a cryptographic protocol in the game-theory\nsetting is the possibility of describing improved and stronger cryptographic\nsolutions because possible adversarial behaviours may be taken into account\ndirectly. With those tools, protocols can be studied in a malicious model in\norder to find equilibrium conditions that make possible to protect honest\nparties against all possible strategies of adversaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2010 15:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Unlike O($N$) methods developed so far the approach is a\nnumerically exact alternative to conventional O($N^{3}$) diagonalization\nschemes in spite of the low-order scaling, and can be applicable to not only\ninsulating but also metallic systems in a single framework.
