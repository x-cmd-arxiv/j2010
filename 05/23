For the 11 X-class flares where vector\nmagnetograms are available, we always find an increase of transverse field at\nthe polarity inversion line (PIL) although only 4 events had measurements with\n1 minute temporal resolution. We also discuss 18 events with 1 minute cadence\nline-of-sight magnetogram observation, which all show prominent changes of\nmagnetic flux contained in the flaring Delta spot region. Except in one case,\nthe observed limb-ward flux increases while disk-ward flux decreases rapidly\nand irreversibly after flares. This observational evidence provides support,\neither directly or indirectly, for the theory and prediction of Hudson, Fisher\n& Welsch that the photospheric magnetic fields must respond to coronal field\nrestructuring and turn to a more horizontal state near the PIL after eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 16:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Moreover, it was shown in \\cite{ADMSS95,NS07}\nthat for any $k \\ge 4$, one can build in $O(n (\\log n) 2^k \\alpha_k(n))$ time a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with diameter at most $2k$ and $O(n 2^k \\alpha_k(n))$\nedges. The function $\\alpha_k$ is the inverse of a certain function at the\n$\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$th level of the primitive recursive hierarchy, where\n$\\alpha_0(n) = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil, \\alpha_1(n) = \\left\\lceil \\sqrt{n}\n\\right\\rceil, \\alpha_2(n) = \\lceil \\log{n} \\rceil, \\alpha_3(n) = \\lceil\n\\log\\log{n} \\rceil, \\alpha_4(n) = \\log^* n$, \\ldots, etc. It is also known\n\\cite{NS07} that if one allows quadratic time then these bounds can be\nimproved. Specifically, for any $k \\ge 4$, a $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with\ndiameter at most $k$ and $O(n k \\alpha_k(n))$ edges can be constructed in\n$O(n^2)$ time \\cite{NS07}.\n  A major open problem in this area is whether one can construct within time\n$O(n \\log n + n k \\alpha_k(n))$ a $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with diameter at most\n$k$ and $O(n k \\alpha_k(n))$ edges. In this paper we answer this question in\nthe affirmative. Moreover, in fact, we provide a stronger result. Specifically,\nwe show that for any $k \\ge 4$, a $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with diameter at most\n$k$ and $O(n \\alpha_k(n))$ edges can be built in optimal time $O(n \\log n)$.\nThe tradeoff between the diameter and number of edges of our spanners is tight\nup to constant factors in the entire range of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 23:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-31"}

We find that the radio power drops\nrapidly after the stopping of the jet, with a shorter time-scale than the X-ray\npower.
