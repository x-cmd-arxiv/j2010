In this work, we consider simple models to examine the effect\nof symmetries of delocalized multi-excitation states on the dynamical\ntimescales, including hopping rates, radiative decay, and environmental\ninteractions. While the decoherence (pure dephasing) rate of an extended state\nover N sites is comparable to that of a non-extended state, superradiance leads\nto a factor of N enhancement in decay and absorption rates. In addition to\nsuperradiance, we illustrate how the multi-excitonic states exhibit\n`supertransfer' in the far-field regime: hopping from a symmetrized state over\nN sites to a symmetrized state over M sites at a rate proportional to MN. We\nargue that such symmetries could play an operational role in physical systems\nbased on the competition between symmetry-enhanced interactions and localized\ninhomogeneities and environmental interactions that destroy symmetry. As an\nexample, we propose that supertransfer and coherent hopping play a role in\nrecent observations of anomolously long diffusion lengths in nano-engineered\nassembly of light-harvesting complexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 17:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

Both biotic interactions and\nenvironmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt\ncoexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic\nand stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear\ntheory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and\ndifferential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a\nfixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this\nweighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any\n(ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of\npopulations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth\nrate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is\nsufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique\npositive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence\ncriterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this\ntheory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits\ncoexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on\ncorrelations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation\nin mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time\nLotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic\ndiversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 17:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-26"}

The prestellar core mass function (CMF) derived for the Aquila\nregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (IMF),\nalready confirming the close connection between the CMF and the IMF with much\nbetter statistics than earlier studies. Comparing and contrasting our Herschel\nresults in Aquila and Polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenario\nfor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filaments\nform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragment\ninto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 19:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 18:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The former are perfectly entrained with the gas and set the opacity in\nthe disk, while the latter are allowed to respond to gas drag forces, with the\nback reaction on the gas taken into account.

We show that (1) disk instability planets have the potential\nto form large cores due to aerodynamic capturing of rock-size solids in spiral\narms before fragmentation; (2) that temporary clumps can concentrate tens of\n$M_{\\oplus}$ of solids in very localized regions before clump disruption; (3)\nthat the formation of permanent clumps, even in the outer disk, is dependent on\nthe grain-size distribution, i.e., the opacity; (4) that nonaxisymmetric\nstructure in the disk can create disk regions that have a solids-to-gas ratio\ngreater than unity; (5) that the solid distribution may affect the\nfragmentation process; (6) that proto-gas giants and proto-brown dwarfs can\nstart as differentiated objects prior to the H$_2$ collapse phase; (7) that\nspiral arms in a gravitationally unstable disk are able to stop the inward\ndrift of rock-size solids, even redistributing them to larger radii; and, (8)\nthat large solids can form spiral arms that are offset from the gaseous spiral\narms.

It can thus give information on the\nstar formation history of the universe. However, it is difficult to measure\ndirectly due to foreground radiation fields from the Galaxy and solar system.\nGamma-rays from extragalactic sources at cosmological distances (blazars and\ngamma-ray bursts) interact with EBL photons creating electron-positron pairs,\nabsorbing the gamma-rays. Given the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum of a source\nand its redshift, the EBL can in principle be measured. However, the intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectra of blazars and GRBs can vary considerably from source to\nsource and the from the same source over short timescales. A maximum intrinsic\nspectrum can be assumed from theoretical grounds, to give upper limits on the\nEBL absorption from blazars at low redshift with very high energy (VHE)\ngamma-ray observations with ground-based Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The\nFermi-LAT observations of blazars and GRBs can probe EBL absorption at higher\nredshifts. The lower energy portion of the LAT spectrum of these sources is\nunattenuated by the EBL, so that extrapolating this to higher energies can give\nthe maximum intrinsic spectrum for a source. Comparing this to the observed\nhigher energy LAT spectrum will then give upper limits on the EBL absorption.\nFor blazars which have been detected by both the Fermi-LAT and at higher\nenergies by Cherenkov telescopes, combined LAT-VHE observations can put more\nstringent constraints on the low redshift EBL. These procedures above can also\nbe reversed: for sources with an unknown redshift, a given EBL model and\ngamma-ray spectrum can lead to an upper limit on the source's redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 20:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

We used a systematic\ndetection technique operating simultaneously on all Herschel bands to build a\nsample of protostars. Spectral energy distributions are derived to measure\nluminosities and envelope masses, and to place the protostars in an M_env -\nL_bol evolutionary diagram. The spatial distribution of protostars indicates\nthree star-forming sites in Aquila, with W40/Sh2-64 HII region by far the\nrichest. Most of the detected protostars are newly discovered. For a reduced\narea around the Serpens South cluster, we could compare the Herschel census of\nprotostars with Spitzer results. The Herschel protostars are younger than in\nSpitzer with 7 Class 0 YSOs newly revealed by Herschel. For the entire Aquila\nfield, we find a total of ~ 45-60 Class 0 YSOs discovered by Herschel. This\nconfirms the global statistics of several hundred Class~0 YSOs that should be\nfound in the whole Gould Belt survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 21:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We consider here the about 1400 stars on the Red Giant Branch (RGB)\nobserved with FLAMES@VLT in 19 Galactic GCs, part of out Na-O anticorrelation\nprojet. Stars with different He are expected to have different temperatures\n(i.e. colours), slightly different [Fe/H], and different luminosity levels of\nthe RGB bump. All these differences are small, but our study has the necessary\nprecision, good statistics, and homogeneity to detect them. We also computed\nsuitable sets of stellar models (BaSTI) for various assumptions about the\ninitial helium content. Differences in observable quantities that can be\nattributed to variations in He content are generally detectable between stars\nof the Primordial (P, first-generation) and Extreme (E, second-generation)\npopulations, but not between the Primordial and Intermediate ones (I). The only\nexception (differences are significant also between P and I populations) is\nNGC2808, where three populations are clearly separated also on the Main\nSequence and the Horizontal Branch. The average enhancement in the He mass\nfraction Y between P and E stars is about 0.05-0.11, depending on the\nassumptions. The differences in Y, for NGC2808 alone, are about 0.11-0.14\nbetween P and I stars, and about 0.15-0.19 between P and E stars, again\ndepending on the assumptions. The RGB bump luminosity of first and\nsecond-generation stars has different levels; the implied Y difference is more\ndifficult to quantify, but is in agreement with the other determinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2010 09:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We introduce a framework, called the scaled\nunscented transform Gaussian sum filter (SUT-GSF), which combines two ideas:\nthe scaled unscented Kalman filter (SUKF) based on the concept of scaled\nunscented transform (SUT), and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The SUT is\nused to approximate the mean and covariance of a Gaussian random variable which\nis transformed by a nonlinear function, while the GMM is adopted to approximate\nthe probability density function (pdf) of a random variable through a set of\nGaussian distributions. With these two tools, a framework can be set up to\nassimilate nonlinear systems in a recursive way. Within this framework, one can\ntreat a nonlinear stochastic system as a mixture model of a set of sub-systems,\neach of which takes the form of a nonlinear system driven by a known Gaussian\nrandom process. Then, for each sub-system, one applies the SUKF to estimate the\nmean and covariance of the underlying Gaussian random variable transformed by\nthe nonlinear governing equations of the sub-system. Incorporating the\nestimations of the sub-systems into the GMM gives an explicit (approximate)\nform of the pdf, which can be regarded as a \"complete\" solution to the state\nestimation problem, as all of the statistical information of interest can be\nobtained from the explicit form of the pdf ...\n  This work is on the construction of the Gaussian sum filter based on the\nscaled unscented transform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2010 10:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A significant region of the parameter space with large to moderate\nnegative values of $A_0$ consistent with the stability of the scalar potential\nand relic density production via neutralino annihilation and/or neutralino -\nstau coannihilation yields observable signal via the jets + missing transverse\nenergy channel. The one lepton + jets + missing energy signal is also viable\nover a smaller but non-trivial parameter space. The ratio of the size of the\ntwo signals - free from theoretical uncertainties - may distinguish between\ndifferent relic density generating mechanisms. With efficient $\\tau$-tagging\nfacilities at 7 $TeV$ the discriminating power may increase significantly. We\nalso comment on other dark matter relic density allowed mSUGRA scenarios and\nvariants there of in the context of LHC-7 $TeV$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2010 12:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 04:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2010 15:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

A new feature of our procedure is that it enables us to extract from the\ndata simultaneously the QCD scale parameter $\\Lambda_{\\bar{\\rm MS}}$ and the\nboundary energy squared $s_{\\rm p}$.

The equilibrium density, at normal conditions, of DFT\nwater has been recently shown by Schmidt et al. [J. Phys. chem. B, 113, 11959\n(2009)] to be underestimated by different GGA functionals for exchange and\ncorrelation, and corrected by the addition of interatomic pair potentials to\ndescribe van derWaals (vdW) interactions. In this contribution we present a\nDFTAIMD study of liquid water using several GGA functionals as well as the van\nder Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,\n246401(2004)]. As expected, we find that the density of water is grossly\nunderestimated by GGA functionals. When a vdW-DF is used, the density improves\ndrastically and the experimental diffusivity is reproduced without the need of\nthermal corrections. We analyze the origin of the density differences between\nall the functionals. We show that the vdW-DF increases the population of\nnon-H-bonded interstitial sites, at distances between the first and second\ncoordination shells. However, it excessively weakens the H-bond network,\ncollapsing the second coordination shell. This structural problem is partially\nassociated to the choice of GGA exchange in the vdW-DF. We show that a\ndifferent choice for the exchange functional is enough to achieve an overall\nimprovement both in structure and diffusivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 May 2010 14:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2010 17:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
