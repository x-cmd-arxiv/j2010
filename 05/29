The build-up of magnetic helicity at small scales provides an\nimportant saturation mechanism. In order to understand the nature of the solar\ndynamo we need to understand the details of the saturation mechanism in\nspherical geometry. In particular, we want to understand the effects of\nmagnetic helicity fluxes from turbulence and meridional circulation. We\nconsider a model with just radial shear confined to a thin layer (tachocline)\nat the bottom of the convection zone. The kinetic alpha owing to helical\nturbulence is assumed to be localized in a region above the convection zone.\nThe dynamical quenching formalism is used to describe the build-up of mean\nmagnetic helicity in the model, which results in a magnetic alpha effect that\nfeeds back on the kinetic alpha effect. In some cases we compare with results\nobtained using a simple algebraic alpha quenching formula. In agreement with\nearlier findings, the magnetic alpha effect in the dynamical alpha quenching\nformalism has the opposite sign compared with the kinetic alpha effect and\nleads to a catastrophic decrease of the saturation field strength with\nincreasing magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, at high latitudes this quenching\neffect can lead to secondary dynamo waves that propagate poleward due to the\nopposite sign of alpha. Magnetic helicity fluxes both from turbulent mixing and\nfrom meridional circulation alleviate catastrophic quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 17:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

Our models adopt\ncosmologically-motivated conditions wherein dSphs are dark-matter dominated\nsystems that form hierarchically and orbit about a host galaxy. Our analytical\nestimates show that wide binaries are disrupted at a rate that is proportional\nto the local density of dark substructures averaged over the life-time of the\nbinary population. The fact that external tides can efficiently strip dark\nsubstructures from the outskirts of dSphs implies that the present number and\ndistribution of binaries is strongly coupled with the mass evolution of\nindividual galaxies.

However, there is\nstill disagreement about the contribution of individual solar features for\nchanges in the solar output, in particular over decadal time scales. Ionized Ca\nII K line spectroheliograms are one of the major resources for these long-term\ntrend studies, mainly because such measurements have been available now for\nmore than 100 years. In this paper we introduce a new Ca II K plage and active\nnetwork index time series derived from the digitization of almost 40,000\nphotographic solar images that were obtained at the 60-foot solar tower,\nbetween 1915 and 1985, as a part of the monitoring program of the Mount Wilson\nObservatory. We describe here the procedure we applied to calibrate the images\nand the properties of our new defined index, which is strongly correlated to\nthe average fractional area of the visible solar disk occupied by plages and\nactive network. We show that the long-term variation of this index is in an\nexcellent agreement with the 11-year solar cycle trend determined from the\nannual international sunspot numbers series. Our time series agrees also very\nwell with similar indicators derived from a different reduction of the same\ndata base and other \\caii K spectroheliograms long-term synoptic programs, such\nas those at Kodaikanal Observatory (India), and at the National Solar\nObservatory at Sacramento Peak (USA). Finally, we show that using appropriate\nproxies it is possible to extend this time series up to date, making this data\nset one of the longest Ca II K index series currently available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 21:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

The\nsource first transmits locally. The cooperating nodes that receive the source\nsignal retransmit a weighted version of it in an amplify-and-forward (AF)\nfashion. Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of the channel state\ninformation, beamforming weights are determined so that the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) at the destination is maximized subject to two different power\nconstraints, i.e., a total (source and relay) power constraint, and individual\nrelay power constraints.

For the latter constraint, the original problem is transformed into a\nhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem.

Despite of the great success of the P2P file sharing systems,\nthese systems support only \"simple\" queries. The focus in such systems is how\nto carry out an efficient query routing in order to find the nodes storing a\ndesired file. Recently, several research works have been made to extend P2P\nsystems to be able to share data having a fine granularity (i.e. atomic\nattribute) and to process queries written with a highly expressive language\n(i.e. SQL). These works have led to the emergence of P2P data sharing systems\nthat represent a new generation of P2P systems and, on the other hand, a next\nstage in a long period of the database research area. ? The characteristics of\nP2P systems (e.g. large-scale, node autonomy and instability) make impractical\nto have a global catalog that represents often an essential component in\ntraditional database systems. Usually, such a catalog stores information about\ndata, schemas and data sources. Query routing and processing are two problems\naffected by the absence of a global catalog. Locating relevant data sources and\ngenerating a close to optimal execution plan become more difficult. In this\npaper, we concentrate our study on proposed solutions for the both problems.\nFurthermore, selected case studies of main P2P data sharing systems are\nanalyzed and compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2010 08:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

Demaine and Hajiaghayi extended the theory to obtain PTASs for\nbidimensional problems, and subsequently improved these results to EPTASs.\nFomin et. al related the theory to the existence of linear kernels for\nparameterized problems. In this paper we revisit bidimensionality theory from\nthe perspective of approximation algorithms and redesign the framework for\nobtaining EPTASs to be more powerful, easier to apply and easier to understand.\n  Two of the most widely used approaches to obtain PTASs on planar graphs are\nthe Lipton-Tarjan separator based approach, and Baker's approach. Demaine and\nHajiaghayi strengthened both approaches using bidimensionality and obtained\nEPTASs for a multitude of problems. We unify the two strenghtened approaches to\ncombine the best of both worlds.

Here, OPT is the objective function value of the problem in question\nand f is a function depending only on e.

The phonon calculations demonstrate\na rather strong dependence of partial iron phonon densities of states on the\nactual position of Fe monolayer in the multilayer structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2010 13:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

We have selected\nfrom the literature a sample of 27 dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies.\nMOND is successful in explaining the general shape of the observed rotation\ncurves for roughly three quarters of the galaxies in the sample presented here.\nHowever, for the remaining quarter, MOND does not adequately explain the\nobserved rotation curves. Considering the uncertainties in distances and\ninclinations for the galaxies in our sample, a small fraction of poor MOND\npredictions is expected and is not necessarily a problem for MOND. We have also\nmade fits taking the MOND acceleration constant, a_0, as a free parameter in\norder to identify any systematic trends. We find that there appears to be a\ncorrelation between central surface brightness and the best-fit value of a_0,\nin the sense that lower surface brightness galaxies tend to have lower a_0.\nHowever, this correlation depends strongly on a small number of galaxies whose\nrotation curves might be uncertain due to either bars or warps. Without these\ngalaxies, there is less evidence of a trend, but the average value we find for\na_0 ~ 0.7*10^-8 cm s^-2 is somewhat lower than derived from previous studies.\nSuch lower fitted values of a_0 could occur if external gravitational fields\nare important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2010 14:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
