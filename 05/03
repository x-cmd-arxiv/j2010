The associated rate function can be computed as the action\nfunctional of a Lagrangian that is the Legendre transform of a certain\nnon-linear generator, playing a role analogous to the moment-generating\nfunction in the Gartner-Ellis theorem of large deviation theory when this is\napplied to finite-dimensional Markov processes. This rate function is used to\ndefine the notion of \"bad empirical measures\", which are the discontinuity\npoints of the optimal trajectories (i.e., the trajectories minimizing the rate\nfunction) given the empirical measure at the end of the trajectory. The\ndynamical Gibbs-non-Gibbs transitions are linked to the occurrence of bad\nempirical measures: for short times no bad empirical measures occur, while for\nintermediate and large times bad empirical mea- sures are possible. A future\nresearch program is proposed to classify the various possible scenarios behind\nthis crossover, which we refer to as a \"nature-versus-nurture\" transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2010 16:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We build up to results obtained by applying this generalised\ncollectively compact operator theory to the set of limit operators of an\noperator $A$. In the second half of this text we study bounded linear operators\non the generalised sequence space $\\ell^p(\\Z^N,U)$, where $p\\in [1,\\infty]$ and\n$U$ is some complex Banach space. We make what seems to be a more complete\nstudy than hitherto of the connections between Fredholmness, invertibility,\ninvertibility at infinity, and invertibility or injectivity of the set of limit\noperators, with some emphasis on the case when the operator $A$ is a locally\ncompact perturbation of the identity. Especially, we obtain stronger results\nthan previously known for the subtle limiting cases of $p=1$ and $\\infty$.

This has motivated the derivation of learning methods for\ndesigning a dictionary which leads to the sparsest representation for a given\nset of signals. In some applications, the signals of interest can have further\nstructure, so that they can be well approximated by a union of a small number\nof subspaces (e.g., face recognition and motion segmentation). This implies the\nexistence of a dictionary which enables block-sparse representations of the\ninput signals once its atoms are properly sorted into blocks. In this paper, we\npropose an algorithm for learning a block-sparsifying dictionary of a given set\nof signals. We do not require prior knowledge on the association of signals\ninto groups (subspaces). Instead, we develop a method that automatically\ndetects the underlying block structure. This is achieved by iteratively\nalternating between updating the block structure of the dictionary and updating\nthe dictionary atoms to better fit the data. Our experiments show that for\nblock-sparse data the proposed algorithm significantly improves the dictionary\nrecovery ability and lowers the representation error compared to dictionary\nlearning methods that do not employ block structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 06:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-04"}

The free energy is\nthe effective potential associated to a so-called reaction coordinate (RC).\nComputing free energy differences remains an important challenge in molecular\ndynamics due to the presence of meta-stable regions in the potential energy\nsurface. The ABF method uses an on-the-fly estimate of the free energy to bias\ndynamics and overcome metastability. Using entropy arguments and logarithmic\nSobolev inequalities, previous results have shown that the rate of convergence\nof the ABF method is limited by the metastable features of the canonical\nmeasures conditioned to being at fixed values of the RC.

It is based upon the works of\nthis author but particularly on his \"Manuel du sp\\'eculateur \\`a la Bourse\"\n(Stock Market Speculator Manual) edited in 1857 in Paris. Compared to the\nmarkets of today, however, the stock market described by Proudhon appears\nembryonic. Nevertheless it represents the location for transactions in\nfinancial assets, commodities, precious metals and even some transactions\ninvolving options. This contribution is organised in the following manner - the\nfirst section is devoted to the development of Proudhon's thought in relation\nto speculation. It is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon's definitions of stock market speculation or gambling\nwith shares that for him served no purpose either from a human or economic\nperspective and was therefore condemnable and to be contrasted with\nentrepreneurial speculation that, even though it is a highly-risky activity,\ninvolves the spirit of enterprise and provides the lifeblood of economic\ngrowth. The second part allows us to present Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's\npropositions in relation to restricting the speculation that he considers\nobnoxious. The second section has two objectives: one part places in\nperspective the views of Proudhon and the characteristics of stock market\nactivity under the Second Empire whilst the other part examines current-day\naspects of the characteristics evoked by Proudhon. We are interested especially\nin the question of the regulation and that of the relevance today of certain\naccounting practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 07:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-20"}

In the social\ninteractions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory\nactivity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of\napproaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming\nbehavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5\nmg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in\nthe elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the\npartition test.

This paper is focused on the study of the main sources of\nuncertainty which affect the \\Delta Y/\\Delta Z derived from the analysis of the\nlow-main sequence (MS) stars in the solar neighborhood. The possibility to\ninfer the value of \\Delta Y/\\Delta Z from the study of low-MS stars relies on\nthe dependence of the stellar luminosity and effective temperature on the\ninitial Y and Z. The \\Delta Y/\\Delta Z ratio is obtained by comparing the\nmagnitude difference between the observed stars and a reference theoretical\nzero age main sequence (ZAMS) with the related theoretical magnitude\ndifferences computed from a new set of stellar models with up-to-date input\nphysics and a fine grid of chemical compositions. A Monte Carlo approach has\nbeen used to evaluate the impact on the result of different sources of\nuncertainty, i.e. observational errors, evolutionary effects, systematic\nuncertainties of the models. As a check of the procedure, the method has been\napplied to a different data set, namely the low-MS of the Hyades.

Many of these sources are variable. Taking into account that nearly\nhalf of INTEGRAL/ISGRI sources are new and many of them are still unidentified,\nthe variability properties of the sources can serve as additional parameters\nthat may help to classify and identify the unknown sources. Aims: In order to\nstudy the variability properties of the sources detected by INTEGRAL/ISGRI we\ndevelop a method to quantify the variability of a source. We describe here our\ntechniques and compile a catalog of the sources that fit our criteria of\nvariability. Methods: We use the natural time binning of INTEGRAL observations\ncalled Science Window ($\\approx 2000$ seconds) and test the hypothesis that the\ndetected sources are constant using a $\\chi^2$ all-sky map in three energy\nbands (20-40, 40-100, 100-200 keV). We calculate an intrinsic variance of the\nflux in individual pixels and use it to define the fractional variability of a\nsource. The method is sensitive to the source variability on time scales of one\nScience Window and higher. We concentrate only on the sources which were\nalready reported to be detected by INTEGRAL. Results: We present a catalog of\n202 sources which are found to be significantly variable. For the catalog\nsources we give the measure of variability and fluxes with corresponding errors\nin 20-40, 40-100, 100-200 keV energy bands, and we present some statistics\nabout the population of variable sources. The description of the physical\nproperties of the variable sources will be given in a forthcoming paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 10:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 14:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A\nmodified version, having a parabolic current density profile, is employed here.\nWe find that the equilibrium is reconstructed with very high accuracy in a\nrepresentative range of parameter space, using only the vector field in the\nbottom boundary as input.

Among intermediate-mass and massive stars, fast\nrotators are common objects. Taking the rotation effects into account is needed\nto correctly understand, identify, and interpret the observed oscillation\nfrequencies of these stars. A classical approach is to consider the rotation as\na perturbation. In this paper, we focus on gravity modes, such as those\noccurring in gamma Doradus, slowly pulsating B (SPB), or Be stars. We aim to\ndefine the suitability of perturbative methods. With the two-dimensional\noscillation program (TOP), we performed complete computations of gravity modes\n-including the Coriolis force, the centrifugal distortion, and compressible\neffects- in 2-D distorted polytropic models of stars. We started with the modes\nl=1, n=1-14, and l=2-3, n=1-5,16-20 of a nonrotating star, and followed these\nmodes by increasing the rotation rate up to 70% of the break-up rotation rate.\nWe then derived perturbative coefficients and determined the domains of\nvalidity of the perturbative methods. Second-order perturbative methods are\nsuited to computing low-order, low-degree mode frequencies up to rotation\nspeeds ~100 km/s for typical gamma Dor stars or ~150 km/s for B stars. The\ndomains of validity can be extended by a few tens of km/s thanks to the\nthird-order terms. For higher order modes, the domains of validity are\nnoticeably reduced. Moreover, perturbative methods are inefficient for modes\nwith frequencies lower than the Coriolis frequency 2Omega. We interpret this\nfailure as a consequence of a modification in the shape of the resonant cavity\nthat is not taken into account in the perturbative approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 12:40:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 12:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}

We found that in general, the GGA\nresults are closer to the experimental values than those of the local spin\ndensity approximation. The calculated formation enthalpy data indicate the\nimportance of a systematic study on the ternary Fe-C-$X$ systems rather than\nthe binary Fe-$X$ systems, in steel design. The lattice parameters are\noptimized and the conditions for spin polarization at the impurity sites are\ndiscussed in terms of the local Stoner model. Our calculations, which are\nconsistent with previous work, imply that the local spin-polarizations at Sc,\nTi, V, Cu, and Zn are induced by the host Fe atoms. The early transition-metal\natoms couple antiferromagnetically, while the late transition-metal atoms\ncouple ferromagnetically, to the host Fe atoms. The calculated total\nmagnetization ($M$) of bcc Fe is reduced by impurity elements from Sc to Cr as\na result of the antiferromagnetic interaction, with the opposite effect for\nsolutes which couple ferromagnetically. The changes in $M$ are attributed to\nnearest neighbor interactions, mostly between the impurity and host atoms.

In this work, the connection between global and local\nsupersymmetry is explicitly constructed, providing a non-trivial gravity\ndecoupled limit of type II strings already in perturbation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 15:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A key ingredient of their proof was a recurrence\nequation for the connected graphs count due to Wright. No analogue of Wright's\nrecurrence seems to exist for digraphs. In a previous paper with Nick Wormald\nwe rederived the BCM formula via counting two-connected graphs among the graphs\nof minimum degree $2$, at least.

The latter shows step edges oriented parallel to the [110]\n(in-plane) crystallographic direction. Room temperature high resolution\nvectorial Kerr magnetometry measurements have been performed at different\napplied magnetic field directions in the whole angular range. In general, the\nmagnetic properties of the LSMO films can be interpreted with just the uniaxial\nterm with the anisotropy axis given by the film morphology, whereas the\nstrength of this anisotropy depends on both structure and film thickness. In\nparticular, LSMO films grown on nominally flat (110)-oriented STO substrates\npresents a well defined uniaxial anisotropy originated from the existence of\nelongated in-plane [001]-oriented structures, whereas LSMO films grown on\nnominally flat (001)-oriented STO substrates show a weak uniaxial magnetic\nanisotropy with the easy axis direction aligned parallel to residual substrate\nstep edges. Elongated structures are also found for LSMO films grown on vicinal\nSTO(001) substrates. These films present a well-defined uniaxial magnetic\nanisotropy with the easy axis lying along the step edges and its strength\nincreases with the LSMO thickness. It is remarkable that this step-induced\nuniaxial anisotropy has been found for LSMO films up to 120 nm thickness. Our\nresults are promising for engineering novel half-metallic magnetic devices that\nexploit tailored magnetic anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 09:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 19:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 19:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-21"}
