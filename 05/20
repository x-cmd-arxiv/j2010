We start off by building up\nMaxwell electrodynamics in (3+1)D from the assumption that the associated\nLagrangian is a gauge-invariant functional that depends on the electron and\nphoton fields and their first derivatives only. In this scenario, as\nwell-known, it is not possible to set up a Lorentz invariant gauge theory\ncontaining a massive photon. We show nevertheless that there exist two\nradically different electrodynamics, namely, the Chern-Simons and the Podolsky\nformulations, in which this problem can be overcome. The former is only valid\nin odd space-time dimensions, while the latter requires the presence of\nhigher-order derivatives of the gauge field in the Lagrangian. This theory,\nusually known as Podolsky electrodynamics, is simultaneously gauge and Lorentz\ninvariant; in addition, it contains a massive photon. Therefore, a massive\nphoton, unlike the popular belief, can be adequately accommodated within the\ncontext of a gauge-invariant electrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 16:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

At zero\ntemperature this double-well structure is suppressed, but an anomalous energy\ndependence of the self-energy remains. For the frustrated Hubbard model on the\nsquare lattice with next-nearest neighbor hopping, the presence of the van Hove\nsingularity changes the asymptotic low temperature behavior of the resistivity\nfrom a Fermi liquid to non-Fermi liquid dependency as function of doping.

But until now no mechanism proposed has\nsatisfactorily explained this phenomenon. Objective: The aim of this research\nis to propose a mechanism, until now never considered, which could drive the\natmosphere of Venus in its superrotation. This mechanism involves the transfer\nof the transterminator ionospheric flow momentum to the lower atmosphere via\npressure waves generated in the cryosphere of Venus. The mechanism proposed\npresents a source of energy sufficiently strong to allow the transfer of energy\ndespite dissipation. Method: The energy flow which transports the\ntransterminator flow and the energy lost by the viscosity in the superrotating\natmosphere were calculated. Both results were compared to establish if there is\nsufficient energy in the transterminator flow to drive the superrotation.\nFinally, the amplitude that the waves should have to be able to obtain the\nmomentum necessary to induce superrotation was calculated. Also an experimental\nmodel was made presenting some similarities with the process described.\nResults: The calculated power for the transterminator flow is 8.48x10e10 W. The\ncalculated viscous dissipation of the superrotating flow is 1.4x10e9 W.\nTherefore, there is sufficient energy in the transterminator flow to maintain\nsuperrotation. The amplitude of the waves generated in the cryosphere,\nnecessary to deposit the power dissipated by the viscous forces, is 10e-4 m for\nwaves of 1 Hz and 10e-8 m for waves of 10e4 Hz. These amplitudes imply that at\nthe altitude of the clouds on the night side there must be a constant sound of\n83 dB. If the superrotation of Venus were to stop, with the continuous\ninjection of 1.4x10e9 W, the actual superrotation would appear again in\n1.4x10e6 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 16:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 18:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 16:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02"}

FRS method helps to\nprobe the inner zones of an accretion disk. We find that the FRS is well\ndescribed by a single blackbody component with kT in a range 1.0-1.4 keV\nresponsible for the source variability in the frequency ranges 0.002-0.04 Hz,\nand 0.07-0.3 Hz. We attribute this component to the accretion disk and possibly\nemission from an existing boundary layer supported by radiation pressure. The\nappearance of the blackbody component in the lower frequency ranges and\ndisappearance towards the higher frequencies suggests that it may also be a\ndisk-blackbody emission. We detect a different form of FRS for the higher\nfrequency ranges 0.9-6 Hz and 8-30 Hz which is modeled best with a power-law\nand a Gaussian emission line at 6.4$^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ keV with an equivalent\nwidth of 1.6$^{+0.4}_{-1.2}$ keV and 1.3$^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ keV for the two\nfrequency ranges, respectively. This iron fluorescence line detected in the\nhigher frequency ranges of spectra shows the existence of reflection in this\nsystem within the inner disk regions.

Using the\njunction condition formalism, we study the conditions for energy conservation\nin detail, and solve explicitly for the types of allowed classical transition\ngeometries. We show that the repulsive nature of domain walls, and the de\nSitter expansion associated with a positive energy minimum, can allow for\nclassical transitions to vacua of higher energy than that of the colliding\nbubbles. Transitions can be made out of negative or zero energy (terminal)\nvacua to a de Sitter phase, re-starting eternal inflation, and populating new\nvacua. However, the classical transition cannot produce vacua with energy\nhigher than the original parent vacuum, which agrees with previous results on\nthe construction of pockets of false vacuum.

Using the method, the probabilities for\ndifferent diffusion lengths are calculated and their dependence on system size\nand the number of deposited layers is studied. Numerical simulation of surface\ndiffusion in random deposition model with varying extents of diffusion are\nperformed and their results are interpreted in the light of the analytical\ncalculations. Thus, a clearer understanding of the diffusion process and the\neffect of diffusion length on surface roughness is obtained. Systems with\nsurface diffusion show nearly random deposition-like behaviour upto monolayer\ndeposition. Their interface widths, in a logarithmic plot, are initially\nlinear, as in random deposition. With increase in the number of layers,\ncorrelation effects between neighbouring columns become dominant. The interface\ndeviates from its initial linear growth and eventually becomes saturated.

Our model reproduces the\nestablished properties of Earth's interior and magnetic field at the present\ntime. When applied to Venus, assuming that planet lacks plate tectonics and has\na dehydrated mantle with an elevated viscosity, the model shows that the dynamo\nshuts down or never operated. Our model predicts that at a fixed planet mass,\ndynamo history is sensitive to core size, but not to the initial inventory of\nlong-lived, heat-producing radionuclides. It predicts that rocky planets larger\nthan 2.5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the\ntemperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the\ncore adiabat. Instead, iron \"snow\" will condense near or at the top of these\ncores, and the net transfer of latent heat upwards will suppress convection and\na dynamo. More massive planets can have anemic dynamos due to core cooling, but\nonly if they have mobile lids (plate tectonics). The lifetime of these dynamos\nis shorter with increasing planet mass but longer with higher surface\ntemperature. Massive Venus-like planets with stagnant lids and more viscous\nmantles will lack dynamos altogether.

This explains why\nspectra of the main belt asteroids, exposed to these `space weathering'\nprocesses over eons, do not match the laboratory spectra of ordinary chondrite\n(OC) meteorites. In contrast, an important fraction of Near Earth Asteroids\n(NEAs), defined as Q-types in the asteroid taxonomy, display spectral\nattributes that are a good match to OCs. Here we study the possibility that the\nQ-type NEAs underwent recent encounters with the terrestrial planets and that\nthe tidal gravity (or other effects) during these encounters exposed fresh OC\nmaterial on the surface (thus giving it the Q-type spectral properties). We\nused numerical integrations to determine the statistics of encounters of NEAs\nto planets. The results were used to calculate the fraction and orbital\ndistribution of Q-type asteroids expected in the model as a function of the\nspace weathering timescale, t_sw (see main text for definition), and maximum\ndistance, r*, at which planetary encounters can reset the surface. We found\nthat t_sw ~ 1e6 yr (at 1 AU) and r* ~ 5 R_pl, where R_pl is the planetary\nradius, best fit the data. Values t_sw < 1e5 yr would require that r* > 20\nR_pl, which is probably implausible because these very distant encounters\nshould be irrelevant. Also, the fraction of Q-type NEAs would be probably much\nlarger than the one observed if t_sw > 1e7 yr. We found that t_sw ~ q^2, where\nq is the perihelion distance, expected if the solar wind sputtering controls\nt_sw, provides a better match to the orbital distribution of Q-type NEAs than\nmodels with fixed t_sw.

Here we present multi-wavelength\nobservations of the nearby poor X-ray cluster MZ 10451, in which both processes\ncan be studied in unprecedented detail. Chandra observations of the\nintracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core, which harbors two optically\nbright early-type galaxies in the process of merging, show that the system has\nretained a cool core and a central metal excess. This suggests that any\nmerger-induced ICM heating and mixing remain modest at this stage. Tidally\nstripped stars seen around either galaxy likely represent an emerging\nintracluster light component, and the central ICM abundance enhancement may\nhave a prominent contribution from in situ enrichment provided by these stars.\nThe smaller of the merging galaxies shows evidence for having retained a hot\ngas halo, along with tentative evidence for some obscured star formation,\nsuggesting that not all BCG major mergers at low redshift are completely\ndissipationless. Both galaxies are slightly offset from the peak of the ICM\nemission, with all three lying on an axis that roughly coincides with the\nlarge-scale elongation of the ICM. Our data are consistent with a picture in\nwhich central BCGs are built up by mergers close to the cluster core, by\ngalaxies infalling on radial orbits aligned with the cosmological filaments\nfeeding the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The same is true\nfor the measurements of these isotopes and of the $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratio in\npresolar grains of circumstellar origin. Non-convective mixing, occurring\nduring both Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stages is\nthe explanation commonly invoked to account for the above evidence. Recently,\nthe need for such mixing phenomena on the AGB was questioned, and chemical\nanomalies usually attributed to them were suggested to be formed in earlier\nphases. We have therefore re-calculated extra-mixing effects in low mass stars\nfor both the RGB and AGB stages, in order to verify the above claims. Our\nresults contradict them; we actually confirm that slow transport below the\nconvective envelope occurs also on the AGB. This is required primarily by the\noxygen isotopic mix and the $^{26}$Al content of presolar oxide grains. Other\npieces of evidence exist, in particular from the isotopic ratios of carbon\nstars of type N, or C(N), in the Galaxy and in the LMC, as well as of SiC\ngrains of AGB origin. We further show that, when extra-mixing occurs in the RGB\nphases of population I stars above about 1.2 $M_{\\odot}$, this consumes $^3$He\nin the envelope, probably preventing the occurrence of thermohaline diffusion\non the AGB. Therefore, we argue that other extra-mixing mechanisms should be\nactive in those final evolutionary phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 20:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We define an algorithm to be\nresistant to drift if, for some inverse polynomial drift rate in the target\nfunction, it converges to accuracy 1 -- \\epsilon , with polynomial resources,\nand then stays within that accuracy indefinitely, except with probability\n\\epsilon , at any one time. We show that every evolution algorithm, in the\nsense of Valiant (2007; 2009), can be converted using the Correlational Query\ntechnique of Feldman (2008), into such a drift resistant algorithm. For certain\nevolutionary algorithms, such as for Boolean conjunctions, we give bounds on\nthe rates of drift that they can resist. We develop some new evolution\nalgorithms that are resistant to significant drift. In particular, we give an\nalgorithm for evolving linear separators over the spherically symmetric\ndistribution that is resistant to a drift rate of O(\\epsilon /n), and another\nalgorithm over the more general product normal distributions that resists a\nsmaller drift rate.\n  The above translation result can be also interpreted as one on the robustness\nof the notion of evolvability itself under changes of definition. As a second\nresult in that direction we show that every evolution algorithm can be\nconverted to a quasi-monotonic one that can evolve from any starting point\nwithout the performance ever dipping significantly below that of the starting\npoint.

In\ncontrast, maximum likelihood asymptotic (mla) intervals are commonly used\nwithout respect to sample size. It is shown here that profile likelihood\nintervals actually are a good alternative for the estimation of quantiles for\nsample sizes $25 \\leq n\\leq 100$ of block maxima, since they presented adequate\ncoverage frequencies in contrast to the poor coverage frequencies of mla\nintervals for these sample sizes, which also tended to underestimate the\nquantile and therefore might be a dangerous statistical practice.\n  In addition, maximum likelihood estimation can present problems when Weibull\nmodels are considered for moderate or small sample sizes due to singularities\nof the corresponding density function when the shape parameter is smaller than\none. These estimation problems can be traced to the commonly used continuous\napproximation to the likelihood function and could be avoided by using the\nexact or correct likelihood function, at least for the settings considered\nhere.

Previous methods such as l1/l2-regularized multi-task\nregression assume that all of the output variables are equally related to the\ninputs, although in many real-world problems, outputs are related in a complex\nmanner. In this paper, we propose graph-guided fused lasso (GFlasso) for\nstructured multi-task regression that exploits the graph structure over the\noutput variables.

A global\noptimization procedure yields network topologies in which this balance is\noptimized. These are compared with network topologies generated by a\ncompetitive process in which each node strives to optimize its own\ncost-communication balance. Three phases are observed in globally optimal\nconfigurations for different cost-communication trade-offs: (i) regular small\nworlds, (ii) star-like networks and (iii) trees with a centre of interconnected\nhubs. In the latter regime, i.e. for very expensive wire, power laws in the\nlink length distributions $P(w)\\propto w^{-\\alpha}$ are found, which can be\nexplained by a hierarchical organization of the networks.

However, it is still an open problem how to\nidentify the intrinsic multiple scales of networks. In this article, we\nconsider detecting the multi-scale community structure of network from the\nperspective of dimension reduction. According to this perspective, a covariance\nmatrix of network is defined to uncover the multi-scale community structure\nthrough the translation and rotation transformations. It is proved that the\ncovariance matrix is the unbiased version of the well-known modularity matrix.\nWe then point out that the translation and rotation transformations fail to\ndeal with the heterogeneous network, which is very common in nature and\nsociety. To address this problem, a correlation matrix is proposed through\nintroducing the rescaling transformation into the covariance matrix. Extensive\ntests on real world and artificial networks demonstrate that the correlation\nmatrix significantly outperforms the covariance matrix, identically the\nmodularity matrix, as regards identifying the multi-scale community structure\nof network. This work provides a novel perspective to the identification of\ncommunity structure and thus various dimension reduction methods might be used\nfor the identification of community structure. Through introducing the\ncorrelation matrix, we further conclude that the rescaling transformation is\ncrucial to identify the multi-scale community structure of network, as well as\nthe translation and rotation transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 08:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 07:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

The shift can be related to the Lorentz angle which is\ntypically a few degrees for holes and a few tens of degrees for electrons in a\n4 T magnetic field. The Lorentz angle depends upon magnetic field, electric\nfield inside the sensor and temperature. In this study the sensitivity to\nradiation for fluences up to 10^16 n/cm^2 has been studied. The Lorentz shift\nhas been measured by inducing ionization with 670 nm red or 1070 nm infrared\nlaser beams injected into the back side of the irradiated silicon sensor\noperated in magnetic fields up to 8 T. For holes the shift as a function of\nradiation is increasing, while for electrons it is decreasing and even changes\nsign. The fact that for irradiated sensors the Lorentz shift for electrons is\nsmaller than for holes, in contrast to the observations in non-irradiated\nsensors, can be qualitatively explained by the structure of the electric field\nin irradiated sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 08:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

We carried\nout precise magnetic observations on both the North polar region and the quiet\nSun at the East limb with the Spectro-Polarimeter of the Solar Optical\nTelescope aboard Hinode to characterize the polar region with respect to the\nquiet Sun. The average area and the total magnetic flux of the kG magnetic\nconcentrations in the polar region appear to be larger than those of the quiet\nSun. The magnetic field vectors classified as vertical in the quiet Sun have\nsymmetric histograms around zero in the strengths, showing balanced positive\nand negative flux, while the histogram in the North polar region is clearly\nasymmetric, showing a predominance of the negative polarity. The total magnetic\nflux of the polar region is larger than that of the quiet Sun. In contrast, the\nhistogram of the horizontal magnetic fields is exactly the same between the\npolar region and the quiet Sun. This is consistent with the idea that a local\ndynamo process is responsible for the horizontal magnetic fields. A\nhigh-resolution potential field extrapolation shows that the majority of\nmagnetic field lines from the kG-patches in the polar region are open with a\nfanning-out structure very low in the atmosphere, while in the quiet Sun,\nalmost all the field lines are closed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 11:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

As the model example, the measurement of dichotomic observable A,\ndescribing the object S, is performed by the information system O during S,O\ninteraction. The measurement of two S ensembles is considered, first one is the\npure ensemble, in which S state is the superposition of A eigenstates |S1>,|S2>\nother one is their probabilistic mixture. It is shown that these information\nconstraints induced by Heisenberg commutation relations bloke the transfer of\ninformation about the purity of S state; for the studied ensembles it is\ndescribed by the expectation value of observable A', conjugated to A. Due to\nthese restrictions, O can't discriminate the pure and mixed S ensembles with\nthe same A expectation value.

Then using the log N-log P diagram for\nBATSE bursts, we determine the LF (with and without evolution with redshift)\nand the formation rate of LGRBs, obtaining constraints on the slope of the\npower-law. We check the resulting redshift distribution with SWIFT data updated\nto 2009 August, finding that models where LGRBs have as progenitors stars with\nZ<0.3Z_sun and without evolution of the LF are in agreement with the data.

Data collected from 2005 to 2007 are analyzed. Spectra are derived\non time scales ranging from 3 years to 4 minutes. Light curve variability is\nstudied through doubling timescales and structure functions, and is compared\nwith red noise process simulations. The source is found to be in a low state\nfrom 2005 to 2007, except for a set of exceptional flares which occurred in\nJuly 2006. The quiescent state of the source is characterized by an associated\nmean flux level of 4.32 +/-0.09 x 10^-11 cm^-2 s^-1 above 200 GeV, or\napproximately 15% of the Crab Nebula, and a power law photon index of 3.53\n+/-0.06. During the flares of July 2006, doubling timescales of ~2 min are\nfound. The spectral index variation is examined over two orders of magnitude in\nflux, yielding different behaviour at low and high fluxes,which is a new\nphenomenon in VHE gamma-ray emitting blazars. The variability amplitude\ncharacterized by the fractional r.m.s. is strongly energy-dependent and is\nproportional to E^(0.19 +/- 0.01). The light curve r.m.s. correlates with the\nflux. This is the signature of a multiplicative process which can be accounted\nfor as a red noise with a Fourier index of ~2. This unique data set shows\nevidence for a low level gamma-ray emission state from PKS 2155-304, which\npossibly has a different origin than the outbursts.

We call it a k-smooth function or a\nsmooth function if k can grow infinitively. Based on quantum physics, there is\nno such smooth surface in the real world on a very small scale. However, we do\nhave a concept of smooth surfaces in practice since we always compare whether\none surface is smoother than another one. This paper deals with the possible\ndefinitions of \"natural\" smoothness and their relationship to the original\nmathematical definition of smooth functions. The motivation of giving the\ndefinition of a smooth function is to study smooth extensions for practical\napplications.\n  We observe this problem from two directions: From discrete to continuous, we\nsuggest considering both micro smooth, the refinement of a smoothed function,\nand macro smooth, the best approximation using existing discrete space. (For\ntwo-dimensional or higher dimensional cases, we can use Hessian matrices.) From\ncontinuous to discrete, we suggest a new definition of natural smooth, it uses\na scan from down scaling to up scaling to obtain the a ratio for sign changes\nby ignoring zero to represent the smoothness. For differentiable functions,\nmathematical smoothness does not mean a \"good looking\" smooth for a sampled set\nin discrete space. Finally, we discuss the Lipschitz continuity for defining\nthe smoothness, which will be called discrete smoothness. This paper gives\nphilosophical consideration of smoothness for practical problems, rather than a\nmathematical deduction or reduction, even though our inferences are based on\nsolid mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 15:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-21"}
