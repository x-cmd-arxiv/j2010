In the\nnon-manifold case, Wright's method showed that when a one-ended, simply\nconnected, locally compact ANR X with pro-monomorphic fundamental group at\ninfinity admits an action of Z by covering transformations then the fundamental\ngroup at infinity of X is (up to pro-isomorphism) an inverse sequence of\nfinitely generated free groups.

Thus, all Carter diagrams containing long cycles can\nbe eliminated from the classification list. There exist diagrams determining\ntwo conjugacy classes in W.It is shown that any connected Carter diagram \\Gamma\ncontaining a 4-vertex pattern D_4 or D_4(a_1) determines a single conjugacy\nclass.

In the case of an\nautonomous system, the coupling function does not need to depend on all the\ninternal variables for achieving synchronization and its functional form is not\ncrucial for generalized synchronization. What becomes essential for reaching\nsynchronization in an extended system is the sharing of some minimal\ninformation by its elements, on the average, over long times, independently of\nthe nature (external or internal) of its source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 02:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We study the evolution of massive\nprotostars at such high rates by numerically solving the stellar structure\nequations. In this paper we examine the evolution via disk accretion. We\nconsider a limiting case of \"cold\" disk accretion, whereby most of the stellar\nphotosphere can radiate freely with negligible backwarming from the accretion\nflow, and the accreting material settles onto the star with the same specific\nentropy as the photosphere. We compare our results to the calculated evolution\nvia spherically symmetric accretion, the opposite limit, whereby the material\naccreting onto the star contains the entropy produced in the accretion shock\nfront. We examine how different accretion geometries affect the evolution of\nmassive protostars. For cold disk accretion at 10^-3 M_sun/yr the radius of a\nprotostar is initially small, about a few R_sun. After several solar masses\nhave accreted, the protostar begins to bloat up and for M \\simeq 10 M_sun the\nstellar radius attains its maximum of 30 - 400 R_sun. The large radius about\n100 R_sun is also a feature of spherically symmetric accretion at the same\naccreted mass and accretion rate. Hence, expansion to a large radius is a\nrobust feature of accreting massive protostars. At later times the protostar\neventually begins to contract and reaches the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) for\nM \\simeq 30 M_sun, independent of the accretion geometry. For accretion rates\nexceeding several 10^-3 M_sun/yr the protostar never contracts to the ZAMS. The\nvery large radius of several 100s R_sun results in a low effective temperature\nand low UV luminosity of the protostar. Such bloated protostars could well\nexplain the existence of bright high-mass protostellar objects, which lack\ndetectable HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 08:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We deduce\nthe k_T- and collinear factorizations for the DIS structure functions by\nconsecutive reductions of a more general theoretical construction. We begin by\nstudying the amplitude of the forward Compton scattering off a hadron target,\nrepresenting this amplitude as a set of convolutions of two blobs connected by\nthe simplest, two-parton intermediate states. Each blob in the convolutions can\ncontain both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. We formulate\nconditions for separating the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions\nand attributing them to the different blobs. After that the convolutions\ncorrespond to the QCD factorization. Then we reduce this totally unintegrated\n(basic) factorization first to the k_T- factorization and finally to the\ncollinear factorization. In order to yield a finite expression for the Compton\namplitude, the integration over the loop momentum in the basic factorization\nmust be free of both ultraviolet and infrared singularities. This obvious\nmathematical requirement leads to theoretical restrictions on the\nnon-perturbative contributions (parton distributions) to the Compton amplitude\nand the DIS structure functions related to the Compton amplitude through the\nOptical theorem. In particular, our analysis excludes the use of the singular\nfactors x^{-a} (with a > 0) in the fits for the quark and gluon distributions\nbecause such factors contradict to the integrability of the basic convolutions\nfor the Compton amplitude. This restriction is valid for all DIS structure\nfunctions in the framework of both the k_T- factorization and the collinear\nfactorization if we attribute the perturbative contributions only to the upper\nblob.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 08:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2011 17:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2011 09:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

The influence\nof the hole pattern on the magnetization is studied and compared by means of\nnumerical models and Hall probe mapping techniques. To this aim, we consider\ntwo bulk YBCO samples with a rectangular cross-section that are drilled each by\nsix holes arranged either on a rectangular lattice (sample I) or on a centered\nrectangular lattice (sample II). For the numerical analysis, three different\nmodels are considered for calculating the trapped flux: (i), a two-dimensional\n(2D) Bean model neglecting demagnetizing effects and flux creep, (ii), a 2D\nfinite-element model neglecting demagnetizing effects but incorporating\nmagnetic relaxation in the form of an E-J power law, and, (iii), a 3D finite\nelement analysis that takes into account both the finite height of the sample\nand flux creep effects. For the experimental analysis, the trapped magnetic\nflux density is measured above the sample surface by Hall probe mapping\nperformed before and after the drilling process. The maximum trapped flux\ndensity in the drilled samples is found to be smaller than that in the plain\nsamples. The smallest magnetization drop is found for sample II, with the\ncentered rectangular lattice. This result is confirmed by the numerical models.\nIn each sample, the relative drops that are calculated independently with the\nthree different models are in good agreement. As observed experimentally, the\nmagnetization drop calculated in the sample II is the smallest one and its\nrelative value is comparable to the measured one. By contrast, the measured\nmagnetization drop in sample (1) is much larger than that predicted by the\nsimulations, most likely because of a change of the microstructure during the\ndrilling process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 08:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Here we examine\nwhether the spectral energy distribution (SED) and dust temperature of galaxies\nhave strongly evolved since z~2.5. We use Herschel deep extragalactic surveys\nfrom 100 to 500um to compute total IR luminosities in galaxies down to the\nfaintest levels, using PACS and SPIRE in the GOODS-North field (PEP and HerMES\nkey programs). We show that measurements in the SPIRE bands can be used below\nthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution is\nused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by bright\nneighbors. Below z~1.5, mid-IR extrapolations are correct for star-forming\ngalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0\ngalaxies. This narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range of\nphysical processes that could have affected the SED of these galaxies.\nExtrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend to\noverestimate the total IR luminosity. This may be explained by the lack of\nfar-IR constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. We\nalso note that the dust temperature of luminous IR galaxies around z~1 is\nmildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ULIRGs at\nz~1.6. Above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantially\nlarger mid- over far-IR ratio, which could either result from stronger broad\nemission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden AGN. Two thirds of the\nAGNs identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavior\nas purely star-forming galaxies. Hence a large fraction of AGNs harbor star\nformation at very high SFR and in conditions similar to purely star-forming\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 09:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The sources are selected from the Spitzer \"Cores to\nDisks\" (c2d) legacy program. The environment of embedded protostars is complex\nboth in its physical structure (envelopes, outflows, jets, protostellar disks)\nand the physical processes (accretion, irradiation by UV and/or X-rays,\nexcitation through slow and fast shocks) which take place. A key point is to\nspatially resolve the emission in the Spitzer-IRS spectra. An optimal\nextraction method is used to separate both spatially unresolved (compact, up to\na few 100 AU) and spatially resolved (extended, 1000 AU or more) emission from\nthe IRS spectra. The results are compared with the c2d disk sample and\nliterature PDR and shock models to address the physical nature of the sources.\nBoth compact and extended emission features are observed. Warm (Tex few 100 K)\nH2, observed through the pure rotational H2 S(0), S(1) and S(2) lines, and [S\nI] 25 mu emission is observed primarily in the extended component. [S I] is\nobserved uniquely toward truly embedded sources and not toward disks. On the\nother hand hot (Tex>700 K) H2, observed primarily through the S(4) line, and\n[Ne II] emission is seen mostly in the compact component. [Fe II] and [Si II]\nlines are observed in both spatial components. Hot H2O emission is found in the\ncompact component of some sources. The observed emission on >=1000 AU scales is\ncharacteristic of PDR emission and likely originates in the outflow cavities in\nthe remnant envelope created by the stellar wind and jets from the embedded\nyoung stars. Weak shocks along the outflow wall can also contribute. The\ncompact emission is likely of mixed origin, comprised of optically thick\ncircumstellar disk and/or jet/outflow emission from the protostellar object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 10:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We find that the excitation of the CO rotational levels\nup to J=8 can be accounted for by UV radiation from star formation. However,\nthe approximately flat luminosity distribution of the CO lines over the\nrotational ladder above J=8 requires the presence of a separate source of\nexcitation for the highest CO lines. We explore X-ray heating by the accreting\nsupermassive black hole in Mrk231 as a source of excitation for these lines,\nand find that it can reproduce the observed luminosities. We also consider a\nmodel with dense gas in a strong UV radiation field to produce the highest CO\nlines, but find that this model strongly overpredicts the hot dust mass in\nMrk231. Our favoured model consists of a star forming disk of radius 560 pc,\ncontaining clumps of dense gas exposed to strong UV radiation, dominating the\nemission of CO lines up to J=8. X-rays from the accreting supermassive black\nhole in Mrk231 dominate the excitation and chemistry of the inner disk out to a\nradius of 160 pc, consistent with the X-ray power of the AGN in Mrk231.

The nodes in the\nnetwork are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks\ncan vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can\nobtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our\ngoal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node such that the\nlogical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain\nclose to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than\ndistant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.\n  Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting,\nwhere the network topology does not change. We show that the asymptotically\noptimal bounds obtained for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic\nsetting: if two nodes remain at distance $d$ from each other for sufficiently\nlong, it is possible to upper bound the difference between their clock values\nby $O(d \\log (D / d))$, where $D$ is the diameter of the network. This is known\nto be optimal even for static networks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm\nhas optimal stabilization time: when a path of length $d$ appears between two\nnodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced\nto $O(d \\log (D / d))$ is $O(D)$, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, the\ntechniques employed for the more intricate analysis of the algorithm for\ndynamic graphs provide additional insights that are also of interest for the\nstatic setting.

The cumulative quantum back-reactions of very\nsmall scales tachyonic modes terminate inflation very efficiently and shut off\nthe curvature perturbations evolution during the waterfall phase transition.\nThis indicates that the standard hybrid inflation model is safe under large\nscale curvature perturbations during the waterfall phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 14:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2010 18:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 10:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

This requires\nthe gas to avoid cooling and to remain at temperatures near T=10^4 K. We show\nthat this condition can be satisfied in the presence of a sufficiently strong\nprimordial magnetic field, which heats the collapsing gas via ambipolar\ndiffusion. If the field has a strength above B = 3.6 (comoving) nG, the\ncollapsing gas is kept warm (T=10^4K) until it reaches the critical density\nn_crit=10^3 cm^{-3} at which the roto-vibrational states of H_2 approach local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. H_2-cooling then remains inefficient, and the gas\ntemperature stays near 10^4K, even as it continues to collapse to higher\ndensities. The critical magnetic field strength required to permanently\nsuppress H_2-cooling is somewhat higher than upper limit of approx. 2 nG from\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Such chaos can be termed `confined chaos' and can play a very\nimportant role in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy\nstructures and in galactic dynamics in general.

On the other hand, fundamentally\nnonlocal models are fraught with complications, including instabilities and\ncomplications in setting up the initial value problem. We study the structure\nof the initial value problem in an interesting class of nonlocal models.

This component is located ~325 pc from the core, which is\nvariable and has a peaked radio spectrum. In the case of 3C318, a rest-frame RM\nof ~3030 rad/m**2 has been estimated for the brightest component which\ncontributes almost all of the polarised emission. Further, two more extended\ncomponents have been detected, clearly showing \"wiggles\" in the jet towards the\nsouthern side of the source.

The\nsolution is obtained as the genus expansion of the generating power series. The\ninitial term of this expansion is the corresponding generating function for\ntrees. The consequence equations for this term turns to be equivalent to the\ninversion problem for the gradient mapping defined by the initial condition.\nThe equations for the higher terms of the genus expansion are linear.

I investigate an impinging wave as a possible origin of the velocity\npattern, and the changes of the wave after the passage through the magnetic\nfields of the sunspot. The wave pattern found consists of a wave with about 3\nMm apparent wavelength that propagates towards the sunspot. This wave seems to\ntrigger oscillations inside the sunspot's umbra, which originate from a\nlocation inside the penumbra on the side of the impinging wave. The wavelength\ndecreases and the velocity amplitude increases by an order of magnitude in the\nchromospheric layers inside the sunspot. On the side of the sunspot opposite to\nthe impinging plane wave, circular wave fronts centered on the umbra are seen\npropagating away from the sunspot outside its outer white-light boundary. They\nlead to a peculiar ring structure around the sunspot, which is visible in both\nvelocity and intensity maps.

They are similar to localized waveguide mode solutions of\nMaxwell's equations for metal cavities or defects of photonic crystals, but, in\ncontrast to the latter, their spectrum lies in the radiation continuum. The\nphenomenon is identical to the existence of bound sates in the radiation\ncontinuum in quantum mechanics, discovered by von Neumann and Wigner. In the\nformal scattering theory, these states appear as resonances with the vanishing\nwidth. For the system studied, the bound states are shown to exist at specific\ndistances between the arrays in the spectral region where one or two\ndiffraction channels are open. Analytic solutions are obtained for all bound\nstates (below the radiation continuum and in it) in the limit of thin cylinders\n(the cylinder radius is much smaller than the wavelength). The existence of\nbound states is also established in the spectral region where three and more\ndiffraction channels are open, provided the cylinders' dielectric constant and\nradius are fine-tuned. The near field and scattering resonances of the\nstructure are investigated when the distance between the arrays varies in the\nneighborhood of its critical values at which the bound states are formed. In\nparticular, it is shown that the near field in the scattering process becomes\nsignificantly amplified in specific regions of the array as the distance\napproaches its critical values. The effect may be used to control optical\nnon-linear effects by varying the distance between the arrays near its critical\nvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 15:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 04:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}
