A flat layer of a ferrofluid is cooled such that the liquid has a\nrelatively high viscosity. Consequently, the dynamics of the formation of the\nRosensweig pattern becomes very slow. By sudden switching of the magnetic\ninduction, the system is pushed to an arbitrary point in the phase space\nspanned by the pattern amplitude and the magnetic induction. Afterwards, it is\nallowed to relax to its equilibrium point. From the dynamics of this\nrelaxation, we reconstruct the underlying fully nonlinear equation of motion of\nthe pattern amplitude. The measured nonlinear dynamics serves to select the\nbest weakly nonlinear expansion which describes this hysteretic transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2010 16:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Because\nof the large sample of extrasolar planets needed to better understand planetary\nformation, evolution, and prevalence, this new technique represents a logical\nnext step in instrumentation for RV extrasolar planet searches, and has been\nproven with the single-object Exoplanet Tracker (ET) at Kitt Peak National\nObservatory, and the multi-object W. M. Keck/MARVELS Exoplanet Tracker at\nApache Point Observatory. The development of the ET instruments has\nnecessitated fleshing out a detailed understanding of the physical principles\nof the DFDI technique. Here we summarize the fundamental theoretical material\nneeded to understand the technique and provide an overview of the physics\nunderlying the instrument's working. We also derive some useful analytical\nformulae that can be used to estimate the level of various sources of error\ngeneric to the technique, such as photon shot noise when using a fiducial\nreference spectrum, contamination by secondary spectra (e.g., crowded sources,\nspectroscopic binaries, or moonlight contamination), residual interferometer\ncomb, and reference cross-talk error. Following this, we show that the use of a\ntraditional gas absorption fiducial reference with a DFDI can incur significant\nsystematic errors that must be taken into account at the precision levels\nrequired to detect extrasolar planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 2010 23:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 03:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02"}

The local skeleton is traced on the 2D\nsphere by cubic spline interpolation which leads to more accurate estimation of\nthe intersection positions between the skeleton and the secondary pixels than\nconventional linear interpolation. We demonstrate that the skeleton-based\nestimator of non-Gaussianity of the local type (f_NL) - the departure of the\nlength distribution from the corresponding Gaussian expectation - yields an\nunbiased and sufficiently converged f_NL-likelihood.\n  We analyse the skeleton statistics in the WMAP5 combined V- and W-band data\noutside the Galactic base-mask determined from the KQ75 sky-coverage. The\nresults are consistent with Gaussian simulations of the the best-fitting\ncosmological model, but deviate from the previous results determined using the\nWMAP1 data. We show that it is unlikely that the improved skeleton tracing\nmethod, the omission of Q-band data, the modification of the\nforeground-template fitting method or the absence of 6 extended regions in the\nnew mask contribute to such a deviation. However, the application of the Kp0\nbase-mask in data processing does improve the consistency with the WMAP1\nresults.\n  The f_NL-likelihoods of the data are estimated at 9 different smoothing\nlevels. It is unexpected that the best-fit values show positive correlation\nwith the smoothing scales. Further investigation argues against a point-source\nor goodness-of-fit explanation but finds that about 30% of either Gaussian or\nf_NL samples having better goodness-of-fit than the WMAP5 show a similar\ncorrelation.

It is the probability distribution over independent sets $I$ of a\ngraph weighted proportionally to $\\lambda^{|I|}$ with fugacity parameter\n$\\lambda$. We prove that at the uniqueness threshold of the hardcore model on\nthe $d$-regular tree, approximating the partition function becomes\ncomputationally hard on graphs of maximum degree $d$.\n  Specifically, we show that unless NP$=$RP there is no polynomial time\napproximation scheme for the partition function (the sum of such weighted\nindependent sets) on graphs of maximum degree $d$ for fugacity $\\lambda_c(d) <\n\\lambda < \\lambda_c(d) + \\epsilon(d)$ where $\\lambda_c =\n\\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{(d-2)^d}$ is the uniqueness threshold on the $d$-regular\ntree and $\\epsilon(d)>0$. Weitz produced an FPTAS for approximating the\npartition function when $0<\\lambda < \\lambda_c(d)$ so this result demonstrates\nthat the computational threshold exactly coincides with the statistical physics\nphase transition thus confirming the main conjecture of [28]. We further\nanalyze the special case of $\\lambda=1, d=6$ and show there is no polynomial\ntime algorithm for approximately counting independent sets on graphs of maximum\ndegree $d= 6$ which is optimal.\n  Our proof is based on specially constructed random bi-partite graphs which\nact as gadgets in a reduction to MAX-CUT. Building on the second moment method\nanalysis of [28] and combined with an analysis of the reconstruction problem on\nthe tree our proof establishes a strong version of 'replica' method heuristics\ndeveloped by theoretical physicists. The result establishes the first rigorous\ncorrespondence between the hardness of approximate counting and sampling with\nstatistical physics phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 04:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

For a S = 1 open chain, we show that Majorana\nfermion edge states exist in our mean field theory. The generalization to spins\nwith arbitrary magnitude S is discussed. Our approach can be applied to higher\ndimensional spin systems. As an example, we study the geometrically frustrated\nS = 1 AFM on triangular lattice. Two spin liquids with different pairing\nsymmetries are discussed: the gapped px + ipy-wave spin liquid and the gapless\nf-wave spin liquid. We compare our mean field result with the experiment on\nNiGa2S4, which remains disordered at low temperature and was proposed to be in\na spin liquid state. Our fermionic mean field theory provide a framework to\nstudy S > 1/2 spin liquids with fermionic spinon excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 08:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 02:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-28"}

It has\nresisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent\nnumber of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It\nappears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in\nstudy. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to\nobjectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We\nhave undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56\nlow-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four\nparameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged\nover effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with\nseven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not\nacross its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane,\nwhich is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the\nglobal fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of\nseveral groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different\nthicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification\nscenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number\nand the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the\nresult of several transforming events. We also show that our classification,\nnot the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 -\n0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes\npresumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese)\nmerger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low\nmetallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone\ndry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly\noccupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and\nmight also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least\ndiversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been\nstrongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of\nthese groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on\nspecific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they\nare truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables,\nthus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario\nrelating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but\nis objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our\nclassification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and\nour work can be readily repeated with additional observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 09:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-15"}

However, the likely thermal emission\ndetected from the millisecond pulsar J0437-4715, of spin-down age $t_s \\sim\n7\\times10^9$ yr, implies a temperature $T\\sim 10^5$ K. Thus, a heating\nmechanism needs to be added to the cooling models in order to obtain agreement\nbetween theory and observation. Aims: Several internal heating mechanisms could\nbe operating in neutron stars, such as magnetic field decay, dark matter\naccretion, crust cracking, superfluid vortex creep, and non-equilibrium\nreactions (\"rotochemical heating\"). We study these mechanisms in order to\nestablish which could be the dominant source of thermal emission from old\npulsars. Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark\nmatter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a\nsignificant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other\nmechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\\'andez and Reisenegger. Given the\ndependence of the heating mechanisms on the spin-down parameters, we study the\nthermal evolution for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating \"classical\"\npulsars and old, fast rotating millisecond pulsars. Results: We find that\nmagnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce\ndetectable heating of old pulsars. Rotochemical heating and vortex creep can be\nimportant both for classical pulsars and millisecond pulsars. More restrictive\nupper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out\nvortex creep as the main source of thermal emission. Rotochemical heating in\nclassical pulsars is driven by the chemical imbalance built up during their\nearly spin-down, and therefore strongly sensitive to their initial rotation\nperiod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 15:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 18:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2010 18:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
