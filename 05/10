We show that galactic superwind (GSW) feedback can\ntransport metals to the IGM and that the properties of simulated metal\nabsorbers match observations. The distance of influence of GSW is typically\nlimited to >0.5Mpc and within regions of overdensity >10. Most CIV and OVI\nabsorbers are located within shocked regions of elevated temperature\n(T>2x10^4K), overdensity (>10), and metallicity ([-2.5,-0.5]). OVI absorbers\nhave typically higher metallicity, lower density and higher temperature than\nCIV absorbers. For OVI absorbers collisional ionization dominates over the\nentire redshift range z=0-6, whereas for CIV absorbers the transition occurs at\nmoderate redshift z~3 from collisionally dominated to photoionization\ndominated. We find that the observed column density distributions for CIV and\nOVI in the range log N cm^2=12-15 are reasonably reproduced by the simulations.\nThe evolution of mass densities contained in CIV and OVI lines, Omega_CIV and\nOmega_OVI, is also in good agreement with observations, which shows a near\nconstancy at low redshifts and an exponential drop beyond redshift z=3-4. For\nboth CIV and OVI, most absorbers are transient and the amount of metals probed\nby CIV and OVI lines of column log N cm^2=12-15 is only ~2% of total metal\ndensity at any epoch. While gravitational shocks from large-scale structure\nformation dominate the energy budget (80-90%) for turning about 50% of IGM to\nthe warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) by z=0, GSW feedback shocks are\nenergetically dominant over gravitational shocks at z > 1-2.

In this work, we aim at linking cellular decisions taking place on a\ntime scale of years to decades with the biochemical dynamics in signal\ntransduction and gene regulation, occuring on a time scale of minutes to hours.\nWe show that a stochastic bistable switch forms a viable biochemical mechanism\nto implement decision processes on long time scales. As a case study, the\nmechanism is applied to model the initiation of follicle growth in mammalian\novaries, where the physiological time scale of follicle pool depletion is on\nthe order of the organism's lifespan. We construct a simple mathematical model\nfor this process based on experimental evidence for the involved genetic\nmechanisms. Despite the underlying stochasticity, the proposed mechanism turns\nout to yield reliable behavior in large populations of cells subject to the\nconsidered decision process. Our model explains how the physiological time\nconstant may emerge from the intrinsic stochasticity of the underlying gene\nregulatory network. Apart from ovarian follicles, the proposed mechanism may\nalso be of relevance for other physiological systems where cells take binary\ndecisions over a long time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 07:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-11"}

In\nparticular, highly transcribed genes, RNA polymerases and transcription factors\ngather into discrete spatial foci called transcription factories. However, the\nmechanisms underlying the formation of these foci and the resulting topological\norder of the chromosome remain to be elucidated. Here we consider a\nthermodynamic framework based on a worm-like chain model of chromosomes where\nsparse designated sites along the DNA are able to interact whenever they are\nspatially close-by. This is motivated by recurrent evidence that there exists\nphysical interactions between genes that operate together. Three important\nresults come out of this simple framework. First, the resulting formation of\ntranscription foci can be viewed as a micro-phase separation of the interacting\nsites from the rest of the DNA. In this respect, a thermodynamic analysis\nsuggests transcription factors to be appropriate candidates for mediating the\nphysical interactions between genes. Next, numerical simulations of the polymer\nreveal a rich variety of phases that are associated with different topological\norderings, each providing a way to increase the local concentrations of the\ninteracting sites. Finally, the numerical results show that both\none-dimensional clustering and periodic location of the binding sites along the\nDNA, which have been observed in several organisms, make the spatial\nco-localization of multiple families of genes particularly efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 10:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-11"}

These excitations are termed polaritons\nand are superpositions of photons and atomic excitations. We introduce\npolariton quasiparticles as appropriate linear combinations of both particle\nspecies and analyze the weights of their constituents. Our results demonstrate\nthe dependence of the quantum phase transition and the elementary excitations\non the number of atomiclike structures per cavity and provide thus valuable\ninsight into the physics of light-matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 11:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 08:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that is\ncurrently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula are\nrecombining. From the PACS and SPIRE images we conclude that there is a\nstriking resemblance between the dust distribution and the H2 emission, which\nappears to be observational evidence that H2 forms on grain surfaces. We have\ndeveloped a photoionization model of the nebula with the Cloudy code which we\nused to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possible\nformation scenarios for the H2. We conclude that the most plausible scenario is\nthat the H2 resides in high density knots which were formed after the\nrecombination of the gas started when the central star entered the cooling\ntrack. Hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of the\nrecombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. H2 formation\nin the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent a\nstrong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still be\nongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and the\nproperties of the grains in the knots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 11:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Many of these clouds are likely to be pristine\nstructures representing the initial conditions for star formation.

These fundamental quantities, are essential for\nunderstanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of the\nformation of stars in molecular clouds. We have developed a simple\npixel-by-pixel SED fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.\nBy fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatial\nvariations in both the dust column density and temperature within the IRDCs.\nThis method is applied to a sample of 22 IRDCs exhibiting a range of angular\nsizes and peak column densities. Our analysis shows that the dust temperature\ndecreases significantly within IRDCs, from background temperatures of 20-30 K\nto minimum temperatures of 8-15 K within the clouds, showing that dense\nmolecular clouds are not isothermal. Temperature gradients have most likely an\nimportant impact on the fragmentation of IRDCs. Local temperature minima are\nstrongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach NH2 =\n1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellar\ncores. Applying this technique to the full Hi-GAL data set will provide\nimportant constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of IRDCs, and\nhelp identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 11:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The method, based on\nNitroxide-Mediated Polymerization (NMP), consists to bind covalently the\nalkoxyamine, which acts as initiator controller agent, at the silica\nnanoparticles surface in two steps. The first step is a reaction between the\naminopropylsilane and the silica particles in order to functionalize the\nparticles surface with amino group. In a second step, the\ninitiating-controlling alkoxyamine moiety is introduced via an over grafting\nreaction between the amino group and the N-hydroxysuccinimide based MAMA-SG1\nactivated ester. To simplify both their chemical transformation and the\npolymerization step, the native silica particles, initially dispersed in water,\nhave been transferred in an organic solvent, the dimethylacetamide, which is\nalso a good solvent for the polystyrene. The synthesis parameters have been\noptimized for grafting density, conversion rates, and synthesis reproducibility\nwhile keeping the colloidal stability and to avoid any aggregation of silica\nparticles induced by the inter-particles interaction evolution during the\nsynthesis. After synthesis, the final grafted objects have been purified and\nthe non-grafted polymer chains formed in the solvent have been washed out by\nultra filtration. Then the particles have been studied using Small angle\nNeutron Scattering (SANS) coupled to neutron contrast variation method. To\noptimize the contrast conditions, both hydrogenated and deuterated monomers\nhave been used for the synthesis. A refined fitting analysis based on the\ncomparison on two models, a basic core-shell and the Gaussian Pedersen model,\nenables us to fit nicely the experimental data for both the hydrogenated and\ndeuterated grafted case. Differences are seen between grafting of normal or\ndeuterated chains which can be due to monomer reactivity or to neutron contrast\neffect variations. The synthesis and the characterization method established in\nthis work constitute a robust and reproducible way to design well defined\ngrafted polymer nanoparticles.

Lysozyme is a\nglobular protein and pectin a natural anionic semiflexible polysaccharide with\na degree of methylation (DM) 0, 43 and 74. For our experimental conditions\n(buffer ionic strength I = 2.5 10-2 mol/L and pH between 3 and 7), the\nelectrostatic charge of lysozyme is always positive (from 8 to 17 depending on\npH). The pectin charge per elementary chain segment is negative and can be\nvaried from almost zero to one through the change of DM and pH. The weight\nmolar ratio of lysozyme on pectin monomers is kept constant. The ratio of\nnegative charge content per volume to positive charge content per volume, -/+,\nis varied between 10 and 0.007. On a local scale, for all charged pectins, a\ncorrelation peak appears at 0.2 {\\AA}-1 due to proteins clustering inside the\ncomplexes. On a large scale, the complexes appear as formed of spherical\nglobules with a well defined radius of 10 to 50 nm, containing a few thousands\nproteins. The volume fraction Phi of organic matter within the globules derived\nfrom SANS absolute cross-sections is around 0.1. The protein stacking, which\noccurs inside the globules, is enhanced when pectin is more charged, due to pH\nor DM. The linear charge density of the pectin determines the size of the\nglobules for pectin chains of comparable molecular weights whether it is\ncontrolled by the pH or the DM. The radius of the globules varies between 10 nm\nand 50 nm. In conclusion the structure is driven by electrostatic interactions\nand not by hydrophobic interactions. The molecular weight also has a large\ninfluence on the structure of the complexes since long chains tend to form\nlarger globules. This maybe one reason why DM and pH are not completely\nequivalent in our system since DM 0 has a short mass, but this may not be the\nonly one. For very low pectin charge (-/+ = 0.07), globules do not appear and\nthe scattering signals a gel-like structure.

RCW 120 is a well-studied, nearby Galactic HII region with ongoing\nstar formation in its surroundings. Previous work has shown that it displays a\nbubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer of\ncollected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. Given the well-defined\nphoto-dissociation region (PDR) boundary and collected layer, it is an\nexcellent laboratory to study the \"collect and collapse\" process of triggered\nstar formation. Using Herschel Space Observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,\nand 500 micron, in combination with Spitzer and APEX-LABOCA data, we can for\nthe first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an HII region at\nhigh angular resolution. Aims. We seek a better understanding of RCW120 and its\nlocal environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. Additionally,\nwe wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to the\ndust temperature. Methods. We determine dust temperatures in selected regions\nof the RCW 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED),\nderived using aperture photometry. Additionally, we fit the SED extracted from\na grid of positions to create a temperature map. Results. We find a gradient in\ndust temperature, ranging from >30 K in the interior of RCW 120, to ~20K for\nthe material collected in the PDR, to ~10K toward local infrared dark clouds\nand cold filaments. Our results suggest that RCW 120 is in the process of\ndestroying the PDR delineating its bubble morphology. The leaked radiation from\nits interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. We\nfind support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,\nin rough agreement with what has been found previously. The extended wavelength\ncoverage of the Herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 14:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Through an image processing pipeline that takes advantage\nfrom the high resolution (~ 0.4 ''/pix) and high dynamic range of the SDSS\nimages, a uniform g band morphological classification for all these galaxies is\npresented. We identify 80% (SaSm) spirals (50% later than Sbc types) on one\nhand, and a scarce population of early-type E(6.5%) and S0(8%) galaxies\namounting to 14.5% on the other hand. This magnitude-limited catalog is ~ 80%\ncomplete at 16.5, 15.6, 15.0, 14.6 and 14.4 magnitudes in the ugriz bands\nrespectively. Some representative physical properties including SDSS magnitudes\nand color distributions, color-color diagrams, absolute magnitude-color, and\nconcentration-color diagrams as a function of morphological type are presented.\nThe UNAM-KIAS Morphological Atlas is also released along with this paper. For\neach galaxy of type later than Sa, a mosaic is presented that includes: (1) a\ng-band logarithmic image, (2) a g band filtered-enhanced image where a Gaussian\nkernel of various sizes was applied and (3) an RGB color image from the SDSS\ndatabase. For E/S0/Sa galaxies, in addition to the images in (1), (2) and (3),\nplots of r band surface brightness and geometric profiles (ellipticity,\nPosition Angle PA and A4/B4 coefficients of the Fourier series expansions of\ndeviations of a pure ellipse) are provided...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 14:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Thus, understanding\nhow nanoconfinement affects polymer properties has been the focus of a lot of\nresearch for over a decade. Polystyrene in particular has been reported to be\nstrongly affected when nanoconfined as a thin film and specifically its glass\ntransition temperature (Tg) is reported to decrease with decreasing film\nthickness. Tremendous effort has been dedicated to developing methods for\nquantifying the large-scale dynamic of nanoconfined polymers: film dewetting,\nfilm contraction, nanobubble inflation, nanoparticle imbedding and healing of\ndeformed surfaces etc. In this work we describe a novel method to study the\nlarge scale dynamic and nanomechanical properties of nanoconfined polymers in\nnanoparticles in nanoblends. Nanoblends of dPS/PBMA were prepared from a\nmixture of colloidal suspensions of cross-linked PBMA and traces of dPS\nnanoparticles via water evaporation. The polymer blends were prepared at\ntemperatures well below the glass transition of PS (TgPS) and above the Tg of\ncross-linked PBMA particles (TgPBMA). In these conditions we expect the PBMA\nparticles to deform under capillary pressure to fill the interstices between\nthem and the glassy PS nanoparticles to remain spherical. During the\npreparation of the nanoblends the elastic energy is stored within the deformed\ncross-linked PBMA nanoparticles. Upon annealing the films above TgPS, the PBMA\nnanoparticles regain their spherical shape and release the stored elastic\nenergy, which induces the deformation of the PS nanoparticles. Small angle\nneutron scattering is then used to monitor the shape evolution of the PS\nnanoparticles and to quantify the relaxation dynamics of the polystyrene\nnanoparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 15:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}
