These results are generally compared to jet\ncorrelations in p+p collsisions where all correlation strength is attributed to\nvacuum fragmentation. Strong modification to di-jet correlations has been\nobserved in A+A collisions at RHIC, most notably for the away side jet. Many\ndifferent effects, including the opacity of the medium, its response to energy\ndeposited by partons as they propagate, and modifications to the parton\nfragmentation, are involved in producing the final correlation stuctures.\nUnderstanding the interplay between these various effects is essential to\ndeveloping a complete picture of the medium. Measurements of jet correlations\ninvolving direct photons provide a unique probe of jet fragmentation effects,\nas photons are not strongly interacting. Additionally, systematic studies of\nthe away side structure as a function of $p_{T}$, as well as attempts to\ninclude additional high $p_{T}$ trigger requirements, can help to distinguish\ndifferent energy loss mechanisms.

RCW 120 is a nearby Galactic\nHII region where triggered star formation occurs. This region is well-studied -\nthere being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. However, it is\nsurrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtain\nan unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establish\nwhether very young protostars are present. We attempt to identify all Young\nStellar Objects (YSOs), especially those previously undetected at shorter\nwavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into the\nstar formation history in this region. We use Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE images\nto determine the distribution of YSOs observed in the field. We use a spectral\nenergy distribution fitting tool to derive the YSOs physical properties.\nHerschel-PACS and -SPIRE images confirm the existence of a young source and\nallow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 MSun) Class 0 object\n(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massive\ncondensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. This source was not\ndetected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the MISPGAL 70 micron data.\nSeveral other red sources are detected at Herschel wavelengths and coincide\nwith the peaks of the millimeter condensations. SED fitting results for the\nbrightest Herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive Class 0 that\nforms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around RCW 120. The\nYSOs observed on the borders of RCW 120 are younger than its ionizing star,\nwhich has an age of about 2.5 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 17:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This process is an example\nof ``gyroscopic pumping'', and has recently been studied in detail in the solar\ncontext. An important question concerns the extent to which these\ngyroscopically pumped meridional flows penetrate into nearby stably stratified\n(radiative) regions, since they could potentially be an important source of\nnon-local mixing. Here we present an extensive study of the gyroscopic pumping\nmechanism, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical\nsimulations both in Cartesian geometry and in spherical geometry. The various\nmethods, when compared with one another, provide physical insight into the\nprocess itself, as well as increasingly sophisticated means of estimating the\ngyroscopic pumping rate. As an example of application, we investigate the\neffects of this large-scale mixing process on the surface abundances of the\nlight elements Li and Be for stars in the mass range 1.3-1.5 solar masses\n(so-called ``Li-dip stars''). We find that gyroscopic pumping is a very\nefficient mechanism for circulating material between the surface and the deep\ninterior, so much in fact that it over-estimates Li and Be depletion by orders\nof magnitude for stars on the hot side of the dip.However, when the diffusion\nof chemical species back into the surface convection zone is taken into\naccount, a good fit with observed surface abundances of Li and Be as a function\nof stellar mass in the Hyades cluster can be found for reasonable choices of\nmodel parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 18:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We investigate\nthe coronal properties of a large sample of bright, disc-dominated galaxies\nextracted from the GIMIC suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations\nrecently presented by Crain et al. Remarkably, the simulations reproduce the\nobserved scalings of X-ray luminosity with K-band luminosity and star formation\nrate and, when account is taken of the density structure of the halo, with disc\nrotation velocity as well. Most of the star formation in the simulated galaxies\n(which have realistic stellar mass fractions) is fuelled by gas cooling from a\nquasi-hydrostatic hot corona. However, these coronae are more diffuse, and of a\nlower luminosity, than predicted by the analytic models of White & Frenk\nbecause of a substantial increase in entropy at z ~ 1-3. Both the removal of\nlow entropy gas by star formation and energy injection from supernovae\ncontribute to this increase in entropy, but the latter is dominant for halo\nmasses M_200 <~ 10^(12.5) Msun. Only a small fraction of the mass of the hot\ngas is outflowing as a wind but, because of its high density and metallicity,\nit contributes disproportionally to the X-ray emission. The bulk of the X-ray\nemission, however, comes from the diffuse quasi-hydrostatic corona which\nsupplies the fuel for ongoing star formation in discs today. Future deep X-ray\nobservations with high spectral resolution (e.g. with NeXT/ASTRO-H or IXO)\nshould be able to map the velocity structure of the hot gas and test this\nfundamental prediction of current galaxy formation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-29"}

Where is the\n(pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope H-band images\nand Spitzer Space Telescope 3.6 micron wavelength images, both calibrated to\n2MASS K_s band, to penetrate the prominent dust lane in NGC 4565. We find a\nhigh surface brightness, central stellar component that is clearly distinct\nfrom the boxy bar and from the disk. Its brightness profile is a Sersic\nfunction with index n = 1.55 +- 0.07 along the major axis and 1.33 +- 0.12\nalong the minor axis. Therefore it is a pseudobulge. It is much less luminous\nthan the boxy bar, so the true pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the\ngalaxy is PB/T = 0.06 +- 0.01, much less than the previously believed value of\nB/T = 0.4 for the boxy bulge.

We present our study of the ICL in Cl 0024+17 using both ACS and\nSubaru data, where we previously reported discovery of a ringlike dark matter\nstructure with gravitational lensing. The ACS images provide much lower sky\nlevels than ground data, and enable us to measure relative variation of surface\nbrightness reliably. This analysis is repeated with the Subaru images to\nexamine if consistent features are recovered despite different reduction scheme\nand instrumental characteristics. We find that the ICL profile clearly\nresembles the peculiar mass profile, which stops decreasing at r~50\" (~265 kpc)\nand slowly increases until it turns over at r~75\" (~397 kpc). This feature is\nseen in both ACS and Subaru images for nearly all available passband images\nwhile the features are stronger in red filters. The consistency across\ndifferent filters and instruments strongly rules out the possibility that the\nfeature might come from any residual, uncorrected calibration errors. In\naddition, our re-analysis of the cluster X-ray data shows that the peculiar\nmass structure is also indicated by a non-negligible bump in the intracluster\ngas profile when the geometric center of the dark matter ring, not the peak of\nthe X-ray emission, is chosen as the center of the radial bin. The location of\nthe gas ring is closer to the center by ~15\" (~80 kpc), raising an interesting\npossibility that the ring-like structure is expanding and the gas ring is\nlagging behind perhaps because of the ram pressure if both features in mass and\ngas share the same dynamical origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 20:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Vortices have the ability to sequester particles, with\ntypical radii from about 1 mm to 10 cm, that are slightly decoupled from the\ngas. A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature\nprofiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that\nfour vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the\nzones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small\nparticles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale\nnear and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles\ngrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. Older discs prefer to\ncapture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,\na phenomenon we term \"vortex aging\". More viscous, more dust-opaque and/or less\nmassive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of\nparticle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. Thus, how efficiently a\ndisc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between\ncoagulation and vortex aging. If vortices form in protoplanetary discs, they\nare important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to\ncondense out of the protostellar nebula. Particle capture also occurs at\ndistances relevant to planet formation.

The resultant spectrum shows weak HF emission from G10.6-0.4 at\nLSR velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption by\nforeground material at LSR velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. The spectrum\nis similar to that of the 1113.3430 GHz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,\nalthough at some frequencies the HF (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearly\nexceeds that of para-H2O.

However, in some\nexperiments the apparent width of the double-layer capacitor is substantially\nsmaller. We propose an alternate, non-mean-field theory of the ionic\ndouble-layer to explain such large capacitance values. Our theory allows for\nthe binding of discrete ions to their image charges in the metal, which results\nin the formation of interface dipoles. We focus primarily on the case where\nonly small cations are mobile and other ions form an oppositely-charged\nbackground. In this case, at small temperature and zero applied voltage dipoles\nform a correlated liquid on both contacts. We show that at small voltages the\ncapacitance of the double-layer is determined by the transfer of dipoles from\none electrode to the other and is therefore limited only by the weak\ndipole-dipole repulsion between bound ions, so that the capacitance is very\nlarge. At large voltages the depletion of bound ions from one of the capacitor\nelectrodes triggers a collapse of the capacitance to the much smaller\nmean-field value, as seen in experimental data. We test our analytical\npredictions with a Monte Carlo simulation and find good agreement. We further\nargue that our ``one-component plasma\" model should work well for strongly\nasymmetric ion liquids.

The relay nodes receive\nthe sum signal from S1 and S2 in the first time slot. In the second time slot,\neach relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and\nretransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a distributed\ntwo-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding,\neach receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the ``self-interference'' in the received\nsignal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the\n2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with\ndistributed beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity\nbetween the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region\nis characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we\ninvestigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a\nsum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal\nbeamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR\nminimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the\ncorresponding achievable rate region.

Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate\nregions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the\nindividual-power constraint case.

The gravitational potential at\nthe position of particle i (x_i,y_i,z_i), induced by particle j at\n(x_j,y_j,z_j), is given by: phi_ij = -G m_j/|r_ij^2+e_i^2+e_j^2|^1/2, where G\nis the gravitational constant, m_j is the mass of particle j, r_ij =\n|(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2|^1/2 and e_i and e_j are the gravitational\nsoftening lengths of particles i and j, respectively. This form is formally an\nextension of the Newtonian potential to five dimensions. The derivative of this\nequation in the x,y, and z directions correspond to the gravitational\naccelerations in these directions and these are always symmetric between two\nparticles.\n  When one applies this potential to a group of particles with different\nsoftening lengths, as is the case with a tree code, an averaged gravitational\nsoftening length for the group can be used. We find that the most suitable\naveraged softening length for a group of particles is <e_j^2> = sum_j^N m_j\ne_j^2 / M, where M = sum_j^N m_j and N are the mass and number of all particles\nin the group, respectively. The leading error related to the softening length\nis O(sum_j r_j d(e_j^2)/r_ij^3), where r_j is the distance between particle j\nand the center of mass of the group and d(e_j^2) = e_j^2 - <e_j^2>. Using this\naveraged gravitational softening length with the tree method, one can use a\nsingle tree to evaluate the gravitational forces for a system of particles with\na wide variety of gravitational softening lengths. Consequently, this will\nreduce the calculation cost of the gravitational force for such a system with\ndifferent softenings without the need for complicated forms of softening. We\npresent the result of simple numerical tests.

To this aim, a new technique\ncalled The HandOver Decision STAbility Technique (HODSTAT) is proposed for\nhorizontal handover in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) based on IEEE\n802.11standard. HODSTAT is based on a hysteresis margin analysis that, combined\nwith a utilitybased function, evaluates the need for the handover and\ndetermines if the handover is needed or avoided. Indeed, if a Mobile Terminal\n(MT) only transiently hands over to a better network, the gain from using this\nnew network may be diminished by the handover overhead and short usage\nduration. The approach that we adopt throughout this article aims at reducing\nthe minimum handover occurrence that leads to the interruption of network\nconnectivity (this is due to the nature of handover in WLAN which is a break\nbefore make which causes additional delay and packet loss). To this end, MT\nrather performs a handover only if the connectivity of the current network is\nthreatened or if the performance of a neighboring network is really better\ncomparing the current one with a hysteresis margin. This hysteresis should make\na tradeoff between handover occurrence and the necessity to change the current\nnetwork of attachment. Our extensive simulation results show that our proposed\nalgorithm outperforms other decision stability approaches for handover decision\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 08:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

A QoS and interference aware\nresource allocation is thus of special interest in order to respond to the\nheterogeneous constraints of the next generation networks.

The derivation and analysis of Dyson-Schwinger equations increase\nconsiderably in complexity when going beyond the standard Landau gauge fixing\nand the available tools have to be improved. For the derivation of the\nequations a computer program (DoDSE) was developed in order to handle the\nplethora of terms. The process of determining possible infrared solutions is\nabstracted to obtain further insight into the structure of the so-called\ninfrared scaling solutions. It is found that a few simple steps suffice to\ndetermine possible infrared scaling relations directly from the action. For the\nmaximally Abelian gauge an infrared enhanced diagonal gluon propagator is\nfound, while the off-diagonal degrees of freedom are infrared suppressed. This\nis in agreement with the idea of Abelian infrared dominance. Furthermore, it is\nproven that SU(2) and higher SU(N) have the same infrared behavior, although\nthe corresponding actions differ. Under a suitable truncation the\nDyson-Schwinger equations are solved in the deep infrared to obtain values for\nthe exponents of the power laws. Restricting the integration in field\nconfiguration space to the Gribov region of the Landau gauge with the\nGribov-Zwanziger action leads to two qualitatively equivalent infrared\nsolutions. In both cases the gluon propagator is infrared suppressed and the\ninfrared enhanced ghost propagator dominates the Dyson-Schwinger equations.\nThis result corroborates the conjecture by Zwanziger that the functional\nintegration can be cut at the first Gribov horizon and only the applied\nboundary conditions are important. For one solution the Dyson-Schwinger\nequations reduce in the deep infrared exactly to those obtained with the usual\nFaddeev-Popov gauge fixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 09:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We investigate this proposal\nover a wide range of DM density profiles, in the framework of concrete models\nwith doublet or triplet dark matter and a hidden SU(2) gauge sector that mixes\nwith standard model hypercharge. The gauge coupling is bounded from below by\nthe DM relic density, and the Sommerfeld enhancement factor is explicitly\ncomputable for given values of the DM and gauge boson masses M, mu and the\n(largest) dark matter mass splitting delta M_{12}. Sommerfeld enhancement is\nstronger at the galactic center than near the Sun because of the radial\ndependence of the DM velocity profile, which strengthens the inverse Compton\n(IC) gamma ray constraints relative to usual assumptions. We find that the\nPAMELA/Fermi/H.E.S.S. lepton excesses are marginally compatible with the model\npredictions, and with CMB and Fermi gamma ray constraints, for M ~ 800 GeV, mu\n~ 200 MeV, and a dark matter profile with noncuspy Einasto parameters alpha >\n0.20, r_s ~ 30 kpc.

In this approach one tries to describe not only the ground state but\nalso the first relevant excited states. In general, higher accuracy requires a\nlarger set of parameters, which must be carefully chosen to avoid redundancy.\nFollowing this line of development, it is unavoidable that the connection of\nthe functional with the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction becomes more and more\nelusive. In principle, the construction of a density functional from a density\nmatrix expansion based on the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction is\npossible, and indeed the approach has been followed by few authors. However, to\nwhat extent a density functional based on such a microscopic approach can reach\nthe accuracy of the fully phenomenological ones remains an open question. A\nrelated question is to establish which part of a functional can be actually\nderived by a microscopic approach and which part, on the contrary, must be left\nas purely phenomenological. In this paper we discuss the main problems that are\nencountered when the microscopic approach is followed.

In particular, the Halpha emission line consists of two broad\ncomponents of FWHM ~700 km/s and 2300 km/s, in addition to narrow components of\ntwo regions revealed from profiles of other lines.

The onset\nof H2 formation therefore has a strong effect on the temperature and chemical\nevolution in the post shock regions. We recently developed a model for H2\nformation on a graphite surface in warm conditions. The graphite surface acts\nas a model system for grains containing large areas of polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon structures. Here this model is used to obtain a new description of\nthe H2 formation rate as a function of gas temperature that can be implemented\nin molecular shock models. The H2 formation rate is substantially higher at\nhigh gas temperatures as compared to the original implementation of this rate\nin shock models, because of the introduction of H atoms which are chemically\nbonded to the grain (chemisorption). Since H2 plays such a key role in the\ncooling, the increased rate is found to have a substantial effect on the\npredicted line fluxes of an important coolant in dissociative shocks [O I] at\n63.2 and 145.5 micron.

We speculate that this\ntimescale is the same as that on which Ha emission is varying and is equal to\nthe rotation period of the star. The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field,\nmeasured during each of the three seasons, increases slowly from 100 to 150G,\nimplying that the polar strength of the putatively-dipolar large-scale magnetic\nfield of HD108 is at least 0.5kG and most likely of the order of 1-2 kG. The\nstellar and wind properties are derived through a quantitative spectroscopic\nanalysis with the code CMFGEN. The effective temperature is difficult to\nconstrain because of the unusually strong HeI4471 and HeI5876 lines. Values in\nthe range 33000-37000 K are preferred. A mass loss rate of about 1e-7 Msun/yr\n(with a clumping factor f=0.01) and a wind terminal velocity of 2000 km/s are\nderived. The wind confinement parameter eta_star is larger than 100, implying\nthat the wind of HD108 is magnetically confined. Stochastic short-term\nvariability is observed in the wind-sensitive lines but not in the photospheric\nlines, excluding the presence of pulsations. Material infall in the confined\nwind is the most likely origin for lines formed in the inner wind.\nWind-clumping also probably causes part of the Ha variability. The projected\nrotational velocity of HD108 is lower than 50 km/s, consistent with the\nspectroscopic and photometric variation timescales of a few decades. Overall,\nHD108 is very similar to the magnetic O star HD191612 except for an even slower\nrotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 15:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We\ngive several examples of binary and ternary subfield-subcodes of GT codes that\nare the best known codes of a given dimension and length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 15:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The logical reloading does not change propositions of the\nconception. However, generalizations of the conception are different for\ndifferent systems of basic concepts. It is conditioned by the fact, that some\nsystems of basic concepts contain not only propositions of the conception, but\nalso some attributes of this conception description. Properties of the logical\nreloading are demonstrated in the example of the proper Euclidean geometry,\nwhose generalization leads to different results for different system of basic\nconcepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 15:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 11:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-20"}

We also investigate the effects of both types of pumpings\n(Excitonic and Polaritonic) in the emission spectrum of the cavity. We show\nthat the polaritonic pumping as considered here is unable to modify the\ndynamical regimes of the system as the excitonics pumping does.

The framework is based on Hilbert spaces H of functions of\nfour space-time variables x,t, furnished with an additional indefinite inner\nproduct invariant under Poincar\\'e transformations, and isomorphisms of these\nspaces that preserve the indefinite metric. The indefinite metric is\nresponsible for breaking the symmetry between space and time variables and for\nselecting a family of Hilbert subspaces that are preserved under Galileo\ntransformations. Within these subspaces the usual quantum mechanics with\nSchr\\\"odinger evolution and t as the evolution parameter is derived.\nSimultaneously, the Minkowski space-time is isometrically embedded into H,\nPoincar\\'e transformations have unique extensions to isomorphisms of H and the\nembedding commutes with Poincar\\'e transformations. The main new result is a\nproof that the framework accommodates arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian space-times\nfurnished with the action of the diffeomorphism group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 20:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}
