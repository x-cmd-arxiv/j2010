In this paper we confirm and extend these studies at one- and\ntwo-point level, and present analytical results for a wide range of power-law\nspectra. We also consider two non-power law cases of interest: a blue spectrum\nwith an extended damping tail on small scales, which could be generated by the\nnon-linear mixing of density and vorticity; and a red spectrum with a damping\ntail on large scales. We then briefly consider the CMB impacts that result from\nsuch fields. While this paper focuses on the one- and two-point moments, the\ntechniques we employ are designed to ease the analysis of the full bispectra\ninduced by primordial magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 17:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

For electrons\nin gate defined GaAs quantum dots, previous spin echo measurements have\nrevealed coherence times of about 1 $\\mu$s at low magnetic fields below 100 mT.\nHere, we show that coherence in such devices can actually survive to much\nlonger times, and provide a detailed understanding of the measured nuclear spin\ninduced decoherence. At fields above a few hundred millitesla, the coherence\ntime measured using a single-pulse spin echo extends to 30 $\\mu$s. At lower\nmagnetic fields, the echo first collapses, but then revives at later times\ngiven by the period of the relative Larmor precession of different nuclear\nspecies. This behavior was recently predicted, and as we show can be\nquantitatively accounted for by a semi-classical model for the electron spin\ndynamics in the presence of a nuclear spin bath. Using a multiple-pulse\nCarr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill echo sequence, the decoherence time can be extended\nto more than 200 $\\mu$s, which represents an improvement by two orders of\nmagnitude compared to previous measurements.

The spirals\nlook very similar to the spirals seen in dwarf novae during outburst. DQ Her is\nthe first well established intermediate polar in which spirals are seen, that\nare in addition likely persistent because of the system's high mass transfer\nrate. Spiral structures give an alternative explanation for sidebands of the WD\nspin frequency that are found in IP light curves. The Doppler tomogram of He II\n4686 indicates that a large part of the emission is not disc-like. Spin trails\nof spectra reveal a pulsation in the He II 4686 emission that is believed to\nresult from reprocessing of X-rays from the white dwarf's magnetic poles in the\naccretion flow close to the WD. We confirm the previous finding that the\npulsation is only visible in the red-shifted part of the line when the beam\npoints to the back side of the disc. The absence of reprocessed light from the\nfront side of the disc can be explained by obscuration by the front rim of the\ndisc, but the absence of extra emission from the blue-shifted back side of the\ndisc is puzzling. Reprocessing in accretion curtains can be an answer to the\nproblem and can also explain the highly non-Keplerian velocity components that\nare found in the He II 4686 line.

Recent findings\nsuggest that tidal perturbations of typical circumstellar discs due to close\nencounters may inhibit rather than trigger disc fragmentation and so would seem\nto rule out planet formation by external tidal stimuli. However, the disc\nmodels in these calculations were restricted to disc radii of 40 AU and disc\nmasses below 0.1 M_sun. Here we show that even modest encounters can trigger\nfragmentation around 100 AU in the sorts of massive (~0.5 M_sun), extended\n(>=100 AU) discs that are observed around young stars. Tidal perturbation alone\ncan do this, no disc-disc collision is required. We also show that\nvery-low-mass binary systems can form through the interaction of objects in the\ndisc. In our computations, otherwise non-fragmenting massive discs, once\nperturbed, fragment into several objects between about 0.01 and 0.1 M_sun,\ni.e., over the whole brown dwarf mass range. Typically these orbit on highly\neccentric orbits or are even ejected. While probably not suitable for the\nformation of Jupiter- or Neptune-type planets, our scenario provides a possible\nformation mechanism for brown dwarfs and very massive planets which,\ninterestingly, leads to a mass distribution consistent with the canonical\nsubstellar IMF.

Here, we describe a novel methodology for\nutilising these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying\nSchmidt (SFR-rho^N) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the\npotential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily\nstar-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO\nstates than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-CO^alpha\nindex, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N.\nUtilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line\nradiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2\ndisc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed\nSFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in\nrelatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,\nresulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines. This means that an observed\n(e.g.) SFR-CO (J=3-2) relation does not map linearly to SFR-H2 relation. We\nutilise our model results to provide a mapping from alpha to N for the range of\nSchmidt indices N=1-2.

UBR (or UBVI) imaging covers five 36'x36'\nfields centred on bright z>3 QSOs, allowing ~21,000 2<z<3.5 galaxy candidates\nto be selected using the Lyman-break technique. We performed spectroscopic\nfollow-up using VIMOS, measuring redshifts for 1020 z>2 LBGs and 10 z>2 QSOs\nfrom a total of 19 VIMOS pointings. From the galaxy spectra, we observe a\n625+-510 km/s velocity offset between the ISM absorption and Ly-alpha emission\nline redshifts. Using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we have\nanalysed the galaxy clustering at z~3. In the photometric case, the angular\ncorrelation function, w(theta), is well fit by a double power-law with\nclustering scale-length, r_0 = 3.19+0.32-0.54 Mpc/h for r < 1 Mpc/h and r_0 =\n4.59+0.31-0.33 Mpc/h at larger scales.

Given sufficient\ninformation about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the\ntransformation can be accomplished with complexity O(L/G log(L/e)), where L is\nthe angular length of the path and e is a specified bound on the error of the\noutput state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first\nset of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an\nadditional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity\nalong the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and\ndoes not require continuity. Our methods have substantially better behavior\nthan conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They\nalso improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path\nlength and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of\nstate transformation along a path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 20:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

At these temperatures,\nthe streams should radiate primarily in the Lya line and have therefore been\nproposed as a model to power the extended, high-redshift objects known as Lya\nblobs and other high-redshift Lya sources. We introduce a new Lya radiative\ntransfer code, aRT, and apply it to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We\naddress physical and numerical issues that are critical to making accurate\npredictions for the cooling luminosity, but that have been mostly neglected or\ntreated simplistically so far. We highlight the importance of self-shielding\nand of properly treating sub-resolution models in simulations. Most existing\nsimulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead\nto order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a\ncombination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation\ntechniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the\nself-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lya cooling luminosity on\nhalo mass at z=3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion. While\ncooling in massive halos (without additional energy input from star formation\nand AGN) is in principle sufficient to produce L_alpha~10^43-10^44 erg s^-1\nblobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to\nform stars, but which is kept 100% gaseous in our optimistic estimates.\nExcluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one\nto two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the\nobserved Lya blobs with pure cooling. Resonant scattering produces diffuse Lya\nhalos, even for centrally concentrated emission, and broad double peaked line\nprofiles.

It may be expected\nthat these better abundances lead to a better understanding of the evolution of\nthese objects. Aims: The observed abundances in planetary nebulae are compared\nto those predicted by the models of Karakas (2003) in order to predict the\nprogenitor masses of the various PNe used. The morphology of the PNe is\nincluded in the comparison. Since the central stars play an important role in\nthe evolution, it is expected that this comparison will yield additional\ninformation about them. Methods: First the nitrogen/oxygen ratio is discussed\nwith relation to the helium/hydrogen ratio. The progenitor mass for each PNe\ncan be found by a comparison with the models of Karakas. Then the present\nluminosity of the central stars is determined in two ways: first by computing\nthe central star effective temperature and radius, and second by computing the\nnebular luminosity from the hydrogen and helium lines. This luminosity is also\na function of the initial mass so that these two values of initial mass can be\ncompared. Results: Six of the seven bipolar nebulae can be identified as\ndescendants of high mass stars (4Msun - 6Msun) while the seventh is ambiguous.\nMost of the elliptical PNe have central stars which descend from low initial\nmass stars, although there are a few caveats which are discussed. There is no\nobservational evidence for a higher mass for central stars which have a high\ncarbon/oxygen ratio. The evidence provided by the abundance comparison with the\nmodels of Karakas is consistent with the HR diagram to which it is compared. In\nthe course of this discussion it is shown how `optically thin' nebulae can be\nseparated from those which are 'optically thick'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 20:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We find that\nat moderately low temperatures the capacitance of the metal/ionic liquid\ninterface is so large that the effective thickness of the electrostatic\ndouble-layer is up to 3 times smaller than the ion radius. To interpret these\nresults we suggest an approach which is based on the interaction between\ndiscrete ions and their image charges in the metal surface and which therefore\ngoes beyond the mean-field approximation. When a voltage is applied across the\ninterface, the strong image attraction causes counterions to condense onto the\nmetal surface to form compact ion-image dipoles. These dipoles repel each other\nto form a correlated liquid. When the surface density of these dipoles is low,\nthe insertion of an additional dipole does not require much energy. This leads\nto a large capacitance $C$ that decreases monotonically with voltage $V$,\nproducing a \"bell-shaped\" curve $C(V)$. We also consider what happens when the\nelectrode is made from a semi-metal rather than a perfect metal.

While most\nterrestrial sensor networks can usually be modeled as two dimensional (2D)\nnetworks, these underwater sensor networks must be modeled as 3D networks. This\nleads to new research challenges in the area of network architecture and\ntopology. In this paper, we present two different network architectures for 3D\nunderwater sensor networks. The first one is a hierarchical architecture that\nuses a relatively small number of robust backbone nodes to create the network\nwhere a large number of inexpensive sensors communicate with their nearest\nbackbone nodes, and packets from a backbone node to the sink is routed through\nother backbone nodes. This hierarchical approach allows creating a network of\nsmaller number of expensive backbone nodes while keeping the mobile sensors\nsimple and inexpensive. Along with network topology, we also study energy\nefficiency and frequency reuse issues for such 3D networks. The second approach\nis a nonhierarchical architecture which assumes that all nodes are identical\nand randomly deployed. It partitions the whole 3D network space into identical\ncells and keeps one node active in each cell such that sensing coverage and\nconnectivity are maintained while limiting the energy consumed. We also study\ncloseness to optimality of our proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 23:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-19"}

The histogram of the flux densities of extracted sources\nshows a distinctive faint-end cutoff below which the catalog suffers from\nincompleteness and the flux densities become unreliable. This empirical cutoff\nshould be closely related to the estimated cirrus noise and we show that this\nis the case. We compute the cirrus noise directly, both on Herschel images from\nwhich the bright sources have been removed and on simulated images of cirrus\nwith statistically similar fluctuations. We connect these direct estimates with\nthose from power spectrum analysis, which has been used extensively to predict\nthe cirrus noise and provides insight into how it depends on various\nstatistical properties and photometric operational parameters. We report\nmulti-wavelength power spectra of diffuse Galactic dust emission from Hi-GAL\nobservations at 70 to 500 microns within Galactic plane fields at l= 30 degrees\nand l= 59 degrees. We find that the exponent of the power spectrum is about -3.\nAt 250 microns, the amplitude of the power spectrum increases roughly as the\nsquare of the median brightness of the map and so the expected cirrus noise\nscales linearly with the median brightness. Generally, the confusion noise will\nbe a worse problem at longer wavelengths, because of the combination of lower\nangular resolution and the rising power spectrum of cirrus toward lower spatial\nfrequencies, but the photometric signal to noise will also depend on the\nrelative spectral energy distribution of the source compared to the cirrus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 23:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Several parameters are suggested, e.g. the\nrelative content of carbon to oxygen (C/O) and the central density of the white\ndwarf (WD) at ignition. These parameters are mainly determined by the WD's\ninitial mass and its cooling time, respectively. Using the progenitor model\ndeveloped by Meng and Yang, we present the distributions of the initial WD mass\nand the cooling time.

The resulting cosmology shows the\npresence of an initial inflationary expansion, followed by a decelerating\nphase, and by a smooth transition towards a late accelerated de Sitter type\nexpansion. The varying brane tension is also responsible for the generation of\nthe matter in the Universe (reheating period). The physical constraints on the\nmodel parameters, resulted from the observational cosmological data, are also\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 04:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

Expansion of\nthe classical electrodynamics is based on the hypothesis about an existing new\n4-scalar potential complementary to the 4-vector electrodynamic potential.\n4-scalar potential, from the viewpoint of the quantum field concept, describes\nmassless scalar particles with a zero spin whose superposition realizes the\nCoulomb field. In a nonrelativistic approximation this hypothesis leads to the\ntheory in which along with the electric and magnetic fields there arises a new\nscalar field that can propagate jointly with the electric field in vacuum in\nthe form of a longitudinal electroscalar wave and, thus, transport of the\nCoulomb field is carried out. Indicative of the arising complementary scalar\nfield is the analogy between the linear theory of elasticity and Maxwell\nelectrodynamics considered in this work. From this analogy it follows that full\nagreement between the Lame equations and Maxwell equations is reached under the\ncondition of incompressibility of the elastic continuum, while describing the\ncompressible continuum necessitates introduction of a new scalar field. Since\nthe 4-vector electrodynamic and new 4-scalar potentials do not form a single\ngeometric object in the Minkowski space-time, in a nonrelativistic\napproximation the electromagnetic and electroscalar fields appear to be\nindependent and do not interfere. In the paper, the problem of interaction of\nthe introduced scalar field with charges and currents is also considered and\nelectrodynamics based on the Fock and Podolsky Lagrangian is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 09:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-19"}

These\ndebris discs commonly display a variety of structural features such as clumps,\nrings, belts, eccentric distributions and spiral patterns. In most cases, these\nfeatures are believed to be formed, shaped and maintained by the dynamical\ninfluence of planets orbiting the host stars. In very few cases has the\npresence of the dynamically important planet(s) been inferred from direct\nobservation. The solar-type star q1 Eri is known to be surrounded by debris,\nextended on scales of < 30''. The star is known to host at least one planet,\nalbeit on an orbit far too small to make it responsible for structures at\ndistances of tens to hundreds of AU. The aim of the present investigation is\ntwofold: to determine the optical and material properties of the debris and to\ninfer the spatial distribution of the dust, which may hint at the presence of\nadditional planets. The photodetector array camera and spectrometer (PACS)\naboard the Herschel Space Observatory allows imaging observations in the far\ninfrared at unprecedented resolution, i.e. at better than 6'' to 12'' over the\nwavelength range of 60 {\\mu}m to 210 {\\mu}m.

We find that the\nreionization history of the Local Group is strongly dependent on the assumed\nphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorly\nconstrained. If sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is\n'photon-rich', the Local Group is primarily ionized externally by the nearby\nclusters. Alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is\n'photon-poor' the Local Group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.\nThe mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications for\nthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxy\npopulations and primordial stellar populations. This therefore provides an\nimportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies of\nour nearby structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 10:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Since there are efficient\nmethods to solve large-scale bound constrained nonlinear programs, it is\ndesirable to adapt these methods to solve knapsack problems, while preserving\ntheir efficiency and convergence theories. The goal of this paper is to\nintroduce a general framework to extend a box-constrained optimization solver\nto solve knapsack problems. This framework includes two main ingredients which\nare O(n) methods; in terms of the computational cost and required memory; for\nthe projection onto the knapsack constrains and the null-space manipulation of\nthe related linear constraint. The main focus of this work is on the extension\nof Hager-Zhang active set algorithm (SIAM J. Optim. 2006, pp. 526--557). The\nmain reasons for this choice was its promising efficiency in practice as well\nas its excellent convergence theories (e.g., superlinear local convergence rate\nwithout strict complementarity assumption). Moreover, this method does not use\nany explicit form of second order information and/or solution of linear systems\nin the course of optimization which makes it an ideal choice for large-scale\nproblems. Moreover, application of Birgin and Mart{\\'\\i}nez active set\nalgorithm (Comp. Opt. Appl. 2002, pp. 101--125) for knapsack problems is also\nbriefly commented.

We construct self-consistent models of nonspherical\nisothermal halos embedding a zero-thickness disk, by assuming that the halo\ndistribution function is a Maxwellian. The method developed here can be used to\nstudy other physically-based choices for the halo distribution function and the\ncase of a disk accompanied by a bulge. In a preliminary investigation we note\nthe existence of a fine tuning between the scalelengths R_{\\Omega} and h,\nrespectively characterizing the rise of the rotation curve and the luminosity\nprofile of the disk, which surprisingly applies to both high surface brightness\nand low surface brightness galaxies. This empirical correlation identifies a\nmuch stronger conspiracy than the one required by the smoothness and flatness\nof the rotation curve (disk-halo conspiracy). The self-consistent models are\ncharacterized by smooth and flat rotation curves for very different\ndisk-to-halo mass ratios, hence suggesting that conspiracy is not as dramatic\nas often imagined. For a typical rotation curve, with asymptotically flat\nrotation curve at V_{\\infty} (the precise value of which can also be treated as\na free parameter), and a typical density profile of the disk, self-consistent\nmodels are characterized by two dimensionless parameters, which correspond to\nthe dimensional scales (the disk mass-to-light ratio M/L and the halo central\ndensity) of standard disk-halo decompositions. We show that if the rotation\ncurve is decomposed by means of our self-consistent models, the disk-halo\ndegeneracy is removed and typical rotation curves are fitted by models that are\nbelow the maximum-disk prescription. Similar results are obtained from a study\nof NGC 3198. Finally, we quantify the flattening of the spheroidal halo, which\nis significant, especially on the scale of the visible disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 10:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-10"}

The results of the 5 GHz VLBI observations and\ntotal flux densities of these sources are presented in this paper. From the\nVLBI morphologies, the spectral indices of components and the total flux\nvariability of the twelve targets, we firmly classify three sources J0210+0419,\nJ1135$-$0021, and J2058+0540 as CSOs, and classify J1057+0012, J1203+0414, and\nJ1600$-$0037 as core-jet sources.

A\nparticular class of nets, called C*-net bundles, is classified in terms of\nC*-dynamical systems having as group the fundamental group of the poset. Any\nnet of C*-algebras embeds into a unique C*-net bundle, the enveloping net\nbundle, which generalizes the notion of universal C*-algebra given by\nFredenhagen to nonsimply connected posets. This allows a classification of\nnets; in particular, we call injective those nets having a faithful embedding\ninto the enveloping net bundle. Injectivity turns out to be equivalent to the\nexistence of faithful representations. We further relate injectivity to a\ngeneralized Cech cocycle of the net, and this allows us to give examples of\nnets exhausting the above classification.

The SPI data from this period show a good signal to noise\nratio, allowing a detailed study of the spectral energy distribution up to\nseveral hundred keV.

This planet\nis orbiting a relatively faint G9V star called CoRoT-7, and we wish to refine\nits physical properties, which are important for the interpretation of the\nproperties of the planet system.

We use the Balmer lines to constrain Teff and pressure\nsensitive Mg-1b and Ca lines to constrain log g.

Our numerical analysis of the\ncontribution to the process coming from the photon exchange, pins impeccably\ndown a lower bound on Lambda_NC to be as high as around up to 900 (450) TeV,\ndepending on the estimates for the cosmogenic neutrino flux. If, on the other\nhand, one considers a surprising recent result occurred in Pierre Auger\nObservatory (PAO) data, that UHE cosmic rays are mainly composed of\nhighly-ionized Fe nuclei, then our bounds get weaker, due to the diminished\ncosmic neutrino flux.

XTE J1701-462 is the only example so\nfar of a source that during an outburst showed, beyond any doubt, spectral and\ntiming characteristics both of the Z and atoll type. We found that the lower\nkHz QPO in the atoll phase has a significantly higher coherence and fractional\nrms amplitude than any of the kHz QPOs seen during the Z phase, and that in the\nsame frequency range, atoll lower kHz QPOs show coherence and fractional rms\namplitude, respectively, 2 and 3 times larger than the Z kHz QPOs. Out of the\n707 observations in the Z phase, there is no single observation in which the\nkHz QPOs have a coherence or rms amplitude similar to those seen when XTE\nJ1701-462 was in the atoll phase, even though the total exposure time was about\n5 times longer in the Z than in the atoll phase. Since it is observed in the\nsame source, the difference in QPO coherence and rms amplitude between the Z\nand atoll phase cannot be due to neutron-star mass, magnetic field, spin,\ninclination of the accretion disk, etc. If the QPO frequency is a function of\nthe radius in the accretion disk in which it is produced, our results suggest\nthat in XTE J1701-462 the coherence and rms amplitude are not uniquely related\nto this radius. Here we argue that this difference is instead due to a change\nin the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star. Regardless of\nthe precise mechanism, our result shows that effects other than the geometry of\nspace time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the coherence and\nrms amplitude of the kHz QPOs, and therefore the coherence and rms amplitude of\nthe kHz QPOs cannot be simply used to deduce the existence of the innermost\nstable circular orbit around a neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 14:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We conclude that this\nprocess is unable to provide an effective mechanism for VHE $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from astrophysical sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 15:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 09:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

To test Bell inequalities two separated observers extract\ncorrelations from a common ensemble of identical systems. Since quantum theory\ndoes not allow simultaneous measurements of noncommuting observables, on each\nsystem every party measures a single randomly chosen observable out of a given\nset. Here we suggest a different approach for testing Bell inequalities that is\nexperimentally realizable by current methods. We show that Bell inequalities\ncan be maximally violated even when all observables are measured on each member\nof the ensemble. This is possible by using weak measurements that produce small\ndisturbance, at the expense of accuracy. However, our approach does not\nconstitute an independent test of quantum nonlocality since the local hidden\nvariables may correlate the noise of the measurement instruments. Nevertheless,\nby adding a randomly chosen precise measurement at the end of every cycle of\nweak measurements, the parties can verify that the hidden variables were not\ninterfering with the noise, and thus validate the suggested test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 15:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 08:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-19"}
