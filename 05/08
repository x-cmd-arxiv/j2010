Entanglement distillation [9, 10] can often counteract\nthese effects by converting imperfectly entangled states into a smaller number\nof maximally entangled states. States that are entangled but cannot be\ndistilled are called bound entangled [11]. Bound entanglement is central to\nmany exciting theoretical results in quantum information processing [12-14],\nbut has thus far not been experimentally realized. A recent claim for\nexperimental bound entanglement is not supported by their data [15]. Here, we\nconsider a family of four-qubit Smolin states [16], focusing on a regime where\nthe bound entanglement is experimentally robust. We encode the state into the\npolarization of four photons and show that our state exhibits both entanglement\nand undistillability, the two defining properties of bound entanglement. We\nthen use our state to implement entanglement unlocking, a key feature of Smolin\nstates [16].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 17:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 21:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-24"}

The ratio of disk mass over stellar mass in the\ncircumstellar phase of a disk is largely determined by the angular momentum of\nthe original cloud core from which the system was formed. While full 3D or 2D\naxisymmetric hydrodynamical models of accretion onto the disk automatically\ntreat all aspects of angular momentum, this is not so trivial for 1D and\nsemi-2D viscous disk models. Since 1D and semi-2D disk models are still very\nuseful for long-term evolutionary modelling of disks with relatively little\nnumerical effort, we investigate how the 2D nature of accretion affects the\nformation and evolution of the disk in such models. A proper treatment of this\nproblem requires a correction for the sub-Keplerian velocity at which accretion\ntakes place. We develop an update of our semi-2D time-dependent disk evolution\nmodel to properly treat the effects of sub-Keplerian accretion. The new model\nalso accounts for the effects of the vertical extent of the disk on the\naccretion streamlines from the envelope. The disks produced with the new method\nare smaller than those obtained previously, but their mass is mostly unchanged.\nThe new disks are a few degrees warmer in the outer parts, so they contain less\nsolid CO. Otherwise, the results for ices are unaffected. The 2D treatment of\nthe accretion results in material accreting at larger radii, so a smaller\nfraction comes close enough to the star for amorphous silicates to be thermally\nannealed into crystalline form. The lower crystalline abundances thus predicted\ncorrespond more closely to observed abundances than did earlier model\npredictions. We argue that thermal annealing followed by radial mixing must be\nresponsible for at least part of the observed crystalline material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 17:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the SiO enhancement. We\nhave imaged with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer the emission of the\nSiO(2-1) and CN(2--1) lines in NGC1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,\nrespectively. We have also obtained complementary IRAM 30m observations of HNCO\nand methanol (CH3OH) lines. SiO is detected in a disk of 400pc size around the\nAGN. SiO abundances in the CND of (1-5)xE-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitude\nabove those measured in the starburst ring. The overall abundance of CN in the\nCND is high: (0.2-1)xE-07. The abundances of SiO and CN are enhanced at the\nextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the AGN\n(r<70pc). Abundances measured for CN and SiO, and the correlation of CN/CO and\nSiO/CO ratios with hard X-ray irradiation, suggest that the CND of NGC1068 has\nbecome a giant X-ray dominated region (XDR). The extreme properties of\nmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of NGC1068 result from the\ninterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.\nWhereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation for CN and SiO in NGC1068,\nthe relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny. The inclusion of dust grain\nchemistry would help solve the controversy regarding the abundances of other\nmolecular species, like HCN, which are under-predicted by XDR models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 17:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We repeat the analysis\non the five-year WMAP data using a new estimator with lower bias and variance.\nOur results confirm this anomaly at higher significance, namely with a p-value\nof 0.31%. We perform the analysis using different exclusion masks, showing that\na particular region of the sky near the Galactic plane shows a higher variance\nthan 95.58% of the simulations whereas the rest of the sky has a lower variance\nthan 99.96% of the simulations. The relative difference in variance between\nboth regions is bigger than in 99.64% of the simulations. This anisotropic\ndistribution of power seems to be causing the anomaly since the model assumes\nisotropy. Furthermore, this region has a clear frequency dependence between\n41GHz and 61GHz or 94GHz suggesting that Galactic foreground residuals could be\nresponsible for the anomaly. Moreover, removing the quadrupole and the octopole\nfrom data and simulations the anomaly disappears. The variance anomaly and the\npreviously reported quadrupole and octopole alignment seem therefore to be\nrelated and could have a common origin. We discuss different possible causes\nand Galactic foreground residuals seem to be the most likely one. These\nresiduals would affect the estimation of the angular power spectrum from the\nWMAP data, which is used to generate Gaussian simulations, giving rise to an\ninconsistency between the estimated and expected CMB variance.

The end\npoint of this instability is a small hairy black hole that we construct\nanalytically in a perturbative expansion in its charge.

To regain ordinary Einstein-Cartan\ngravity the symmetry must be broken, which can be accomplished by known\nquasi-dynamic mechanisms. Motivated by symmetry breaking models in particle\nphysics and condensed matter systems, we propose that the symmetry can\nnaturally be broken by a homogenous and isotropic fermionic condensate of\nordinary spinors. We demonstrate that the condensate is compatible with the\nEinstein-Cartan equations and can be imposed in a fully de Sitter invariant\nmanner. This lends support, and provides a physically realistic mechanism for\nunderstanding gravity as a gauge theory with a spontaneously broken local de\nSitter symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 20:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

Despite its importance, however, dust remains poorly\nunderstood in terms of its origin, composition, and abundance throughout the\nuniverse. Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide a laboratory for studying the\nevolution of dust grains, as they are one of the only environments in the\nuniverse where it is possible to observe grains being both created and\ndestroyed. SNRs exhibit collisionally heated dust, allowing dust to serve as a\ndiagnostic both for grain physics and for the plasma conditions in the SNR. I\npresent theoretical models of collisionally heated dust which calculate grain\nemission as well as destruction rates. In these models, I incorporate physics\nsuch as nonthermal sputtering caused by grain motions through the gas, a more\nrealistic approach to sputtering for small grains, and arbitrary grain\ncompositions porous and composite grains. I apply these models to infrared and\nX-ray observations of Kepler's supernova and the Cygnus Loop in the galaxy, and\nSNRs 0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, and 0540-69.3 in the LMC. X-ray observations\ncharacterize the hot plasma while IR observations constrain grain properties\nand destruction rates. Such a multi-wavelength approach is crucial for a\ncomplete understanding of gas and dust interaction and evolution. Modeling of\nboth X-ray and IR spectra allows disentangling of parameters such as pre and\npostshock gas density, as well as swept-up masses of gas and dust, and can\nprovide constraints on the shock compression ratio. Observations also show that\nthe dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ISM is lower by a factor of several than what\nis inferred by extinction studies of starlight. Future observatories, such as\nthe James Webb Space Telescope and the International X-ray Observatory, will\nallow testing of models far beyond what is possible now.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 20:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-11"}

At the same time, the presence of a\nclassical electromagnetic field breaks down the exponential solution. In this\npaper we explore the role of the anomaly-induced term in the radiation sector\nand, furthermore, derive the ``equation of state'' and the scaling laws for all\nterms in the Einstein equations. As one could expect, the scaling law for the\nvacuum anomaly-induced effective action is the same as for the cosmological\nconstant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 23:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-27"}

In this paper, we focus on the\ninfluence of mass profile of the parent galaxy. The previous studies were done\nwith the simplification where the parent galaxy was expressed by point mass. We\nexpress different mass profiles of the parent galaxy by the tidal fields in\nwhich the ratios of the epicyclic frequency to the angular velocity are\ndifferent. We compare the mass-loss timescale of star clusters whose tidal\nradii are identical but in parent galaxies with different mass profile, by\nmeans of orbits calculations in fixed cluster potential and N-body simulations.\nIn this situation, a cluster rotates around the parent galaxy more rapidly as\nthe parent galaxy has shallower mass profile. We found that the mass-loss\ntimescale increase 20% and 50% for the cases that the mass density profile of\nthe parent galaxies are proportional to R^-2 and R^-1.5 where R is the distance\nfrom the galaxy center, compared to the point-mass case, in moderately strong\ntidal field. Counterintuitively, a cluster which rotates around the parent\ngalaxy more rapidly has a longer lifetime. The increase of lifetime is due to\nthe fact that the fraction occupied by regular-like orbit increases in\nshallower profile. Finally, we derive an evaluation formula for the mass-loss\ntimescale of clusters. Our formula can explain a property of the population of\nthe observed galactic globular clusters that their half-mass radii become\nsmaller as their distances from the galactic center become smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 23:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Our concept of the asymptotic transmission group\ntime confirms the validity of the Wigner phase time in the opaque limit, as\nwell as the existence of the usual and generalized Hartman effects predicted on\nits basis. On the energy scale, this concept is valid everywhere in the high\nenergy region as well as in the low energy region, excepting resonance points\nand their neighborhoods. On the contrary, the Buttiker dwell time is valid, as\nthe transmission time, just only at the resonance points. Our concept of the\ntransmission dwell time predicts monotonous growth of the tunneling time when\nthe distance between the opaque barriers increases. By our approach only this\ntime scale yields the true time spent, on average, by transmitted particles in\nthe region occupied by the system. We explain why the asymptotic and local\ntransmission group times cannot play this role and why the concept of {\\it\ntransmission group} velocity lies beyond the scope of special relativity.

We\ndemonstrate that these effects can be understood from the increasing length\nscale of the plasmon modes (charge fluctuations), and their increasing\ncontribution to the molecular dipole polarizability and the dispersion\ninteraction, as the band gaps are reduced. This result calls into question\nmethods which invoke locality assumptions in deriving dispersion interactions\nbetween extended small-gap systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2010 11:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 11:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-17"}

This was conjectured to be realized by systems at m-axial Lifshitz\npoints; in support of this claim, scaling functions of two-point cumulants at\nthe uniaxial Lifshitz point of the three-dimensional ANNNI model were predicted\non the basis of this theory and found to be in excellent agreement with Monte\nCarlo results [Phys.

This article presents a new\nqualitative model for this first step mechanism in natural catalytic systems\nsuch as photosynthesis in green leaves. The model uses a concept of\nsemiconductor band gap engineering, such as the staggered energy band gap\nline-up in semiconductors. To explain the primary mechanism in natural\nphotosynthesis the proposal is the following: incident light is absorbed inside\nthe leaves causing charges separation. The only energetic configuration that\nallows charges separation under illumination is the staggered one between two\nmaterials or molecules. We explain why (e-, h+) interacting charges can be\nseparated by using an energy staggered configuration, under illumination.\nFollowing this model, the green light of plants can be seen as related to the\nspent energy for charges separation.

To this end, a controlled Web search experiment with forty-eight\nparticipants was conducted. Interaction logs were used to segment search tasks\nsemi-automatically into task stages.
