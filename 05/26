In this paper, we present a\nnew framework for analyzing the LWR model, especially the Riemann problem at a\nlinear boundary in which the upstream and downstream links are homogeneous and\ninitially carry uniform traffic. We first review the definitions of local\nsupply and demand functions and then introduce the so-called supply-demand\ndiagram, on which a traffic state can be represented by its supply and demand,\nrather than as density and flux as on a fundamental diagram. It is well-known\nthat the solutions to the Riemann problem at each link are self-similar with a\nstationary state, and that the wave on the link is determined by the stationary\nstate and the initial state. In our new framework, there can also exist an\ninterior state next to the linear boundary on each link, which takes\ninfinitesimal space, and admissible conditions for the upstream and downstream\nstationary and interior states can be derived in supply-demand space. With an\nentropy condition consistent with a local supply-demand method in interior\nstates, we show that the stationary states exist and are unique within the\nsolution framework. We also develop a graphical scheme for solving the Riemann\nproblem, and the results are shown to be consistent with those in the\nliterature. We further discuss asymptotic stationary states on an inhomogeneous\nring road with arbitrary initial conditions and demonstrate the existence of\ninterior states with a numerical example. The framework developed in this study\nis simpler than existing ones and can be extended for analyzing the traffic\ndynamics in general road networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 16:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-26"}

A Cat-operad is an operad enriched over the category Cat of\nsmall categories, as a 2-category with small hom-categories is a category\nenriched over Cat. The notion of weak Cat-operad is to the notion of Cat-operad\nwhat the notion of bicategory is to the notion of 2-category. The equations of\noperads like associativity of insertions are replaced by isomorphisms in a\ncategory. The goal of this paper is to formulate conditions concerning these\nisomorphisms that ensure coherence, in the sense that all diagrams of canonical\narrows commute. This is the sense in which the notions of monoidal category and\nbicategory are coherent. The coherence proof in the paper is much simplified by\nindexing the insertion operations in a context-independent way, and not in the\nusual manner.

Many surface maps in our\nphysical world are quasi-conformal. The angular distortion of a quasi-conformal\nmap can be represented by Beltrami differentials. According to quasi-conformal\nTeichm\\\"uller theory, there is an 1-1 correspondence between the set of\nBeltrami differentials and the set of quasi-conformal surface maps. Therefore,\nevery quasi-conformal surface map can be fully determined by the Beltrami\ndifferential and can be reconstructed by solving the so-called Beltrami\nequation.\n  In this work, we propose an effective method to solve the Beltrami equation\non general Riemann surfaces. The solution is a quasi-conformal map associated\nwith the prescribed Beltrami differential. We firstly formulate a discrete\nanalog of quasi-conformal maps on triangular meshes. Then, we propose an\nalgorithm to compute discrete quasi-conformal maps. The main strategy is to\ndefine a discrete auxiliary metric of the source surface, such that the\noriginal quasi-conformal map becomes conformal under the newly defined discrete\nmetric. The associated map can then be obtained by using the discrete Yamabe\nflow method. Numerically, the discrete quasi-conformal map converges to the\ncontinuous real solution as the mesh size approaches to 0.

Using Ford\ncircles of Farey sequences we find lifts to the Standard Fundamental Region\n(SFR) and find points of these lifts making given angles with a horizontal.\nNext, we offer two methods, both involving continued fractions, of locating\npoints with such angles whose lifts are near any given point in the SFR. This\nestablishes in an effective manner a sort of transitivity, which necessarily\ninvolves infinitely many such horocycles.\n  Next, we study the homotopy classes of horizontal horocycles as we descend to\nthe real axis. We find these are stable during descent between encounters of\nthe horizontal with elliptic fixed points. Such encounters change - complicate\n- the homotopy classes.

For this specific\nsetting of the Flux Cancellation Model describing coronal mass ejections\noccuring in active regions, we address the issues of the physical meaning of\nflux decrease, of the influence on field evolution of the size of the domain\nover which this decrease is imposed, and of the existence of an energetic\ncriterion characterizing the possible onset of disruption of the configuration.\nWe show that: (1) The imposed flux disappearance can be interpreted in terms of\ntransport of positive and negative fluxes towards the inversion line, where\nthey get annihilated. (2) For the particular case actually computed, in which\nthe initial state is quite sheared, the formation of a twisted flux rope and\nthe subsequent global disruption of the configuration are obtained when the\nflux has decreased by only a modest amount over a limited part of the whole\nactive region. (3) The disruption is produced when the magnetic energy becomes\nof the order of the decreasing energy of a semi-open field, and then before\nreaching the energy of the associated fully open field. This suggests that the\nmechanism leading to the disruption is nonequilibrium as in the case where flux\nis imposed to decrease over the whole region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 19:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We determine how large\nindirect signals may be in scenarios with Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation,\nsubject to the constraint that the dark matter has the correct relic density.\nThis work refines our previous analysis through detailed treatments of resonant\nSommerfeld enhancement and the effect of Sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out.\nSommerfeld enhancements raise many interesting issues in the freeze out\ncalculation, and we find that the cutoff of resonant enhancement, the\nequilibration of force carriers, the temperature of kinetic decoupling, and the\nefficiency of self-interactions for preserving thermal velocity distributions\nall play a role. These effects may have striking consequences; for example, for\nresonantly-enhanced Sommerfeld annihilation, dark matter freezes out but may\nthen chemically recouple, implying highly suppressed indirect signals, in\ncontrast to naive expectations.

Power spectral analysis over ~0.004-10 Hz is\npresented, and shows that although the average optical variability amplitude is\nlower than that in X-rays, the peak variability power emerges at a higher\nFourier frequency in the optical. Energetically, we measure a large optical vs.\nX-ray flux ratio, higher than that seen when the source was fully\njet-dominated. Such a large ratio cannot be easily explained with a disc alone.\nThe optical:X-ray cross-spectrum shows a markedly different behaviour above and\nbelow ~0.2 Hz. The peak of the coherence function above this threshold is\nassociated with a short optical time lag, also seen as the dominant feature in\nthe time-domain cross-correlation at ~150 ms. The rms energy spectrum of these\nfast variations is best described by distinct physical components over the\noptical and X-ray regimes, and also suggests a maximal disc fraction of 20% at\n~5000 A. If the constant time delay is due to propagation of fluctuations to\n(or within) the jet, this is the clearest optical evidence to date of the\nlocation of this component. The low-frequency QPO is seen in the optical but\nnot in X-rays. Evidence of reprocessing emerges at the lowest Fourier\nfrequencies, with optical lags at ~10 s and strong coherence in the blue u'\nfilter. Simultaneous optical spectroscopy also shows the Bowen fluorescence\nblend, though its emission location is unclear. But canonical disc reprocessing\ncannot dominate the optical power easily, nor explain the fast variability.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 20:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that the\nratio of the radiation pressure force to the gravitational force increases with\nheight above the disc surface to a maximum of twice the value of the ratio at\nthe disc surface. Thus, uniformly bright self-gravitating discs radiating at\nthe Eddington limit are fundamentally unstable to driving large-scale winds.\nThese results contrast with the spherically symmetric case, where\nsuper-Eddington luminosities are required for wind formation. We apply this\ntheory to galactic winds from rapidly star-forming galaxies that approach the\nEddington limit for dust.

The high resolution X-ray\nimaging reveals that the cluster emission is contaminated by point sources that\nwere not resolved in XMM observations of the system, and have the effect of\nhardening the spectrum, leading to the previously reported temperature for this\nsystem being overestimated. From a joint spectroscopic analysis of the Chandra\nand XMM data, the cluster is found to have temperature T=4.1_-0.9^+0.6 keV and\nluminosity L_X=(2.92_-0.35^+0.24)x10^44 erg/s extrapolated to a radius of 2\nMpc.

Our primary motivation is to model the wake dynamics in large fish\nschools. We ignore the fish and focus on the dynamic interaction of multiple\nwakes where each wake is modeled as a reverse von K'arm'an street. There exist\nconfigurations where the infinite array of vortex streets is in relative\nequilibrium, that is, the streets move together with the same translational\nvelocity. We examine the topology of the streamline patterns in a frame moving\nwith the same translational velocity as the streets which lends insight into\nfluid transport through the mid-wake region. Fluid is advected along different\npaths depending on the distance separating two adjacent streets. Generally,\nwhen the distance between the streets is large enough, each street behaves as a\nsingle von K'arm'an street and fluid moves globally between two adjacent\nstreets. When the streets get closer to each other, the number of streets that\nenter into partnership in transporting fluid among themselves increases. This\nobservation motivates a bifurcation analysis which links the distance between\nstreets to the maximum number of streets transporting fluid among themselves.\nWe also show that for short times, the analysis of streamline topologies for\nthe infinite arrays of streets can be expected to set the pattern for the more\nrealistic case of a finite array of truncated streets, which is not in an\nequilibrium state and its dynamic evolution eventually destroys the exact\ntopological patterns identified in the infinite array case.

By analytically and numerically\nsolving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation for spinless p-wave superfluids with\nplural vortices, it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle tunneling between\nneighboring vortices gives rise to the quantum oscillation of the low-lying\nspectra on the scale of the Fermi wavelength in addition to the exponential\nsplitting. This rapid oscillation, which appears in the weak coupling regime as\na consequence of quantum oscillations of quasiparticle wave functions,\ndisappears in the vicinity of the BCS-BEC topological phase transition. This is\nunderstandable from that the wave function of the Majorana zero modes is\ndescribed by the modified Bessel function in the strong coupling regime and\nthus it becomes spread over the vortex core region. Due to the exponential\ndivergence of the modified Bessel function, the concrete realization of the\nMajorana zero modes near the topological phase transition requires the\nneighboring vortices to be separated beyond the length scale defined by the\ncoherence length and the dimensionless coupling constant.

The main flow is expected to proceed away from the\nvalley of stability, eventually reaching the proton drip-line beyond A = 38.\nDetailed analysis of the relevant reactions along the main path has only been\nscarcely addressed, mainly in the context of parameterized one-zone models. In\nthis paper, we present a detailed study of the nucleosynthesis and nuclear\nprocesses powering type I X-ray bursts. The reported 11 bursts have been\ncomputed by means of a spherically symmetric (1D), Lagrangian, hydrodynamic\ncode, linked to a nuclear reaction network that contains 325 isotopes (from 1H\nto 107Te), and 1392 nuclear processes.

About half of the\nknown sdBs are in close binary systems for which common envelope ejection is\nthe most likely formation channel. Little is known about this dynamic phase of\nbinary evolution. Due to the tidal influence of the companion in close binary\nsystems, the rotation of the primary becomes synchronised to its orbital\nmotion. In this case it is possible to constrain the mass of the companion, if\nthe primary mass, its projected rotational velocity as well as its surface\ngravity are known. For the first time we measured the projected rotational\nvelocities of a large sdB binary sample from high resolution spectra. We\nanalysed a sample of 51 sdB stars in close binaries, 40 of which have known\norbital parameters comprising half of all such systems known today.\nSynchronisation in sdB binaries is discussed both from the theoretical and the\nobservational point of view. The masses and the nature of the unseen companions\ncould be constrained in 31 cases. The companions to seven sdBs could be clearly\nidentified as late M stars. One binary may have a brown dwarf companion. The\nunseen companions of nine sdBs are white dwarfs with typical masses. The mass\nof one white dwarf companion is very low. In eight cases the companion mass\nexceeds 0.9 solar masses, four of which even exceed the Chandrasekhar limit\nindicating that they may be neutron stars. Even stellar mass black holes are\npossible for the most massive companions. The distribution of the inclinations\nof the systems with low mass companions appears to be consistent with\nexpectations, whereas a lack of high inclinations becomes obvious for the\nmassive systems.

We therefore aim\nat investigating its central region for a putative starburst in the past and\nits connection to the AGN and the outflows. Observations were performed with\nthe adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the\nVLT, complemented by longslit observations with ISAAC on the VLT, as well as N-\nand Q-band data from the Spitzer archive. The spatial and spectral resolutions\nof the SINFONI data are 50 pc and 83 km/s, respectively. The field of view of\n3\" x 3\" corresponds to 450 pc x 450 pc. Br_gamma equivalent width and line\nfluxes from PAHs were compared to stellar population models to constrain the\nage of the putative recent star formation. A simple geometric model of two\nmutually inclined disks and an additional cone to describe an outflow was\ndeveloped to explain the observed complex velocity field in H_2 1-0S(1). The\nmorphologies of the Br_gamma and the stellar continuum are different suggesting\nthat at least part of the Br_gamma emission comes from the AGN. This is\nconfirmed by PAH emission lines at 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron and the strength\nof the silicon absorption feature at 9.7 micron, which point to dominant AGN\nactivity with a relatively minor starburst contribution. We find a starburst\nage of 40 Myr - 50 Myr from Br_gamma line diagnostics and the radio continuum;\nongoing star formation can be excluded. Both the energetics and the timescales\nindicate that the outflows are driven by the AGN rather than the starburst. The\ncomplex velocity field observed in H_2 1-0S(1) in the central 450 pc can be\nexplained by the superposition of the galaxy rotation and an outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 11:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Alternatively, low-energy cosmic rays propagating inside the clouds\nmight account for the observed emission, through inverse bremsstrahlung of low\nenergy ions or bremsstrahlung emission of low energy electrons. Here we report\nthe observation of a clear decay of the hard X-ray emission from the molecular\ncloud Sgr B2 during the past 7 years thanks to more than 20 Ms of INTEGRAL\nexposure.

Lett. 102, 065703 (2009)] and nuclear spin pumping in double quantum\ndots, which is mediated by the decay of a spin-blockaded electron triplet state\nin the presence of spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. The transition occurs\nwhen the strength of spin-orbit coupling exceeds the strength of the net\nhyperfine coupling, and results in the complete suppression of nuclear spin\npumping. Below the transition point, nuclear pumping is accompanied by a strong\nreduction in current due to the presence of non-decaying \"dark states\" in this\nregime. Due to its topological character, the transition is expected to be\nrobust against dephasing of the electronic degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 13:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}

The member agents of such systems may inadvertently fail\nto, or even deliberately choose not to, conform to the system specification.\nConsequently, it is necessary to specify the normative relations that may exist\nbetween the agents, such as permission, obligation, and institutional power.\nThe specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a\ndesign-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification\nmodification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is\noften required to revise the specification during the system execution. To\naddress this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic'\nspecifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the\nagents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a\nmodification of the `rules of the game', as well as decision-making over and\nenactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule\nmodification by modelling a dynamic specification as a metric space, and by\nconsidering the effects of accepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore,\nwe constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation\ncriteria.

We take\nmagnetic helicity evolution into account by solving a dynamical equation for\nthe magnetic alpha effect. This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This\ncatastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity\nfluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even\nfor Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux\nshow an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models\nwithout fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4. This is mainly a consequence of assuming\na vacuum outside the Sun which cannot support a significant VC flux across the\nboundary. However, in contrast with the diffusive flux, the VC flux modifies\nthe distribution of the magnetic field. In addition, if an ill-determined\nscaling factor in the expression for the VC flux is large enough, subcritical\ndynamo action is possible that is driven by the action of shear and the\ndivergence of current helicity flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 14:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-10"}

Spectral fit of the XMM-Newton data and of the RXTE data, taken in a\nsimultaneous temporal window, constrain the Comptonization parameters: the\nelectron temperature, kT_e=51(+6,-4) keV, is rather high, while the optical\ndepth (tau=1.34(+0.03,-0.06)) is moderate.

Population bursting, hereby\nregarded as a period of high firing rate followed by a period of quiescence, is\ntypically observed in groups of neurons during behavior. Biophysical\nmembrane-potential models of single cell bursting involve at least three\nequations. Extending such models to study the collective behavior of neural\npopulations involves thousands of equations and can be very expensive\ncomputationally. For this reason, low dimensional population models that\ncapture biophysical aspects of networks are needed.\n  \\noindent The present paper uses a firing-rate model to study mechanisms that\ntrigger and stop transitions between tonic and phasic population firing. These\nmechanisms are captured through a two-dimensional system, which can potentially\nbe extended to include interactions between different areas of the nervous\nsystem with a small number of equations. The typical behavior of midbrain\ndopaminergic neurons in the rodent is used as an example to illustrate and\ninterpret our results.\n  \\noindent The model presented here can be used as a building block to study\ninteractions between networks of neurons. This theoretical approach may help\ncontextualize and understand the factors involved in regulating burst firing in\npopulations and how it may modulate distinct aspects of behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 14:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Unfortunately, its performance is usually\ninferior to the all-digital, separation-based source-channel coding solution,\nwhich requires exact knowledge of the channel at the encoder. The loss comes\nfrom the fact that except for very special cases, e.g. white source and channel\nof matching bandwidth (BW), it is impossible to achieve perfect matching of\nsource to channel and channel to source by linear means. We show that by\ncombining prediction and modulo-lattice operations, it is possible to match any\ncolored Gaussian source to any colored Gaussian noise channel (of possibly\ndifferent BW), hence achieve Shannon's optimum attainable performance $R(D)=C$.\nFurthermore, when the source and channel BWs are equal (but otherwise their\nspectra are arbitrary), this scheme is asymptotically robust in the sense that\nfor high signal-to-noise ratio a single encoder (independent of the noise\nvariance) achieves the optimum performance. The derivation is based upon a\nrecent modulo-lattice modulation scheme for transmitting a Wyner-Ziv source\nover a dirty-paper channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2010 15:49:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2010 15:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-03"}
