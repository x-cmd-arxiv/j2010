The core of the method is the requirement that\nthe constructed quantities should fulfil the symmetries of the angular\ndistribution. We have identified all symmetries of the angular distribution in\nthe limit of massless leptons and explore: a new non-trivial relation between\nthe coefficients of the angular distribution, the possibility to fully solve\nthe system for the $K^{*}$ amplitudes, and the construction of non-trivial\nobservables. We also present a phenomenological analysis of the new physics\nsensitivity of angular observables in the decay based on QCD factorisation. We\nfurther analyse the CP-conserving observables, $A_{T}^{(2)}$, $A_{T}^{(3)}$ and\n$A_{T}^{(4)}$. They are practically free of theoretical uncertainties due to\nthe soft form factors for the full range of dilepton masses rather than just at\na single point as for $A_{FB}$. They also have a higher sensitivity to specific\nnew physics scenarios compared to observables such as $A_{FB}$. Moreover, we\ncritically examine the new physics reach of CP-violating observables via a\ncomplete error analysis due to scale dependences, form factors and\n$\\Lambda/m_b$ corrections. We have developed an ensemble method to evaluate the\nerror on observables from $\\Lambda/m_b$ corrections. Finally, we explore the\nexperimental prospects of CP-violating observables and find that they are\nrather limited. Indeed, the CP-conserving (averaged) observables $A_{T}^{(i)}$\n(with $i=2,3,4$) will offer a better sensitivity to large CP phases and may be\nmore suitable for experimental analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2010 16:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2011 14:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-03"}

Elementary examples are\npresented, and exact axisymmetric solutions for spherical, prolate spheroidal,\nand oblate spheroidal body shapes are provided. In each case, entirely and\npartially porous (i.e. jetting) surfaces are considered, and the optimal\njetting flow profiles at the surface for maximizing the hydrodynamic efficiency\nare determined computationally. The maximal efficiency which may be achieved by\na sphere using such jet propulsion is 12.5%, a significant improvement upon\ntraditional flagella-based means of locomotion at zero Reynolds number. Unlike\nother swimming mechanisms which rely on the presentation of a small cross\nsection in the direction of motion, the efficiency of a jetting body at low\nReynolds number increases as the body becomes more oblate, and limits to\napproximately 162% in the case of a flat plate swimming along its axis of\nsymmetry.

The results are rationalized with use\nof a concerted-coupling model (CCM), which has previously been applied\nsuccesfully to the description of adsorption on TiC(111) and TiN(111) surfaces\n[Solid State Commun. 141, 48 (2007)]. First, the clean TMC(111) surfaces are\ncharacterized by calculating surface energies, surface relaxations, Bader\ncharges, and surface-localized densities of states (DOS's). Detailed\ncomparisons between surface and bulk DOS's reveal the existence of\ntransition-metal localized SR's (TMSR's) in the pseudogap and of several\nC-localized SR's (CSR's) in the upper valence band on all considered TMC(111)\nsurfaces. Then, atomic and molecular adsorption energies, geometries, and\ncharge transfers are presented. An analysis of the adsorbate-induced changes in\nsurface DOS's reveals a presence of both adsorbate--TMSR and adsorbate--CSR's\ninteractions, of varying strengths depending on the surface and the adsorbate.\nThese variations are correlated to the variations in adsorption energies. The\nresults are used to generalize the content and applications of the previously\nproposed CCM to this larger class of substrates and adsorbates.

The\nperspectives offered by the capture of stars by supermassive black holes are to\nbe cherished, because the study of the motion of falling stars will constitute\na giant step forward in the understanding of gravitation in the regime of\nstrong field. After an account on the perception of free fall in ancient times\nand on the behaviour of a gravitating mass in Newtonian physics, this chapter\ndeals with last century debate on the repulsion for a Schwarzschild black hole\nand mentions the issue of an infalling particle velocity at the horizon.\nFurther, black hole perturbations and numerical methods are presented, paving\nthe way to the introduction of the self-force and other back-action related\nmethods. The impact of the perturbations on the motion of the falling particle\nis computed via the tail, the back-scattered part of the perturbations, or via\na radiative Green function. In the former approach, the self-force acts upon\nthe background geodesic; in the latter, the geodesic is conceived in the total\n(background plus perturbations) field. Regularisation techniques (mode-sum and\nRiemann-Hurwitz $z$ function) intervene to cancel divergencies coming from the\ninfinitesimal size of the particle. An account is given on the state of the\nart, including the last results obtained in this most classical problem,\ntogether with a perspective encompassing future space gravitational wave\ninterferometry and head-on particle physics experiments. As free fall is\npatently non-adiabatic, it requires the most sophisticated techniques for\nstudying the evolution of the motion. In this scenario, the potential of the\nself-consistent approach, by means of which the background geodesic is\ncontinuously corrected by the self-force contribution, is examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2010 19:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

All of them\ncan be separated into a bulk and a surface term, with a specific\n(\"holographic\") relationship between the two, so that either term can be used\nto extract information about the other. Further, the surface term leads to\nentropy of the horizons on-shell. It has been argued in the past that these\nfeatures are impossible to understand in the conventional approach but find a\nnatural explanation if we consider gravity as an emergent phenomenon. We\nprovide further support for this point of view in this paper. We describe an\nalternative decomposition of the Einstein-Hilbert action and Lanczos-Lovelock\naction into a new pair of surface and bulk terms, such that the surface term\nbecomes Wald entropy on a horizon and the bulk term is the energy density\n(which is the ADM Hamiltonian density for Einstein gravity). We show that this\nnew pair also obeys a holographic relationship and give a thermodynamic\ninterpretation to this relation in this context. Since the bulk and surface\nterms, in this decomposition, are related to energy and entropy, the\nholographic condition can be thought of as analogous to inverting the\nexpression for entropy given as a function of energy S = S(E,V) to obtain the\nenergy E = E(S,V) in terms of the entropy in a normal thermodynamic system.\nThus the holographic nature of the action allows us to relate the descriptions\nof the same system in terms of two different thermodynamic potentials.

Here we calculate the evolution of the\norbital elements of an eccentric binary through the direct three-body\nintegration of a massive particle ejected through the inner Lagrangian point of\nthe donor star at periastron. The trajectory of this particle leads to three\npossible outcomes: direct accretion (DA) onto the companion star within a\nsingle orbit, self-accretion (SA) back onto the donor star within a single\norbit, or a quasi-periodic orbit around the companion star. We calculate the\nsecular evolution of the binary orbit in the first two cases and conclude that\nDA can increase or decrease the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, while\nSA always decreases the orbital both orbital elements. In cases where mass\noverflow contributes to circularizing the orbit, circularization can set in on\ntimescales as short as a few per cent of the mass transfer timescale. In cases\nwhere mass overflow increases the eccentricity, the orbital evolution is\ngoverned by competition between mass overflow and tidal torques. In the absence\nof tidal torques, mass overflow resulting in DI can lead to substantially\nsubsynchronously rotating donor stars. Contrary to common assumptions, DI\nfurthermore does not always provide a strong sink of orbital angular momentum\nin close mass-transferring binaries; in fact we instead find that a significant\npart can be returned to the orbit during the particle orbit.

Similarly, the mass function is a single power\nlaw dN/dM propto M^beta with beta=-2.10+/-0.20 for clusters with ages t<3x10^8\nyr, corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 Msun,\ndepending on the age range of the subsample.

The luminosity\nfunction for intermediate-age clusters (i.e., ~100-300 Myr old objects found in\nthe loops, tails, and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to Mv~-6,\nconsistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models which predict the\nturnover should not be observed until Mv~-4.

To test this ice\nformation scenario we mapped the B1-b dust core and nearby protostar in CH3OH\ngas using the IRAM 30m telescope to identify locations of efficient non-thermal\nice desorption. We find three CH3OH abundance peaks tracing two outflows and a\nquiescent region on the side of the core facing the protostar. The CH3OH gas\nhas a rotational temperature of ~10 K at all locations.

We prove the following direct product\ntheorem (DPT) for query complexity: if every T-query algorithm has success\nprobability at most 1 - eps in computing the Boolean function f on input\ndistribution Mu, then for alpha <= 1, every (alpha eps Tk)-query algorithm has\nsuccess probability at most (2^{alpha eps}(1 - eps))^k in computing the k-fold\ndirect product f^k correctly on k independent inputs from Mu. In light of\nexamples due to Shaltiel, this statement gives an essentially optimal tradeoff\nbetween the query bound and the error probability. As a corollary, we show that\nfor an absolute constant alpha > 0, the worst-case success probability of any\n(alpha R_2(f)k)-query randomized algorithm for f^k falls exponentially with k.\nThe best previous statement of this type, due to Klauck, Spalek, and de Wolf,\nrequired a query bound of O(bs(f)k).

Our method is quite general and yields a new XOR lemma and threshold DPT\nfor the query model, as well as DPTs for the query complexity of learning\ntasks, search problems, and tasks involving interaction with dyamic entities.\nWe also give a version of our DPT in which decision tree size is the resource\nof interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2010 22:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 12:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-12"}

One such system is the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas on a\nring. In this system binary contact interactions between the constituent\nbosonic atoms, usually alkali metals, can be controlled in both sign and\nmagnitude; a recent experiment has tuned interactions over seven orders of\nmagnitude, using an atom-molecule resonance called a Feshbach resonance. Thus\none can directly realize the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian, from the weakly- to the\nstrongly-interacting regime. At the same time there are a number of experiments\nutilizing ring traps. The ring geometry affords us the opportunity to study\ntopological properties of this system as well; one of the main properties of a\nsuperfluid is the quantized circulation in which the average angular momentum\nper particle, L/N, is quantized under rotation. Thus we focus on a tunable 1D\nBose system for which the main control parameters are interaction and rotation.\nWe will show that there is a critical boundary in the interaction-rotation\ncontrol-parameter plane over which the topological properties of the system\nchange. This is the basis of our concept of \\textit{metastable quantum phase\ntransitions} (QPTs). Moreover, we will show that the finite domain of the ring\nis necessary for the QPT to occur at all because the zero-point kinetic\npressure can induce QPTs, i.e., the system must be finite; we thus seek to\ngeneralize the concept of QPTs to inherently finite, mesoscopic or nanoscopic\nsystems.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 01:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 00:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Like the B-treap, the\nB-skip-list may be used to construct strongly history-independent index\nstructures and filesystems; such constructions reveal no information about the\nhistorical sequence of operations that led to the current logical state. For\nexample, a uniquely represented filesystem would support the deletion of a file\nin a way that, in a strong information-theoretic sense, provably removes all\nevidence that the file ever existed. Like the B-tree, the B-skip-list has depth\nO(log_B (n)) where B is the block transfer size of the external memory, uses\nlinear space with high probability, and supports efficient one-dimensional\nrange queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 01:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We start by reviewing many of\nthe assumptions underlying the concepts of real, physical, rigid bodies and the\ntranslational and rotational properties of such rigid bodies. Nearly all\nelementary and advanced texts make physical assumptions that are subtly\ndifferent from ours, and as a result we develop a mathematical description that\nis subtly different from the standard mathematical structure. Using the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of space, we investigate the translational and\nrotational features of rigid bodies in two and three dimensions. We find that\nthe concept of rigid bodies and the concept of the homogeneity of space are\nintrinsically linked. The geometric study of rotations of rigid objects leads\nto a geometric product relationship for lines and vectors. By requiring this\nproduct to be both associative and to satisfy Pythagoras' theorem, we obtain a\nchoice of Clifford algebras. We extend our arguments from space to include\ntime. By assuming that ct=l and rewriting this in Lorentz invariant form as\nc^2t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2=0 we obtain a generalization of Pythagoras to spacetime.\nThis leads us directly to establishing that the Clifford algebra CL(1,3) is an\nappropriate mathematical structure to describe spacetime. Clifford algebras are\nnot division algebras. We show that the existence of non-invertible elements in\nthe algebra is not a limitation of the usefulness to physics of the algebra but\nrather that it reflects accurately the spacetime properties of physical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 04:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-06"}

Surveys such as\nPan-STARRS and LSST should be able to detect more than ten events per year,\nwith typical event durations of around one month. Since microlensing of quasar\nsources suffers from fewer degeneracies than lensing of Milky Way sources, they\ncould be used as a powerful tool for recovering the mass of the lensing object\nin a robust, often model-independent, manner. As a consequence, for a subset of\nthese events it will be possible to directly `weigh' the star (or stellar\nremnant) that is causing the lensing signal, either through higher order\nmicrolensing effects and/or high-precision astrometric observations of the lens\nstar (using, for example, Gaia or SIM-lite).

The first problem concerns whether overloaded error free codes exist\nin the absence of additive noise under these general settings, and if so\nwhether there are any practical optimum decoding algorithms. The second one is\nabout the bounds for the sum channel capacity when user data and signature\ncodes employ any real or complex alphabets (finite or infinite). In response to\nthe first problem, we have developed practical Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding\nalgorithms for overloaded CDMA systems for a large class of alphabets.

A narrow jet from the northern source L1448C(N) was observed in\nthe SiO and the high-velocity CO. The jet consists of a chain of emission knots\nwith an inter-knot spacing of ~2\" (500 AU) and a semi-periodic velocity\nvariation. The innermost pair of knots, which are significant in the SiO map\nbut barely seen in the CO, are located at ~1\" (250 AU) from the central source,\nL1448C(N). Since the dynamical time scale for the innermost pair is only ~10\nyr, SiO may have been formed in the protostellar wind through the gas-phase\nreaction, or been formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gas\nphase by means of shocks. It is found that the jet is extremely active with a\nmechanical luminosity of ~7 L_sun, which is comparable to the bolometric\nluminosity of the central source (7.5 L_sun). The mass accretion rate onto the\nprotostar derived from the mass-loss rate is ~10^{-5} M_sun/yr. Such a high\nmass accretion rate suggests that the mass and the age of the central star are\n0.03-0.09 M_sun and (4-12)x10^3 yr, respectively, implying that the central\nstar is in the very early stage of protostellar evolution. The low-velocity CO\nemission delineates two V-shaped shells with a common apex at L1448C(N). The\nkinematics of these shells are reproduced by the model of a wide opening angle\nwind. The co-existence of the highly-collimated jets and the wide-opening angle\nshells can be explained by the unified X-wind model\" in which highly-collimated\njet components correspond to the on-axis density enhancement of the\nwide-opening angle wind.

The\nscale, resource limitations, and new threats such as node capture necessitate\nthe use of an on-line key generation by the nodes themselves. However, the cost\nof such schemes is high since their secrecy is based on computational\ncomplexity. Recently, several research contributions justified that the\nwireless channel itself can be used to generate information-theoretic secure\nkeys. By exchanging sampling messages during movement, a bit string can be\nderived that is only known to the involved entities. Yet, movement is not the\nonly possibility to generate randomness. The channel response is also strongly\ndependent on the frequency of the transmitted signal. In our work, we introduce\na protocol for key generation based on the frequency-selectivity of channel\nfading. The practical advantage of this approach is that we do not require node\nmovement. Thus, the frequent case of a sensor network with static motes is\nsupported. Furthermore, the error correction property of the protocol mitigates\nthe effects of measurement errors and other temporal effects, giving rise to an\nagreement rate of over 97%. We show the applicability of our protocol by\nimplementing it on MICAz motes, and evaluate its robustness and secrecy through\nexperiments and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 10:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-23"}

The\nprofiles of spatial curvature follow similar patterns as those of the density,\nwith 'clump to void' inversions only possible for hyperbolic models or regions.\nHowever, profiles of the expansion scalar are less restrictive, with profile\ninversions necessarily taking place in elliptic models.

It is governed by a fascinating\ninterplay of interfacial, viscous drag as well as gravitational forces which\nliquids encounter upon invasion into geometries with often complex topologies,\nsuch as capillary networks of trees or interconnected fractures in soils and\nice. Here, we present fundamentals, concepts and an experimental, gravimetric\nstudy on the capillarity-driven invasion dynamics of liquids in networks of\npores a few nanometers across in monolithic, nanoporous silica glass (porous\nVycor). A variation of the complexity of the building blocks of the liquids\ninvestigated along with a variation of the humidity and the temperature upon\nspontaneous imbibition allows us to gain information regarding the fluidity and\ncapillarity of liquids in such nanoporous environments. We observe square-root\nof time imbibition dynamics for all liquids applied, which we can\nquantitatively describe by both a conserved bulk fluidity in the pore center\nand bulk capillarity at the advancing menisci, if we assume a sticky boundary\nlayer (negative velocity slip length). Moreover, pecularities of\nnanopore-confined liquids, such as transport via the vapor phase leading to\npreadsorbed liquid layers, have to be properly accounted for. Upon increasing\nthe chain-length in the case of the n-alkanes, we found hints towards a\ntransition from stick- to slip-flow at the pore walls with increasing\nchain-length and thus polymeric behavior.

However, many models also\npredict a very high energy (VHE) emission (above hundreds of GeV) when the\nsource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. Therefore,\ndetecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. The\nimaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope MAGIC observed Cygnus X-3 for about 70\nhours between 2006 March and 2009 August in different X-ray/radio spectral\nstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. MAGIC found no\nevidence for a VHE signal from the direction of the microquasar. An upper limit\nto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 GeV has been set to 2.2 x\n10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). This is the best limit so far to\nthe VHE emission from this source. The non-detection of a VHE signal during the\nperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of the\npossible VHE radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of the\njets, where absorption is significant. The current and future generations of\nCherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 12:55:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2010 10:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

We wrote a modeling procedure to generate\nhypothetical companions of given mass, age, eccentricity, and semi-major axis,\nand place them around BPMG members that fall within the V-band range of the\nGPI.

The fraction of companions that could be detected\ndepends on their brightness at 12 Myr, and hence formation mechanism, and on\ntheir distribution of semi-major axes.

In the\nscheme of the dynamic van der Waals theory, the hydrodynamic equations\ncontaining the gradient stress are solved in the axisymmetric geometry. We\nassume that the substrate has a finite thickness and its temperature obeys the\nthermal diffusion equation. A precursor film then spreads ahead of the bulk\ndroplet itself in the complete wetting condition. Cooling the substrate\nenhances condensation of gas onto the advancing film, which mostly takes place\nnear the film edge and can be the dominant mechanism of the film growth in a\nlate stage. The generated latent heat produces a temperature peak or a hot spot\nin the gas region near the film edge. On the other hand, heating the substrate\ninduces evaporation all over the interface. For weak heating, a steady-state\ncircular thin film can be formed on the substrate. For stronger heating,\nevaporation dominates over condensation, leading to eventual disappearance of\nthe liquid region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 02:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
