We show, using the Gauss's method to sum an\narithmetic sequence, how we can construct the superposition of waves - with\ndifferent frequencies - in a simple conceptual way that it is easy to teach. By\nthis method we arrive to the usual result where we can express the\nsuperposition of waves as the product of factors, one of them with a cosine\nfuntion where the argument is the average frequency. Most important, we will\nshow that the superposition of waves with sligthly different frequencies\nproduces a \\emph{phase modulation} thogether with an amplitude moldulation.

In general, it is not possible to find the fixation\nprobability analytically given the mutant's fitness and the topological\nconstraints that govern the spread of the mutation, so one resorts to\nsimulations instead. Depending on the topology in use, a great number of\nevolutionary steps may be needed in each of the simulation events, particularly\nin those that end with the population containing mutants only. We introduce two\ntechniques to accelerate the determination of the fixation probability. The\nfirst one skips all evolutionary steps in which the number of mutants does not\nchange and thereby reduces the number of steps per simulation event\nconsiderably. This technique is computationally advantageous for some of the\nso-called layered networks. The second technique, which is not restricted to\nlayered networks, consists of aborting any simulation event in which the number\nof mutants has grown beyond a certain threshold value, and counting that event\nas having led to a total spread of the mutation. For large populations, and\nregardless of the network's topology, we demonstrate, both analytically and by\nmeans of simulations, that using a threshold of about 100 mutants leads to an\nestimate of the fixation probability that deviates in no significant way from\nthat obtained from the full-fledged simulations.

Starting in November, 2009 intensive multifrequency campaigns\nmonitored the 3C 454 gamma-ray outburst.

We detected a long-term active emission phase lasting ~1 month at all\nwavelengths: in the gamma-ray band, peak emission was reached on December 2-3,\n2009. Remarkably, this gamma-ray super-flare was not accompanied by\ncorrespondingly intense emission in the optical/UV band that reached a level\nsubstantially lower than the previous observations in 2007-2008. The lack of\nstrong simultaneous optical brightening during the super-flare and the\ndetermination of the broad-band spectral evolution severely constrain the\ntheoretical modelling. We find that the pre- and post-flare broad-band behavior\ncan be explained by a one-zone model involving SSC plus external Compton\nemission from an accretion disk and a broad-line region. However, the spectra\nof the Dec. 2-3, 2009 super-flare and of the secondary peak emission on Dec. 9,\n2009 cannot be satisfactorily modelled by a simple one-zone model.

In the poloidal plane, we also discuss shapes of\nthe related effective potential halo lobes where the general off-equatorial\nmotion can be bound. Then we focus on the halo orbits near a Kerr black hole\nimmersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field of external origin. We\ndemonstrate that, in both the cases considered, the lobes exhibit two different\nregimes, namely, one where completely disjoint lobes occur symmetrically above\nand below the equatorial plane, and another where the lobes are joined across\nthe plane.

However, the\nphysical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain\npoorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of\nmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive\nstar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,\ncloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing\nradiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show\nfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion\nflows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these\nflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive\nstar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.\nThis explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order\nstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of\nall masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead\nto a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would\nform without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation\nbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.\nIt predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of\ncollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar\nmechanism will act during primordial star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 17:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2010 16:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-18"}

As it is well known\nthis class of Bianchi IX models are homogeneous and anisotropic with two scale\nfactors, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, derived from the solution of Einstein's equation\nfor General Relativity. The model we use in this work has a cosmological\nconstant and the matter content is dust. To this model we add a\nquantum-inspired potential that is intended to represent short-range effects\ndue to the general relativistic behavior of matter in small scales and play the\nrole of a repulsive force near the singularity. We find that this potential\nrestricts the dynamics of the model to positive values of $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ and\nalters some qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the dynamics\nstudied previously by several authors.

With the contributions of Xi Boo A and\nB to the system's total X-ray emission now observationally established (88.5%\nand 11.5%, respectively), consideration of mass loss measurements for GK dwarfs\nof various activity levels (including one for Xi Boo) leads to the surprising\nconclusion that Xi Boo B may dominate the wind from the binary, with Xi Boo A's\nwind being very weak despite its active corona. Emission measure distributions\nand coronal abundances are computed for both stars and compared with Chandra\nmeasurements of other moderately active stars with G8-K5 spectral types, all of\nwhich exhibit a narrow peak in emission measure near log T=6.6, indicating that\nthe coronal heating process in these stars has a strong preference for this\ntemperature. As is the case for the Sun and many other stars, our sample of\nstars shows coronal abundance anomalies dependent on the first ionization\npotential (FIP) of the element.

Signatures of mergers have\nbeen previously found in these clusters, both in X-rays and at\nopticalwavelengths, thus motivating our study. In X-rays, they are relatively\nbright, and Abell 223 shows a double structure. A filament has also been\ndetected between the clusters both at optical and X-ray wavelengths. We analyse\nthe optical properties of these two clusters based on deep imaging in two\nbands, derive their galaxy minosity functions (GLFs) and correlate these\nproperties with X-ray characteristics derived from XMM-Newton data. The GLFs of\nAbell 222 in the g' and r' bands are well fit by a Schechter function; the GLF\nis steeper in r' than in g'. For Abell 223, the GLFs in both bands require a\nsecond component at bright magnitudes, added to a Schechter function; they are\nsimilar in both bands. The Serna & Gerbal method allows to separate well the\ntwo clusters. No obvious filamentary structures are detected at very large\nscales around the clusters, but a third cluster at the same redshift, Abell\n209, is located at a projected distance of 19.2 Mpc. X-ray temperature and\nmetallicity maps reveal that the temperature and metallicity of the X-ray gas\nare quite homogeneous in Abell 222, while they are very perturbed in Abell 223.\nThe Abell 222/Abell 223 system is complex. The two clusters that form this\nstructure present very different dynamical states. Signs of recent interactions\nare also detected in the optical data where this cluster shows a ``perturbed''\nGLF.

An\nanalytical formula for the dominant mode of the gravitational radiation of\nnon-precessing black hole binaries is presented that captures the phenomenology\nof the hybrid waveforms. Its implementation in the current searches for\ngravitational waves should allow cross-checks of other inspiral-merger-ringdown\nwaveform families and improve the reach of gravitational wave searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2010 12:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 11:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Here we propose a test of this effect through coincident\nobservations of gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts from binary\nmergers involving neutron stars. Such gravitational waves are highly left or\nright circularly-polarized due to the geometry of the merger.

We use this new photometric dataset to\nreevaluate the properties (age and distance) of IC4665. Namely, using a\nstatistical approach incorporating Tau^2 CMD modeling, we measure a\npre-main-sequence isochrone age and distance of 36+-9 Myr and 360+-12 pc, as\nwell as a upper-main-sequence turn-off age and distance of 42+-12 Myr and\n357+-12 pc. These ages and distances are highly dependent on the isochrone\nmodel and color used for the fitting procedure, with a possible range of ~10-20\nMyr in age and ~20 pc in distance. This spread in calculated ages and distances\nseen between colors and models is likely due to limitations in the individual\nmembership catalogs and/or systematic differences in the predicted stellar\nparameters from the different sets of models. Interestingly, when we compare\nthe isochrone ages for IC4665 to the published lithium depletion boundary age,\n28+-5 Myr, we observe that this cluster does not appear to follow the trend of\nisochrone ages being 1.5 times smaller than lithium depletion boundary ages. In\naddition, comparing the overall magnetic activity (X-ray and H-alpha emission)\nin IC4665 with other well studied open clusters, we find the observed activity\ndistributions for this young cluster are best characterized by assuming an age\nof 30-40 Myr, thus in agreement with our pre-main-sequence and turn-off\nisochrone ages for IC4665. Overall, although some age discrepancies do exist,\nparticularly in the ages measured from pre-main-sequence isochrones, the range\nof possible IC4665 ages derived from the various dating techniques employed\nhere is relatively small compared to that found for other well studied open\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 21:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Though all\nor nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%\nwere detected in the EGS X-ray survey (AEGIS-X) using 200 ks Chandra\nobservations.

Stacking the\nX-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant X-ray\nsignal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured than\nsources with X-ray detections. The ratio of X-ray to mid-infrared fluxes\nsuggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in X-rays are\nobscured at the Compton-thick level, in contrast to the X-ray-detected sources,\nall of which appear to be Compton-thin. For the X-ray-detected power-law\nsources with redshifts, an X-ray luminosity L_X ~ 10^44 erg/s marks a\ntransition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy to\nhigh-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.\nX-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of the\nsample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources as\nactive nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of AGNs are selected by\nthe power law criteria.

We\nplot the new phase diagram which can be used, together with the information\nabout the anomalous dimension, to propose ideal models of walking technicolor.\nWe discover that when the extended technicolor sector, responsible for giving\nmasses to the standard model fermions, is sufficiently strongly coupled the\ntechnicolor theory, in isolation, must have an infrared fixed point for the\nfull model to be phenomenologically viable. Using the new phase diagram we show\nthat the simplest one family and minimal walking technicolor models are the\narchetypes of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. Our\npredictions can be verified via first principle lattice simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2010 22:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-28"}

Developments in these fields\nnormally assume these resources stable and not susceptible of distortion. That\nis not always the case, Heisenberg interactions between qubits can produce\ndistortion on entangled pairs generated for engineering purposes (e. g. for\nquantum computation or quantum cryptography). Experimental work shows how to\nproduce entangled spin qubits in quantum dots and electron gases, so its\nidentification and control are crucial for later applications. The presence of\nparasite magnetic fields modifies the expected properties and behavior for\nwhich the pair was intended. Quantum measurement and control help to\ndiscriminate the original state in order to correct it or, just to try of\nreconstruct it using some procedures which do not alter their quantum nature.\n  Two different kinds of quantum entangled pairs driven by a Heisenberg\nHamiltonian with an additional inhomogeneous magnetic field which becoming\nself-distorted, can be reconstructed without previous discrimination by adding\nan external magnetic field, with fidelity close to 1 (with respect to the\noriginal state, but without discrimination). After, each state can be more\nefficiently discriminated. The aim of this work is to show how combining both\nprocesses, first reconstruction without discrimination and after discrimination\nwith adequate non-local measurements, it's possible a) improve the\ndiscrimination, and b) reprepare faithfully the original states. The complete\nprocess gives fidelities better than 0.9. In the meanwhile, some results about\na class of equivalence for the required measurements were found. This property\nlets us select the adequate measurement in order to ease the repreparation\nafter of discrimination, without loss of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 00:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

Superconductors exhibit non-zero electrical resistance under\ncircumstances where phase slips occur at a finite rate. For one-dimensional\nsuperconductors or Josephson junctions, phase slips can occur at isolated\npoints in space-time. Phase slip rates may be controlled by thermal activation\nover a free-energy barrier, or in some circumstances, at low temperatures, by\nquantum tunneling through a barrier.

The PWN embedded in the SNR is powered by an energetic\npulsar PSR J1813-1749, which was recently discovered. Whether the TeV\ngamma-rays originate from the SNR shell or the PWN is uncertain now. We\ninvestigate theoretically the multiwavelength nonthermal radiation from the\ncomposite SNR G12.8-0.0. The emission from the particles accelerated in the SNR\nshell is calculated based on a semianalytical method to the nonlinear diffusive\nshock acceleration mechanism. In the model, the magnetic field is\nself-generated via resonant streaming instability, and the dynamical reaction\nof the field on the shock is taken into account. Based on a model which couples\nthe dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN in a non-radiative SNR, the\ndynamics and the multi-band emission of the PWN are investigated. The particles\nare injected with a spectrum of a relativistic Maxwellian plus a power law\nhigh-energy tail with an index of -2.5. Our results indicate that the radio\nemission from the shell can be well reproduced as synchrotron radiation of the\nelectrons accelerated by the SNR shock; with an ISM number density of 1.4\ncm^{-3} for the remnant, the gamma-ray emission from the SNR shell is\ninsignificant, and the observed X-rays and VHE gamma-rays from the source are\nconsistent with the emission produced by electrons/positrons injected in the\nPWN via synchrotron radiation and IC scattering, respectively; the resulting\ngamma-ray flux for the shell is comparable to the detected one only with a\nrelatively larger density of about 2.8 cm^{-3}. The VHE gamma-rays of HESS\nJ1813-178 can be naturally explained to mainly originate from the nebula\nalthough the contribution of the SNR shell becomes significant with a denser\nambient medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 09:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2010 02:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A possible resolution was\nsuggested by Quevedo et al. who emphasized the importance of Legendre\ninvariance in thermodynamic metrics. They found physically consistent results\nfor various black holes when using a Legendre invariant metric, which agreed\nwith a direct determination of the properties of phase transitions from the\nspecific heat.\n  Recently, information geometric methods have been employed by Wei et al. to\nstudy the Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS) black hole in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The\nformalism suggests that a coupling parameter in this theory plays a role\nanalogous to the charge in Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black holes or angular\nmomentum in the Kerr black hole and calculation of the specific heat shows a\nsingularity which may be interpreted as a phase transition.

A rapid expansion is required to form\na magnetic canopy. Aims: We characterize the observed expansion properties of\nmagnetic network elements and compare them with the thin flux tube and sheet\napproximations, as well as with magnetoconvection simulations. Methods: We used\ndata from the Hinode SOT NFI NaD1 channel and spectropolarimeter to study the\nappearance of magnetic flux concentrations seen in circular polarization as a\nfunction of position on the solar disk. We compared the observations with\nsynthetic observables from models based on the thin flux tube approximation and\nmagnetoconvection simulations with two different upper boundary conditions for\nthe magnetic field (potential and vertical). Results: The observed circular\npolarization signal of magnetic flux concentrations changes from unipolar at\ndisk center to bipolar near the limb, which implies an expanding magnetic\nfield. The observed expansion agrees with expansion properties derived from the\nthin flux sheet and tube approximations. Magnetoconvection simulations with a\npotential field as the upper boundary condition for the magnetic field also\nproduce bipolar features near the limb while a simulation with a vertical field\nboundary condition does not. Conclusions: The near-limb apparent bipolar\nmagnetic features seen in high-resolution Hinode observations can be\ninterpreted using a simple flux sheet or tube model. This lends further support\nto the idea that magnetic features with vastly varying sizes have similar\nrelative expansion rates. The numerical simulations presented here are less\nuseful in interpreting the expansion since the diagnostics we are interested in\nare strongly influenced by the choice of the upper boundary condition for the\nmagnetic field in the purely photospheric simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Sun,\nGalaxy (and Jupiter) gravitationally act on the comets. New physical model of\ngalactic tide is considered. The main results can be summarized as follows:\n  1. Mass of the Oort cloud of comets is less than 1 mass of the Earth\n($M_{E}$), probably not greater than 1/2 $M_{E}$.\n  2. Theoretical number of long-period comets with perihelion distance $q$ $<$\n5 AU is about 50-times greater than the conventional approach yields. Gravity\nof Jupiter was taken into account in finding this result.\n  3. Semi-major axis $a$ and period of oscillations $P$ of eccentricity (and\nother orbital elements) are related as $a^{3}$ $P$ $=$ 1 in natural units for a\nmoving Solar System in the Galaxy. The natural unit for time is the orbital\nperiod of the Solar System revolution around the galactic center and the\nnatural unit for measuring the semi-major axis is its maximum value for the\nhalf-radius of the Solar System corresponding to the half-radius of the Oort\ncloud. The relation holds for the cases when comets approach the inner part of\nthe Solar System, e.g., perihelion distances are less than $\\approx$ 100 AU.\n  4. The minimum value of semi-major axis for the Oort cloud is $a_{min}$ $\\ll$\n1 $\\times$ 10$^{4}$ AU.

We therefore investigate magnetic helicity injection\nrate and unsigned magnetic flux, as a reference. In total, 378 active regions\nare analyzed using $SOHO$/MDI magnetograms. The 24-hour averaged helicity\ninjection rate and unsigned magnetic flux are compared with the flare index and\nthe flare-productive probability in next 24 hours following an measurement. In\naddition, we study the variation of helicity over a span of several days around\nthe times of the 19 flares above M5.0 which occurred in selected strong\nflare-productive active regions. The major findings of this study are: (1) for\na sub-sample of 91 large active regions with unsigned magnetic fluxes in the\nrange from 3 to 5 $\\times$ 10$^{22}$ Mx, there is a difference in magnetic\nhelicity injection rate between flaring active regions and non-flaring active\nregions by a factor of 2; (2) the $GOES$ C-flare-productive probability as a\nfunction of helicity injection displays a sharp boundary between\nflare-productive active regions and flare-quiet ones; (3) the history of\nhelicity injection before all the 19 major flares displayed a common\ncharacteristic: a significant helicity accumulation of (3-45)$ \\times$ 10\n$^{42}$ Mx$^2$ during a phase of monotonically increasing helicity over 0.5 to\n2 days.

Although\nthe ambition of luminosity is not pursued, such energies by themselves may\nallow us to begin to feel and study the physics of the 'texture of vacuum'.\nThis is an example of fundamental physics exploration without the need of\nluminosity paradigm. By converting accelerated electrons with extreme energies\nto like energy gamma photons, and let them propagate through vacuum over a\nsufficient distance, these extremely high energy (and therefore short\nwavelength) photons experience smallest vacuum structures and fluctuations.

We\nfind that the interaction is consistent and does not lead to superluminal\npropagation for a range of the mass parameter where the spin 1/2 component is\nlighter than the spin 3/2 component, in contrast to the traditional value\nwhereby the spin 1/2 component is removed by making it infinitely massive.

Following this serendipitous discovery,\nthe EXOTIME (http://www.na.astro.it/~silvotti/exotime/) monitoring program has\nbeen set up to follow the pulsations of a number of selected rapidly pulsating\nsubdwarf B stars on time-scales of several years with two immediate\nobservational goals:\n  1) determine Pdot of the pulsational periods P\n  2) search for signatures of substellar companions in O-C residuals due to\nperiodic light travel time variations, which would be tracking the central\nstar's companion-induced wobble around the center of mass.\n  These sets of data should therefore at the same time: on the one hand be\nuseful to provide extra constraints for classical asteroseismological exercises\nfrom the Pdot (comparison with \"local\" evolutionary models), and on the other\nhand allow to investigate the preceding evolution of a target in terms of\npossible \"binary\" evolution by extending the otherwise unsuccessful search for\ncompanions to potentially very low masses. While timing pulsations may be an\nobservationally expensive method to search for companions, it samples a\ndifferent range of orbital parameters, inaccessible through orbital photometric\neffects or the radial velocity method: the latter favours massive close-in\ncompanions, whereas the timing method becomes increasingly more sensitive\ntowards wider separations.

The star formation law in near-by galaxies, as measured\non sub-kiloparsec scales, has recently been shown by Bigiel et al. to be\ndistinctly non-linear in its dependence on total gas density. Our\nparameterization of the spatially resolved Schmidt-Sanduleak relation naturally\naccommodates that dependence. The parameterized form of the relation is rho_* ~\nepsilon x rho_g/(tau_s + rho_g ^{-n}), where rho_g is the gas density, epsilon\nis the efficiency of converting gas into stars, and rho_g^{-n} captures the\nphysics of cloud collapse. Accordingly at high gas densities quiescent star\nformation is predicted to progress as rho_* ~ rho_g, while at low gas densities\nrho_* ~ rho_g^{1+n}, as is now generally observed. A variable efficiency in\nlocally converting gas into stars as well as the unknown plane thickness\nvariations from galaxy to galaxy, and radially within a given galaxy, can\nreadily account for the empirical scatter in the observed (surface density\nrather than volume density) relations, and also plausibly account for the noted\nupturn in the relation at very high apparent projected column densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 14:53:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2010 18:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that in non-monotonic epidemics, public\nhealth officials might be able to intervene in a fundamentally new way to\nchange the network so as to control the effect of unexpectedly-high virulence.\nHowever, interventions that decrease transmissibility might actually cause more\npeople to become infected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2010 15:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 14:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This place was a\nsocial theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place:\ninterpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and\nglobal collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we\nfocus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative\nemergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent\nself-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined\nenvironment and under a common fate, collective structures appear\nspontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues,\ncurls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant\nfeatures to enhance the realism - more precisely the \"truthfulness\" - of models\nof this kind of collective phenomena. We assume that this truthfulness is\nstrongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not\npredetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of\nnumerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis\nof small changes. This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting\nparticles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it\nassociates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary\nnon-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a\nlarge, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata.
