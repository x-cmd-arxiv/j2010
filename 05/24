This, combined with mutual coupling between antennas, makes it\ndifficult to predict the sensitivity of these instruments. This paper describes\na system model and procedure for estimating the system equivalent flux density\n(SEFD) - a useful and meaningful metric of the sensitivity of a radio telescope\n- that accounts for these issues. The method is applied to LWA-1, the first\n\"station\" of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) interferometer. LWA-1 consists of\n512 bowtie-type antennas within a 110 x 100 m elliptical footprint, and is\ndesigned to operate between 10 MHz and 88 MHz using receivers having noise\ntemperature of about 250 K.

It is also shown that considerable improvement is\npossible using beamforming coefficients which are designed to optimize\nsignal-to-noise ratio under these conditions. Mutual coupling is found to play\na significant role, but does not have a consistently positive or negative\ninfluence. In particular, we demonstrate that pattern multiplication (assuming\nthe behavior of single antennas embedded in the array is the same as those same\nantennas by themselves) does not generate reliable estimates of SEFD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 May 2010 20:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

With this outlook in mind,\nthis paper presents a hybrid Godunov method for one-dimensional radiation\nhydrodynamics that is uniformly well behaved from the photon free streaming\n(hyperbolic) limit through the weak equilibrium diffusion (parabolic) limit and\nto the strong equilibrium diffusion (hyperbolic) limit. Moreover, one finds\nthat the technique preserves certain asymptotic limits. The method incorporates\na backward Euler upwinding scheme for the radiation energy density and flux as\nwell as a modified Godunov scheme for the material density, momentum density,\nand energy density. The backward Euler upwinding scheme is first-order accurate\nand uses an implicit HLLE flux function to temporally advance the radiation\ncomponents according to the material flow scale. The modified Godunov scheme is\nsecond-order accurate and directly couples stiff source term effects to the\nhyperbolic structure of the system of balance laws. This Godunov technique is\ncomposed of a predictor step that is based on Duhamel's principle and a\ncorrector step that is based on Picard iteration. The Godunov scheme is\nexplicit on the material flow scale but is unsplit and fully couples matter and\nradiation without invoking a diffusion-type approximation for radiation\nhydrodynamics. This technique derives from earlier work by Miniati & Colella\n2007. Numerical tests demonstrate that the method is stable, robust, and\naccurate across various parameter regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 03:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These systems are based on an\nintercellular feedback loop in which Notch activation leads to down-regulation\nof Delta. However, even in relatively well-characterized systems, the pathway\nleading from Notch activation to Delta repression often remains elusive. Recent\nwork has shown that cis-interactions between Notch and Delta lead to mutual\ninactivation of both proteins. Here we show that this type of cis-interaction\nenables a simpler and more direct mechanism for lateral inhibition feedback\nthan those proposed previously. In this mechanism, Notch signaling directly\nup-regulates Notch expression, thereby inactivating Delta through the mutual\ninactivation of Notch and Delta proteins. This mechanism, which we term\nSimplest Lateral Inhibition by Mutual Inactivation (SLIMI), can implement\npatterning without requiring any additional genes or regulatory interactions.\nMoreover, the key interaction of Notch expression in response to Notch\nsignaling has been observed in some systems. Stability analysis and simulation\nof SLIMI mathematical models show that this lateral inhibition circuit is\ncapable of pattern formation across a broad range of parameter values.

In this paper, we construct a rigorous measurement-theoretic\nframework for the description of particle oscillations, employing no\nassumptions extrinsic to quantum theory. The formalism leads to a non-standard\noscillation formula; at low energy it predicts an `anomalous' oscillation\nwavelength, while at high energy it differs from the standard expression by a\nfactor of 2. The key novelties in the formalism are the treatment of a\nparticle's time of arrival at the detector as a genuine quantum observable, the\ntheoretical precision in the definition of quantum probabilities, and the\ndetailed modeling of the measurement process.

Of primary importance in our study are the\nnonlinear normal modes (NNMs), i.e periodic solutions which represent\ncontinuations of the system's linear normal modes in the nonlinear regime. We\nexamine the existence of such solutions and discuss different methods for\nconstructing them and studying their stability under fixed and periodic\nboundary conditions. In the periodic case, we employ group theoretical concepts\nto identify a special type of NNMs called one-dimensional \"bushes\". We describe\nhow to use linear combinations such NNMs to construct s(>1)-dimensional bushes\nof quasiperiodic orbits, for a wide variety of Hamiltonian systems and exploit\nthe symmetries of the linearized equations to simplify the study of their\ndestabilization. Applying this theory to the Fermi Pasta Ulam (FPU) chain, we\nreview a number of interesting results, which have appeared in the recent\nliterature. We then turn to an analytical and numerical construction of\nquasiperiodic orbits, which does not depend on the symmetries or boundary\nconditions.

In agreement with Oikonomou and Cluzel (2006)\nwe find that networks with SFin topologies, that is SF topology for incoming\nnodes and ER topology for outgoing nodes, are significantly more evolvable\ntowards specific oscillatory targets than networks with ER topology for both\nincoming and outgoing nodes. Similar results are found for networks with SFboth\nand SFout topologies. The functionality of the SFout topology, which most\nclosely resembles the structure of biological gene networks (Babu et al.,\n2004), is compared to the ER topology in further detail through an extension to\nmultiple target outputs, with either an oscillatory or a non-oscillatory\nnature. For multiple oscillatory targets of the same length, the differences\nbetween SFout and ER networks are enhanced, but for non-oscillatory targets\nboth types of networks show fairly similar evolvability. We find that SF\nnetworks generate oscillations much more easily than ER networks do, and this\nmay explain why SF networks are more evolvable than ER networks are for\noscillatory phenotypes. In spite of their greater evolvability, we find that\nnetworks with SFout topologies are also more robust to mutations than ER\nnetworks. Furthermore, the SFout topologies are more robust to changes in\ninitial conditions (environmental robustness). For both topologies, we find\nthat once a population of networks has reached the target state, further\nneutral evolution can lead to an increase in both the mutational robustness and\nthe environmental robustness to changes in initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 14:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}

The key idea of the\nprocedure can be reduced to a correct choice of the sampling sequence. This\nfreedom, owing to the arbitrary choice of the sampling instants, is used to\nimprove the sensitivity of system controllability and observability, by\nexploiting an adequate geometric structure. Some qualitative examples are\npresented for illustrative purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 15:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 07:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-14"}

TRIS and ARCADE2 are the most recent\nexperiments dedicated to the exploration of this chapter of CMB cosmology. The\nlevel of instrumental accuracy they reached in the determination of the\nabsolute sky temperature is such that the removal of galactic and\nextra-galactic contamination is the true bottleneck towards the recovery of the\ncosmological signal. This will be certainly the case also for future\nexperiments in the radio domain. Here we present an update of a study\noriginally done to recognize the contribution of unresolved extra-galactic\nradio sources to the sky brightness measured by TRIS. Despite the specific\ncontext which originated our analysis, this is a study of general interest,\nimproved by the inclusion of all the source counts available up-to-date from\n150 MHz to 8.4 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 15:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-25"}
