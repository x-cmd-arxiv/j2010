It has previously been conjectured that these should be\ndescribed by a Gaussian Random Wave Model, by analogy with quantum chaotic\nsystems, for which such a model was proposed by Berry in 1977. The\nautocorrelation functions we calculate for an individual quantum graph exhibit\na universal component, which completely determines a Gaussian Random Wave\nModel, and a system-dependent deviation. This deviation depends on the graph\nonly through its underlying classical dynamics. Classical criteria for quantum\nuniversality to be met asymptotically in the large graph limit (i.e. for the\nnon-universal deviation to vanish) are then extracted. We use an exact field\ntheoretic expression in terms of a variant of a supersymmetric sigma model. A\nsaddle-point analysis of this expression leads to the estimates. In particular,\nintensity correlations are used to discuss the possible equidistribution of the\nenergy eigenfunctions in the large graph limit. When equidistribution is\nasymptotically realized, our theory predicts a rate of convergence that is a\nsignificant refinement of previous estimates. The universal and\nsystem-dependent components of intensity correlation functions are recovered by\nmeans of an exact trace formula which we analyse in the diagonal approximation,\ndrawing in this way a parallel between the field theory and semiclassics. Our\nresults provide the first instance where an asymptotic Gaussian Random Wave\nModel has been established microscopically for eigenfunctions in a system with\nno disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 16:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The proof uses\nthe notions of absolute continuity in k dimensions and weak differentiability.\nAs examples to which this theorem applies, we spell out a number of models\nincluding a correlation model and the general multivariate location and scale\nmodel. As a consequence of this approach, we show that in the (multivariate)\nlocation scale model, finiteness of Fisher information as defined here is in\nfact equivalent to L_2-differentiability and to a log-likelihood expansion\ngiving local asymptotic normality of the model. Paralleling Huber's proofs for\nexistence and uniqueness of a minimizer of Fisher information to our situation,\nwe get existence of a minimizer in any weakly closed set of central\ndistributions F.

Particular attention will be paid to\ngeneralized Lie algebras, which are defined by even multibrackets obtained by\nantisymmetrizing the associative products of its n components and that satisfy\nthe generalized Jacobi identity (GJI), and to Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras,\nwhich are defined by fully antisymmetric n-brackets that satisfy the Filippov\nidentity (FI). Three-Lie algebras have surfaced recently in multi-brane theory\nin the context of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model. Because of this,\nFilippov algebras will be discussed at length, including the cohomology\ncomplexes that govern their central extensions and their deformations\n(Whitehead's lemma extends to all semisimple n-Lie algebras). When the\nskewsymmetry of the n-Lie algebra is relaxed, one is led the n-Leibniz\nalgebras.

Although there is a wealth of\ninformation about its dust content and composition, not much is known about its\ngas and large scale kinematics. We detect and study the molecular gas in the\ndisc at spatial resolution from 7.7\" to 18.9\" using the APEX telescope. The\nlines 12CO J=7-6, J=6-5, J=3-2, 13CO J=3-2 and [C I] 3P2-3P1 are observed,\ndiagnostic of disc temperature, size, chemistry, and kinematics. We use\nparametric disc models that reproduce the low-J 12CO emission from Herbig~Ae\nstars and vary the basic disc parameters - temperature, mass and size. Using\nthe molecular excitation and radiative transfer code RATRAN we fit the observed\nspectral line profiles. Our observations are consistent with more than 0.001\nMsun of molecular gas in a disc of approximately 400 AU radius in Keplerian\nrotation around a 2.5 Msun star, seen at an inclination of 50 degrees. The\ndetected 12CO lines are dominated by gas at 30-70~K. The non-detection of the\n[C I] line indicates excess ultraviolet emission above that of a B9 type model\nstellar atmosphere. Asymmetry in the 12CO line emission suggests that one side\nof the outer disc is colder by 10-20~K than the other, possibly due to a shadow\nby a warped geometry of the inner disc. Pointing offsets, foreground cloud\nabsorption and asymmetry in the disc extent are excluded scenarios. Efficient\nheating of the outer disc ensures that low- and high-J 12CO lines are dominated\nby the outermost disc regions, indicating a 400 AU radius. The 12CO J=6--5 line\narises from a disc layer higher above disc midplane, and warmer by 15-20~K than\nthe layer emitting the J=3--2 line.

A classical simple fluid with a locally introduced field\nsimulating a solid is considered. For the case of a hard-core field, rigid,\nexponential, realistic, and macroscopically smooth boundaries are examined.\n  Two approaches to this problem are analyzed. With some degree of\narbitrariness, they can be referred to as \"adsorption\" vs \"surface tension\" or\n\"cluster expansion\" vs \"pressure tensor\".\n  The \"adsorption\" approach is used to obtain a series in powers of the\nactivity for gamma. For Mayer-type expansion the integrals of the Ursell\nfunctions contain factors which depend on the particle/wall interaction\npotential. In the case of a hard wall, the coefficients of the series reduce to\nthe first moments of the Ursell functions taken over certain regions.\n  The \"surface tension\" approach is used to expand the Kirkwood-Buff formula\nfor gamma to the arbitrary localization of the dividing surface. \"The surface\ntension coefficient\" breaks up into the term proportional to the Henry\nconstant, depending on the dividing surface position, and universal nonlinear\nsurface coefficient.\n  It is shown that the derivative of the tangential component of the pressure\ntensor with respect to the chemical potential coincides with the near-surface\nnumber density on average over the transition region, that has two\nconsequences.\n  Firstly, it proves complete identity between \"tension\" and \"adsorption\"\napproaches in the domain of their existence.\n  Secondly, it gives the near-surface virial expansion, which determines the\nexact equation of state of near boundary \"two-dimensional\" fluid. The\ntangential component of the pressure tensor averaged over the transition region\nplays the role of pressure, and the average number density - the role of number\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 19:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 16:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2010 03:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Feb 2011 06:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2011 09:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2011 18:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-08"}

These observations demonstrated that\nshort GRBs are cosmological in origin, reside in both star forming and\nelliptical galaxies, are not associated with supernovae, and span a wide\nisotropic-equivalent energy range of ~10^48-10^52 erg. However, a fundamental\nquestion remains unanswered: What are the progenitors of short GRBs? The most\npopular theoretical model invokes the coalescence of compact object binaries\nwith neutron star and/or black hole constituents. However, additional\npossibilities exist, including magnetars formed through prompt channels\n(massive star core-collapse) and delayed channels (binary white dwarf mergers,\nwhite dwarf accretion-induced collapse), or accretion-induced collapse of\nneutron stars. In this review I summarize our current knowledge of the galactic\nand sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, and use these observations to draw\ninferences about the progenitor population. The most crucial results are: (i)\nsome short GRBs explode in dead elliptical galaxies; (ii) the majority of short\nGRBs occur in star forming galaxies; (iii) the star forming hosts of short GRBs\nare distinct from those of long GRBs (lower star formation rates, and higher\nluminosities and metallicities), and instead appear to be drawn from the\ngeneral field galaxy population; (iv) the physical offsets of short GRBs\nrelative to their host galaxy centers are significantly larger than for long\nGRBs; (v) the observed offset distribution is in good agreement with\npredictions for NS-NS binary mergers; and (vi) short GRBs trace under-luminous\nlocations within their hosts, but appear to be more closely correlated with the\nrest-frame optical light (old stars) than the UV light (young massive stars).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2011 15:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The accuracy of SFR measurements at z~2 has been questioned\nfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. The\nlatter predict SFRs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or more\nlower than the measurements. We present star-formation rates based on\ncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (FIR) luminosities for massive\n1.5<z<2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which do not depend on\nextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.\nThe measurements are based on observations in GOODS-N with the Photodetector\nArray Camera & Spectrometer (PACS) onboard Herschel, as part of the PACS\nEvolutionary Probe (PEP) project, that resolve for the first time individual\nSFGs at these redshifts at FIR wavelengths. We compare FIR-based SFRs to the\nmore commonly used 24 micron and UV SFRs. We find that SFRs from 24 micron\nalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true SFRs. This overestimation\ndepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log L(24um)>12.2 L_sun. The\nSFGs and AGNs tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. The UV SFRs are in\ncloser agreement with the FIR-based SFRs. Using a Calzetti UV extinction\ncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dex\nfrom the FIR SFRs. The previous UV SFRs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,\nwhile narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between the\nobserved SFRs and simulation predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 20:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 08:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A major issue in the\nlatter applications is the difficulty to obtain directional emission of light\nin the far-field while keeping high energy densities inside the cavity (i.e.\nhigh quality factor). To improve our understanding of these systems, we have\nstudied the annular cavity (a dielectric disk with a circular hole), where the\ndistance cavity-hole centers, d, is used as a parameter to alter the properties\nof cavity resonances. We present results showing how one can affect the\ndirectionality of the far-field while preserving the uniformity (hence the\nquality factor) of the near-field simply by increasing the value of d.\nInterestingly, the transition between a uniform near- and far-field to a\nuniform near- and directional far-field is rather abrupt. We can explain this\nbehavior quite nicely with a simple model, supported by full numerical\ncalculations, and we predict that the effect will also be found in a large\nclass of eigenmodes of the cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 21:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}

For the rate and power expected\nin star forming regions, we previously (Carroll et al. 2009) demonstrated that\noutflows could drive supersonic turbulence at levels consistent with the\nscaling relations from Matzner 2007 although with a steeper velocity power\nspectrum than expected for an isotropically driven supersonic turbulent\ncascade. Here we perform higher resolution simulations and combine simulations\nof outflow driven turbulence with those of isotropically forced turbulence. We\nfind that the presence of outflows within an ambient isotropically driven\nturbulent environment produces a knee in the velocity power spectrum at the\noutflow scale and a steeper slope at sub-outflow scales than for a purely\nisotropically forced case.

These effects are qualitatively\nindependent of resolution. We have also carried out Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) for synthetic data from our simulations.

This causal Lorentz gauge agrees with the Coulomb gauge for\nstatic charge densities, but allows the four-vector potential to have a\nlongitudinal component that is determined by the time derivative of the\nfour-vector potential's time component. Just as in Coulomb gauge, the two\ntransverse components of the four-vector potential are its sole dynamical part.\nThe four-vector potential in this gauge covariantly separates into a dynamical\ntransverse four-vector potential and a nondynamical timelike/longitudinal\nfour-vector potential, where each of these two satisfies the Lorentz condition.\nIn fact, analogous partition of the conserved four-current shows each to\nsatisfy a Lorentz-condition Maxwell equation system with its own conserved\nfour-current. Because of this complete separation, either of these four-vector\npotentials can be tinkered with without affecting its counterpart. Since it\nsatisfies the Lorentz condition, the nondynamical four-vector potential times a\nconstant with dimension of inverse length squared is itself a conserved\nfour-current, and so can be fed back into its own source current, which\ntransforms its time component into an extended Yukawa, with both exponentially\ndecaying and exponentially growing components.

Evidence of asymmetry in the optical is almost missing in the KIG\nsample and significantly more common in the KPG than in the HCG samples.

The HCG galaxies seem\nto be at a more advanced stage of interaction than the KPGs.

Continuum variations are present at all times\nand spectra can be well fit with a powerlaw component, a high kT blackbody\ncomponent, and a broad line component near oxygen. The spectra require\nadjustments to the Ne K edge and in some occasions also to the Mg K edge. The\nNe K edge appears variable in terms of optical depths and morphology. The edge\nreveals average blue- and red-shifted values implying Doppler velocities of the\norder of 3500 \\kms. The data show that Ne K exhibits excess column densities of\nup to several 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The variability proves that the excess is\nintrinsic to the source. The correponding disk velocities also imply an outer\ndisk radius of the order of $< 10^9$ cm consistent with an ultra-compact binary\nnature.

From literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified SMGs\nand nine OFRGs located in the GOODS-N and the A2218 fields. This sample is\ncross-matched with our PACS 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. About\nhalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with PACS. The dust\ntemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived by\nfitting their PACS and SCUBA 850 um (only the upper limits for the OFRGs) flux\ndensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. The median\ndust temperature of our SMG sample is T=36+/-8K while for our OFRG sample it is\nT=47+/-3K. For both samples, median dust temperatures derived from Herschel\ndata agree well with previous estimates. In particular, Chapman et al. (2005)\nfound a dust temperature of T=36+/-7K for a large sample of SMGs assuming the\nvalidity of the FIR/radio correlation. The agreement between our studies\nconfirms that the local FIR/radio correlation effectively holds at high\nredshift even though we find <q>=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than that\nobserved in local systems.

After all, non-commutative geometry does not purport yet to\nsolve the riddle of quantum gravity; it is more of an insurance policy against\nthe probable failure of the other approaches. The plan is as follows: the\nintroduction invites students to the fruitful doubts and conundrums besetting\nthe application of even classical gravity. Next, the first experiments\ndetecting quantum gravitational states inoculate us a healthy dose of\nskepticism on some of the current ideologies. In Section 3 we look at the\naction for general relativity as a consequence of gauge theory for quantum\ntensor fields. Section 4 briefly deals with the unimodular variants. Section 5\narrives at non-commutative geometry. I am convinced that, if this is to play a\nrole in quantum gravity, commutative and non-commutative manifolds must be\ntreated on the same footing; which justifies the place granted to the\nreconstruction theorem. Together with Section 3, this part constitutes the main\nbody of the notes. Only very summarily at the end of this section we point to\nsome approaches to gravity within the non-commutative realm. The last section\ndelivers a last dose of skepticism.

We present data from the double-peaked outburst from Faulkes\nTelescope North, the INT, the Keck Telescope, PAIRITEL, the Westerbork\nSynthesis Radio Telescope and the Swift, XMM-Newton and RXTE X-ray missions. We\nstudy the outburst's evolution at various wavelengths. We study the light curve\nmorphology, presenting the first radio-X-ray Spectral Energy Distributions\n(SEDs) for this source and the most detailed UV-IR SEDs for any outbursting\nAMXP. We show simple models that attempt to identify the emission mechanisms\nresponsible. We analyse short-timescale optical variability, and compare a\nmedium resolution optical spectrum with those from 2004. The outburst\nmorphology is unusual for an AMXP, comprising two peaks, the second containing\na 'plateau' of ~ 10 days at maximum brightness within 30 days of the initial\nactivity. This has implications on duty cycles of short-period X-ray\ntransients. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted by a single, hard power-law. We\ndetect optical variability of ~ 0.05 magnitudes, on timescales of minutes, but\nfind no periodic modulation. In the optical, the SEDs contain a blue component,\nindicative of an irradiated disc, and a transient near-infrared (NIR) excess.\nThis excess is consistent with a simple model of an optically thick synchrotron\njet (as seen in other outbursting AMXPs). The optical spectrum shows a\ndouble-peaked H alpha profile, a diagnostic of an accretion disc, but we do not\nclearly see other lines (e.g. He I, II) reported in 2004. Optical/IR\nobservations of AMXPs are excellent for studying the evolution of both the\nouter accretion disc and the inner jet, and may eventually provide us with\ntight constraints to model disc-jet coupling in accreting neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 10:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We argue that a hidden assumption underlies this\nlore: that the scale of gravitational physics, M_g, (e.g. the string scale,\nM_s, in string theory) is of order the Planck mass, M_p = 10^18 GeV. We explore\nsensitivity to this assumption using the spectrum of masses arising within the\nspecific framework of large-volume string compactifications, for which the\nultraviolet completion at the gravity scale is explicitly known to be a Type\nIIB string theory. In such models the separation between M_g and M_p is\nparameterized by the (large) size of the extra dimensional volume, V (in string\nunits), according to M_p: M_g: M_KK: M_3/2 = 1: V^{-1/2}: V^{-2/3}: V^{-1}. We\nfind that the generic size of quantum corrections to masses is of the order of\nM_KK M_3/2 / M_p ~ M_p / V^{5/3}. The mass of the lighest modulus\n(corresponding to the extra-dimensional volume) which at the classical level is\nM_V ~ M_p/V^{3/2} << M_3/2 << M_KK is thus stable against quantum corrections.\nThis is possible because the couplings of this modulus to other forms of matter\nin the low-energy theory are generically weaker than gravitational strength\n(something that is also usually thought not to occur according to standard\nlore).

In this paper, we propose a new method to\ndeconstruct a polarization map on an incomplete sky in real space into purely\nelectric and magnetic polarization type maps, ${\\mathcal{E}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ and\n${\\mathcal{B}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$, respectively. The main properties of our\napproach are as follows: Firstly, the fields ${\\mathcal{E}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ and\n${\\mathcal{B}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ are constructed in real space with a minimal loss\nof information. This loss of information arises due to the removal of a narrow\nedge of the constructed map in order to remove various numerical errors,\nincluding those arising from finite pixel size. Secondly, this method is fast\nand can be efficiently applied to high resolution maps due to the use of the\nfast spherical harmonics transformation. Thirdly, the constructed fields,\n${\\mathcal{E}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ and ${\\mathcal{B}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$, are scalar\nfields.

With these distances, a high resolution\nspectroscopic abundance analysis can be brought to bear on the alleged members\nof these moving groups. If a structure is a relic of an open cluster, the\nmembers can be expected to be monolithic in age and abundance inasmuch as\nhomogeneity is observed in young open clusters.

We derive the formal structure of the\nLPT series expansion, working to arbitrary order in the initial perturbation\namplitude. The factors that regulate LPT convergence are identified by studying\nthe exact, analytic solution expanded according to this formal structure. The\nkey methodology is to complexify the exact solution, demonstrate that it is\nanalytic and apply well-known convergence criteria for power series expansions\nof analytic functions.This analysis fully explains the previously reported\nobservation that LPT fails to predict the evolution of an underdense, open\nregion beyond a certain time. It also implies the existence of other examples,\nincluding overdense, closed regions, for which LPT predictions should also\nfail. We show that this is indeed the case by numerically computing the LPT\nexpansion in these problematic cases. The formal limitations to the validity of\nLPT expansion are considerably more complicated than simply the first\noccurrence of orbit crossings as is often assumed. Evolution to a future time\ngenerically requires re-expanding the solution in overlapping domains that\nultimately link the initial and final times, each domain subject to its own\nconvergence criterion. We demonstrate that it is possible to handle all the\nproblematic cases by taking multiple steps (LPT re-expansion).

The right translation acts minimally on this decomposition,\ntherefore providing a minimal compact metric analogue to the Mackey action.\nThis topological Mackey action is a distal (possibly trivial) extension of a\nweakly mixing factor (possibly trivial), and it is distal if and only if\nperturbation of the Rokhlin skew product is defined by a topological\ncoboundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2010 14:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 19:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

The gateway, which communicates with mobile phone via GSM\nModem, receives the coded queries from users and sends packed results back. The\nsoftware which communicates with the gateway system via SHORT MESSAGE, packs\nusers' requests, IDs and codes, and sends the package to the gateway; then\ninterprets the packed data for the users to read on a page of GUI. Whenever and\nwherever they are, the customer can query the information by sending messages\nthrough the client device which may be mobile phone or PC. The mobile clients\ncan get the appropriate services through the mobile business architecture in\ndistributed environment. The messages are secured through the client side\nencoding mechanism to avoid the intruders. The gateway system is programmed by\nJava, while the software at clients by J2ME and the database is created by\nOracle for reliable and interoperable services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 19:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-26"}

In this paper we propose two minimum\nspanning trees based clustering algorithm. The first algorithm produces k\nclusters with center and guaranteed intra-cluster similarity. The radius and\ndiameter of k clusters are computed to find the tightness of k clusters. The\nvariance of the k clusters are also computed to find the compactness of the\nclusters. The second algorithm is proposed to create a dendrogram using the k\nclusters as objects with guaranteed inter-cluster similarity. The algorithm is\nalso finds central cluster from the k number of clusters. The first algorithm\nuses divisive approach, where as the second algorithm uses agglomerative\napproach. In this paper we used both the approaches to find Informative Meta\nsimilarity clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 19:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-26"}
