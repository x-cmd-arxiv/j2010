We analyze three such cases of failure.\n  First, a simple generalization of the Abraham and Minkowski momenta to\ndispersive media entails multiplying each per-photon momentum by $n/n_g$, where\n$n$ is the refractive index and $n_g$ is the group index. The resulting forms\nare experimentally relevant for the case of the Abraham momentum, but not for\nthe Minkowski momentum. We show how dispersion modulates the displacement of a\nsphere embedded in a dispersive medium by a pulse.\n  Second, pulse transformation in a nonstationary medium is modulated by the\npresence of dispersion. Using an explicit description of the kinetics of\ndispersive nonstationary inhomogeneous media, we show how the group velocity\ncan modulate pulse response to a change in the refractive index and how Doppler\nshifts may become large in a dispersive medium as the velocity of the Doppler\nshifting surface approaches the group velocity. We explain a simple way to use\nexisting technology to either compress or decompress a given pulse, changing\nits bandwidth and spatial extent by several orders of magnitude while otherwise\npreserving its envelope shape.\n  Finally, we note that the nature of a single optical cavity quasimode depends\non intracavity dispersion. We show that the quantum field noise associated with\na single cavity mode may be modulated by dispersion. For a well-chosen mode in\na high-Q cavity, this can amount to either an increase or a decrease in total\nvacuum field energy by several orders of magnitude. We focus on the \"white\nlight cavity,\" showing that the quantum noise of an ideal white light cavity\ndiverges as the cavity finesse improves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2010 16:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-01"}

Classical principles of model\nselection include the Kullback-Leibler divergence principle and the Bayesian\nprinciple, which lead to the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian\ninformation criterion when models are correctly specified. Yet model\nmisspecification is unavoidable when we have no knowledge of the true model or\nwhen we have the correct family of distributions but miss some true predictor.\nIn this paper, we propose a family of semi-Bayesian principles for model\nselection in misspecified models, which combine the strengths of the two\nwell-known principles. We derive asymptotic expansions of the semi-Bayesian\nprinciples in misspecified generalized linear models, which give the new\nsemi-Bayesian information criteria (SIC). A specific form of SIC admits a\nnatural decomposition into the negative maximum quasi-log-likelihood, a penalty\non model dimensionality, and a penalty on model misspecification directly.\nNumerical studies demonstrate the advantage of the newly proposed SIC\nmethodology for model selection in both correctly specified and misspecified\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2010 21:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 07:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

The model consists of\na penetrable core characterized by a finite repulsive energy combined with a\nshort-range attractive well. This is a many-body one-dimensional problem,\nlacking an exact analytical solution, for which the usual van Hove theorem on\nthe absence of phase transition does not apply. We determine a\nhigh-penetrability approximation complementing a similar low-penetrability\napproximation presented in previous work. This is shown to be equivalent to the\nusual Debye-H\\\"{u}ckel theory for simple charged fluids for which the virial\nand energy routes are identical. The internal thermodynamic consistency with\nthe compressibility route and the validity of the approximation in describing\nthe radial distribution function is assessed by a comparison against numerical\nsimulations. The Fisher-Widom line separating the oscillatory and monotonic\nlarge-distance behavior of the radial distribution function is computed within\nthe high-penetrability approximation and compared with the opposite regime,\nthus providing a strong indication of the location of the line in all possible\nregimes. The high-penetrability approximation predicts the existence of a\ncritical point and a spinodal line, but this occurs outside the applicability\ndomain of the theory. We investigate the possibility of a fluid-fluid\ntransition by Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo techniques, not finding any evidence\nof such a transition. Additional analytical arguments are given to support this\nclaim. Finally, we find a clustering transition when Ruelle's stability\ncriterion is not fulfilled.
