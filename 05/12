The cool dust temperatures\nin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphological\ntypes earlier than Sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. The\ntemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only strongly\nbarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. The strong radiation field in the high\nstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component to\nhigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively large\nbulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 17:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We explore a model in which second generation (SG)\nstars form out of a mix of pristine gas and ejecta of the first generation of\nasymptotic giant branch stars. We first study the constraints imposed by the\nspectroscopic data of SG stars in globular clusters on the chemical properties\nof the asymptotic and super asymptotic giant branch ejecta. With a simple\none-zone chemical model, we then explore the formation of the SG population\nabundance patterns focussing our attention on the Na-O, Al-Mg anticorrelations\nand on the helium distribution function. We carry out a survey of models and\nexplore the dependence of the final SG chemical properties on the key\nparameters affecting the gas dynamics and the SG formation process. Finally, we\nuse our chemical evolution framework to build specific models for NGC 2808 and\nM4, two Galactic globular clusters which show different patterns in the Na-O\nand Mg-Al anticorrelation and have different helium distributions. We find that\nthe amount of pristine gas involved in the formation of SG stars is a key\nparameter to fit the observed O-Na and Mg-Al patterns. The helium distribution\nfunction for these models is in general good agreement with the observed one.\nOur models, by shedding light on the role of different parameters and their\ninterplay in determining the final SG chemical properties, illustrate the basic\ningredients, constraints and problems encountered in this self-enrichment\nscenario which must be addressed by more sophisticated chemical and\nhydrodynamic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 17:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The stabilization of phase in this superfluid regime is achieved\nby the formation of bound vortex-antivortex pairs. It is believed that several\ndifferent systems share this common behaviour, when the parameter describing\ntheir ordered state has two degrees of freedom, and the theory has been tested\nfor some of them. However, there has been no direct experimental observation of\nthe phase stabilization mechanism by a bound pair.

The\nmethod is valid to first-order Born approximation and might be applicable to\ncorrect observed visibilities for phase variations due to the imprint of the\nfull three-dimensional ionosphere. It is shown that not the ionospheric\nelectron density distribution is the primary structure to model in\ninterferometry, but its autocorrelation function or equivalent its\npower-spectrum. An exact mathematical expression is derived that provides the\nthree dimensional power-spectrum of the ionospheric electron-density\nfluctuations directly from a rescaled scattered intensity field and an incident\nintensity field convolved with a complex unit phasor that depends on the w-term\nand is defined on the full sky pupil plane. In the limit of a small field of\nview, the method reduces to the single phase screen approximation. Tomographic\nself-calibration can become important in high-dynamic range observations at low\nradio frequencies with wide-field antenna interferometers, because a\nthree-dimensional ionosphere causes a spatially varying convolution of the sky,\nwhereas a single phase screen results in a spatially invariant convolution. A\nthick ionosphere can therefore not be approximated by a single phase screen\nwithout introducing errors in the calibration process. By applying a Radon\nprojection and the Fourier projection-slice theorem, it is shown that the\nphase-screen approach in three dimensions is identical to the tomographic\nmethod. Finally we suggest that residual speckle can cause a diffuse intensity\nhalo around sources, due to uncorrectable ionospheric phase fluctuations in the\nshort integrations, which could pose a fundamental limit on the dynamic range\nin long-integration images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 18:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This process has been well established in mapping the fundamental\ntheory of QCD in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom, which allows for\nquantitative connections and predictions between hardronic observables. A more\ndirect approach to performing the non-perturbative QCD calculations is through\nlattice QCD. These computationally intensive calculations approximate continuum\nphysics with a discretized lattice to extract hadronic phenomena from first\nprinciples. However, as in any approximation, there are multiple systematic\nerrors between lattice QCD calculation and actual hardronic phenomena. To\naccount for these systematic effects in terms of hadronic interactions,\neffective field theory proves to be useful. However, the fundamental theory of\ninterest here is lattice QCD, as opposed to the usual continuum QCD. In this\nwork, the basics of this process are outlined, and multiple original\ncalculations are presented: effective field theory for anisotropic lattices,\nI=2 $\\pi\\pi$ scattering for isotropic, anisotropic, and twisted mass lattices.\nAdditionally, a usage of effective field theories and the employment of an\nisospin chemical potential on the lattice is proposed to extract several\ncomputationally difficult scattering parameters. Lastly, recently proposed\nlocal, chiral lattice actions are analyzed in the framework of effective field\ntheory, which illuminates various challenges in simulating such actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 18:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Since the orientation of a galaxy's\npolarized emission is both unaffected by lensing and is related to the galaxy's\nintrinsic orientation, it effectively provides information on the unlensed\ngalaxy position angle. We derive a new weak lensing estimator which exploits\nthis effect and makes full use of both the observed galaxy shapes and the\nestimates of the intrinsic position angles as provided by polarization. Our\nmethod has the potential to both reduce the effects of shot noise, and to\nreduce to negligible levels, in a model-independent way, all effects of\nintrinsic galaxy alignments. We test our technique on simulated weak lensing\nskies, including an intrinsic alignment contaminant consistent with recent\nobservations, in three overlapping redshift bins. Adopting a standard weak\nlensing analysis and ignoring intrinsic alignments results in biases of 5-10%\nin the recovered power spectra and cosmological parameters. Applying our new\nestimator to one tenth the number of galaxies used for the standard case, we\nrecover both power spectra and the input cosmology with similar precision as\ncompared to the standard case and with negligible residual bias, even in the\npresence of a substantial (astrophysical) scatter in the relationship between\nthe observed orientation of the polarized emission and the intrinsic\norientation. Assuming a reasonable polarization fraction for star-forming\ngalaxies, and no cosmological conspiracy in the relationship between\npolarization direction and intrinsic morphology, our estimator should prove a\nvaluable tool for weak lensing analyses of forthcoming radio surveys, in\nparticular, deep wide field surveys with e-MERLIN, MeerKAT and ASKAP and\nultimately, definitive radio lensing surveys with the SKA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We find evidence for a freely-expanding and\nnon-relativistic explosion with an average blastwave velocity, v~0.2c, and a\ntotal internal energy for the radio emitting material of E ~ 2 x 10^46 erg\nassuming equipartition of energy between electrons and magnetic fields\n(epsilon_e=epsilon_B=0.1).

High foreground\nextinction can lead to situations where young stellar objects (YSOs) appear to\nbe in earlier evolutionary stages than they actually are, particularly when\nusing simple criteria like spectral indices. To address this issue, we have\nassembled detailed SED characterizations of a sample of 56 Spitzer-identified\ncandidate YSOs in the clusters NGC 2264 and IC 348. For these, we use spectra\nobtained with the Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope and\nancillary multi-wavelength photometry. The primary aim is twofold: 1) to\ndiscuss the role of spectral features, particularly those due to ices and\nsilicates, in determining a YSO's evolutionary stage, and 2) to perform\ncomprehensive modeling of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) enhanced by the\nIRS data. The SEDs consist of ancillary optical-to-submillimeter\nmulti-wavelength data as well as an accurate description of the 9.7 micron\nsilicate feature and of the mid-infrared continuum derived from line-free parts\nof the IRS spectra. We find that using this approach, we can distinguish\ngenuine protostars in the cluster from T Tauri stars masquerading as protostars\ndue to external foreground extinction. Our results underline the importance of\nphotometric data in the far-infrared/submillimeter wavelength range, at\nsufficiently high angular resolution to more accurately classify cluster\nmembers. Such observations are becoming possible now with the advent of the\nHerschel Space Observatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 20:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A common formalism to approach QS is the\nreplicator-mutator equation (RME). However, a problem with the RME is how to\nquantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is\naddressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche\ntheory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of\nresources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing\nindividuals (the different viral variants that constitute the QS). Using this\nnovel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping, for\ndescribing QS, we explore the population distributions of viral variants that\nemerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population\ndistribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B)\nto show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and\nrecent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or\nfacilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve\nboth A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of\ncooperation is the Shannon entropy. Therefore, in order to get a typical\nquasispecies profile, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Rather,\nsome degree of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several\nbiological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms\noperating in QS dynamics and to understand the QS as a whole entity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 21:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-13"}

We argue\nthat the symmetric-side channel -- which distributes quantum information\nsymmetrically between the receiver and the environment -- is a good candidate\nfor a notion of public quantum communication in entanglement distillation and\nquantum error correction.\n  This connection is partially motivated by [Brand\\~ao and Oppenheim,\narXiv:1004.3328], where it was found that if a sender would like to communicate\na secret message to a receiver through an insecure quantum channel using a\nshared quantum state as a key, then the insecure quantum channel is only ever\nused to simulate a symmetric-side channel, and can always be replaced by it\nwithout altering the optimal rate. Here we further show, in complete analogy to\nthe role of public classical communication, that assistance by a symmetric-side\nchannel makes equal the distillable entanglement, the recently-introduced\nmutual independence, and a generalization of the latter, which quantifies the\nextent to which one of the parties can perform quantum privacy amplification.\n  Symmetric-side channels, and the closely related erasure channel, have been\nrecently harnessed to provide examples of superactivation of the quantum\nchannel capacity. Our findings give new insight into this non-additivity of the\nchannel capacity and its relation to quantum privacy. In particular, we show\nthat single-copy superactivation protocols with the erasure channel, which\nencompasses all examples of non-additivity of the quantum capacity found to\ndate, can be understood as a conversion of mutual independence into distillable\nentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 00:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

To keep the stability\nof the whole network, congestion control algorithms have been extensively\nstudied. Queue management method employed by the routers is one of the\nimportant issues in the congestion control study. Active queue management (AQM)\nhas been proposed as a router-based mechanism for early detection of congestion\ninside the network. In this paper we analyzed several active queue management\nalgorithms with respect to their abilities of maintaining high resource\nutilization, identifying and restricting disproportionate bandwidth usage, and\ntheir deployment complexity. We compare the performance of FRED, BLUE, SFB, and\nCHOKe based on simulation results, using RED and Drop Tail as the evaluation\nbaseline. The characteristics of different algorithms are also discussed and\ncompared. Simulation is done by using Network Simulator(NS2) and the graphs are\ndrawn using X- graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 05:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-15"}

In addition, [OI]\nemission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,\nand is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.\nEnvelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.\nThey indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellar\nluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with PACS,\nincluding CO lines with upper levels at >2500 K above the ground state.\nInstead, warm CO and H2O emission is probably produced in the walls of an\noutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by UV photons and\nnon-dissociative C-type shocks. The bright OH and [OI] emission is attributed\nto J-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. In the scenario described\nhere, the combined cooling by far-IR lines within the central spatial pixel is\nestimated to be 2 \\times 10-2 L_sun, with 60-80% attributed to J- and C-type\nshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 09:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The strong spin-orbit coupling splits them into two groups. The\nmagnetization is investigated in terms of two vector fields ${\\bf M}_{1i}$ and\n${\\bf M}_{2i}$ which identify the local orientation of the magnetization of the\ntwo groups of $f$ electrons. Renormalized spin-wave theory, which accounts for\nthe magnon-magnon interaction, and its extension are developed to describe two\nferromagnetic phases in the system: low temperature large moment phase\n$0<T<T^{*}$ (FM2), where all $5f$ electrons contribute the ordered\nferromagnetic moment, and high temperature low-moment phase $T^{*}<T<T_C$\n(FM1), where $f$ electrons are partially ordered. Both phases are strictly\nferromagnetic in accordance with experiment. The magnetization as a function of\ntemperature is calculated. The anomalous temperature dependence of the ordered\nmoment, known from the experiments with $UGe_2$, is very well reproduced\ntheoretically. Below $T_x$ ($T^*$ in the present paper) the ferromagnetic\nmoment increases in an anomalous way. The new understanding of the anomalous\n$FM2\\to FM1$ transition, as a result of the magnetic order of two well\nseparated groups of $f$ electrons, yields the key to an understanding of the\nferromagnetism and transport properties in these compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 09:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Such chaos associated with rheological response occurs in\nregimes where the Reynolds number is very small. It must thus arise as a\nconsequence of the coupling of the flow to internal structural variables\ndescribing the local state of the fluid. We propose a coupled map lattice (CML)\nmodel for such complex spatio-temporal behaviour in a passively sheared nematic\nliquid crystal, using local maps constructed so as to accurately describe the\nspatially homogeneous case. Such local maps are coupled diffusively to nearest\nand next nearest neighbours to mimic the effects of spatial gradients in the\nunderlying equations of motion. We investigate the dynamical steady states\nobtained as parameters in the map and the strength of the spatial coupling are\nvaried, studying local temporal properties at a single site as well as\nspatio-temporal features of the extended system. Our methods reproduce the full\nrange of spatio-temporal behaviour seen in earlier one-dimensional studies\nbased on partial differential equations. We report results for both the one and\ntwo-dimensional cases, showing that spatial coupling favours uniform or\nperiodically time-varying states, as intuitively expected. We demonstrate and\ncharacterize regimes of spatio-temporal intermittency out of which chaos\ndevelops. Our work suggests that such simplified lattice representations of the\nspatio-temporal dynamics of complex fluids under shear may provide useful\ninsights as well as fast and numerically tractable alternatives to continuum\nrepresentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 10:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The velocity of the upward expansion of the\nwave dome ($v \\sim 650$ km s$^{-1}$) is larger than that of the lateral\nexpansion of the wave ($v \\sim 280$ km s$^{-1}$), indicating that the upward\ndome expansion is driven all the time, and thus depends on the CME speed,\nwhereas in the lateral direction it is freely propagating after the CME lateral\nexpansion stops.

Furthermore, we\ndevelop asymptotically tight high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations,\nwhich offer important insights into the influence of various system and channel\nparameters on the AOR and AOD.

In CMEs\nthey are believed to indicate the opening up of the coronal magnetic fields at\nthe start of the eruption. Aims: It is to determine whether coronal dimming\nseen in small-scale eruptions starts before or after chromospheric plasma\nejection. Methods: One STEREO spacecraft obtained high cadence, 75 s, images in\nthe He II 304A channel, and the other simultaneous images in the Fe IX/FeX 171A\nchannel. We concentrate on two well-positioned chromospheric eruptions that\noccurred at disk center in the 171A images, and on the limb in 304A. One was in\nthe quiet Sun and the other was in an equatorial coronal hole. We compare the\ntiming of chromospheric eruption seen in the 304A limb images with the\nbrightenings and dimmings seen on disk in the 171A images. Further we use\noff-limb images of the low frequency 171A power to infer the coronal structure\nnear the eruptions. Results: In both the quiet Sun and the coronal hole\neruption, on disk 171A dimming was seen before the chromospheric eruption, and\nin both cases it extends beyond the site of the chromospheric eruption. The\nquiet Sun eruption occurred on the outer edge of the enclosing magnetic field\nof a prominence and may be related to a small disruption of the prominence just\nbefore the 171A dimming. Conclusions: These small-scale chromospheric eruptions\nstarted with a dimming in coronal emission just like their larger counterparts.\nWe therefore suggest that a fundamental step in triggering them was the removal\nof overlying coronal field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 13:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The simple case of an\ninitially log-normal distributed scatter in black hole and bulge masses\ncombined with random merging within the galaxy population results in a\ndecreasing scatter with merging generation/number as predicted by the\nCentral-limit theorem.

Here we\nreport on geometrical constraints which impede the formation of quasicrystals\nwith certain symmetries in a colloidal model system. Experimentally, colloidal\nquasicrystals are created by subjecting micron-sized particles to\ntwo-dimensional quasiperiodic potential landscapes created by n=5 or seven\nlaser beams. Our results clearly demonstrate that quasicrystalline order is\nmuch easier established for n = 5 compared to n = 7. With increasing laser\nintensity we observe that the colloids first adopt quasiperiodic order at local\nareas which then laterally grow until an extended quasicrystalline layer forms.\nAs nucleation sites where quasiperiodicity originates, we identify highly\nsymmetric motifs in the laser pattern. We find that their density strongly\nvaries with n and surprisingly is smallest exactly for those quasicrystalline\nsymmetries which have never been observed in atomic systems. Since such high\nsymmetry motifs also exist in atomic quasicrystals where they act as\npreferential adsorption sites, this suggests that it is indeed the deficiency\nof such motifs which accounts for the absence of materials with e.g. 7-fold\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 15:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-13"}

The homogeneous elements of the universal\ndifferential algebra are naturally identified with operators living in tensor\npowers of Quantum Spacetime; this allows us to compute their spectra. In\nparticular, we consider operators that can be interpreted as distances, areas,\n3- and 4-volumes. The Minkowski distance operator between two independent\nevents is shown to have pure Lebesgue spectrum with infinite multiplicity. The\nEuclidean distance operator is shown to have spectrum bounded below by a\nconstant of the order of the Planck length. The corresponding statement is\nproved also for both the space-space and space-time area operators, as well as\nfor the Euclidean length of the vector representing the 3-volume operators.\nHowever, the space 3-volume operator (the time component of that vector) is\nshown to have spectrum equal to the whole complex plane. All these operators\nare normal, while the distance operators are also selfadjoint. The Lorentz\ninvariant spacetime volume operator, representing the 4- volume spanned by five\nindependent events, is shown to be normal. Its spectrum is pure point with a\nfinite distance (of the order of the fourth power of the Planck length) away\nfrom the origin. The mathematical formalism apt to these problems is developed\nand its relation to a general formulation of Gauge Theories on Quantum Spaces\nis outlined. As a byproduct, a Hodge Duality between the absolute dif-\nferential and the Hochschild boundary is pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 15:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
