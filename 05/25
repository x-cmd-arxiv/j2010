Average path\nlengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size,\nbut the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a\ncharacteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within\ncommunities, whose roles differ across categories.

Indeed, 91% +- 29% of the CTTS with naked photospheres\nexhibit pure spot-like variability, while only 18% +- 7% of the thick disk\nsystems do so, presumably those seen at low inclination and thus free of\nvariable obscuration. AA Tau-like light curves are found to be fairly common,\nwith a frequency of at least ~ 30 to 40% in young stars with inner dusty disks.\nThe temporal evolution of the light curves indicates that the structure of the\ninner disk warp, located close to the corotation radius and responsible for the\nobscuration episodes, varies over a timescale of a few (~ 1-3) rotational\nperiods. This probably reflects the highly dynamical nature of the star-disk\nmagnetospheric interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 17:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Taking into account that the mass of the\nvisible universe is M=2x10^{53} kg, it appears that the entire visible universe\nis inside a {\\it photon sphere} of radius R_{ps} = 14.3 Gpc. The current model\nfor the visible universe must be corrected to account for the fact that\nmeasured horizon distance of 14.0 \\pm 0.2 Gpc is not a straight line. Rather it\nis an arc of a circle with that length, because all photons are inside the\nphoton sphere. Our model interprets the visible universe as a surface of a\nsphere (or an inside of a sphere shell) with radius 4.46 \\pm 0.06 Gpc and an\nevent horizon, located on that sphere (shell), with size of 14.0 \\pm 0.2 Gpc.\nThe model predicts CMB redshift and time dilatation of Type Ia supernovae by\ngravitation.

Through relativistic energy\ncorrection, our model also provides an explanation for critical density without\nuse of dark matter. It explains that Type Ia supernovae redshifts are not\nrelated to the accelerated expansion of the universe and dark energy. It\nexplains the reason for the established discrepancy between the non-covariant\nversion of the holographic principle and the calculated dimensionless entropy\n(S/k) for the visible universe, which exceeds the entropy of a black hole.

Methods: The VMAT optimization problem is formulated as a\nlarge-scale convex programming problem solved by a column generation approach.\nWe consider a cost function consisting two terms, the first which enforces a\ndesired dose distribution while the second guarantees a smooth dose rate\nvariation between successive gantry angles. At each iteration of the column\ngeneration method, a subproblem is first solved to generate one more\ndeliverable MLC aperture which potentially decreases the cost function most\neffectively. A subsequent master problem is then solved to determine the dose\nrate at all currently generated apertures by minimizing the cost function. The\niteration of such an algorithm yields a set of deliverable apertures, as well\nas dose rates, at all gantry angles. Results: The algorithm was preliminarily\ntested on five prostate and five head-and-neck clinical cases, each with one\nfull gantry rotation and without any couch/collimator rotations. Compared to\ncorresponding co-planar IMRT treatment plans (9 fields for prostate cases and 5\nfields for head-and-neck cases), the VMAT plans delivered much lower doses to\ncritical structures and more conformal doses to targets. Moreover, extremely\nhigh efficiency has been achieved in our algorithm. It takes only 5~8 minutes\non CPU (MATLAB code on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU) and 18~31 seconds on GPU\n(CUDA code on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card) to generate such a plan.\nConclusions: We have developed an aperture-based VMAT optimization algorithm\nwhich can generate clinically deliverable and high quality treatment plans at\nvery high efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 18:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We present theoretical\nmodels of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a\n(50Mpc/h)^3 volume. Our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds and\nassumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. The predicted galaxy-dust\ncorrelation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlation\nfunction, and reproducing the MSFR data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of\n0.24, about half the value in the Galactic ISM. Roughly half of the reddening\narises in dust that is more than 100Kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. We\nalso examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smaller\nfraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires an\nunphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the MSFR data. In both\nmodels, the signal is dominated by sightlines with E(g-i)=0.001-0.1. The\nno-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddening\nto arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 Msun. The wind model predicts a mean\nvisual extinction of A_V ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with a\nsightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could be\nsignificant for future supernova cosmology studies. Reproducing the MSFR\nresults in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ISM dust survive\nits expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.\nFuture observational studies that provide higher precision and measure the\ndependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for models\nof enriched galactic outflows and the survival of IG dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2011 09:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-06"}

This cool gas can travel above the galactic disk\nin less than 2 Myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.\nOnce above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, and\nsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, which\ndrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. Because the\nradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas\nis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction if\nthey do eventually encounter hot gas. Therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,\nradiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. We identify these\ncluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. Another implication of\nour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, are\nable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. We\nfind that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cool\noutflows will be launched to be ~0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreement\nwith observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2010 20:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By defining an appropriate distortion measure\nbetween an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the successful decoding\ncondition, for a single errors-and-erasures decoding trial, becomes equivalent\nto distortion being less than a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of\nerasure patterns also turns into a covering problem which can be solved\nasymptotically by rate-distortion theory.

The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are\nusually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability\nrequires significant effort in showing that the rules are \"local\" in some\nsense.

Neither the formation mechanism nor the\nresulting structure and internal kinematics of these disks (or disk-like\noutflows) are well known. However, rapid rotation, lifting the material from\nthe equatorial surface region, seems to play a fundamental role. The B[e]\nsupergiant LHA 115-S 65 (S65) in the SMC is one of the two most rapidly\nrotating B[e] stars known. Its almost edge-on orientation allows a detailed\nkinematical study of its optically thin forbidden emission lines. With a focus\non the [OI] lines, we test the two plausible disk scenarios: the outflowing and\nthe Keplerian rotating disk. Based on high- and low-resolution optical spectra,\nwe investigate the density and temperature structure in those disk regions that\nare traced by the [OI] emission to constrain the disk sizes and mass fluxes\nneeded to explain the observed [OI] line luminosities. In addition, we compute\nthe emerging line profiles expected for either an outflowing disk or a\nKeplerian rotating disk, which can directly be compared to the observed\nprofiles. Both disk scenarios deliver reasonably good fits to the line\nluminosities and profiles of the [OI] lines. Nevertheless, the Keplerian disk\nmodel seems to be the more realistic one, because it also agrees with the\nkinematics derived from the large number of additional lines in the spectrum.\nAs additional support for the presence of a high-density, gaseous disk, the\nspectrum shows two very intense and clearly double-peaked [CaII] lines. We\ndiscuss a possible disk-formation mechanism, and similarities between S65 and\nthe group of LBVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 08:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-29"}

This paper reports the first results of this program, presenting a\nPACS map of the o-H2O 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflow\nL1157. The 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,\nand with previous single-pointing ISO, SWAS, and Odin water observations of the\nsame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.\nStrong H2O peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the central\nsource position. The H2O 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emission\nfrom H2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significant\nenhancement of the water abundance. Water emission peaks along the outflow also\ncorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as SiO and\nNH3. A strong H2O peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,\nwhere none of the other molecules have significant emission. The absolute 179\num intensity and its intensity ratio to the H2O 557 GHz line previously\nobserved with Odin/SWAS indicate that the water emission originates in warm\ncompact clumps, spatially unresolved by PACS, having a H2O abundance of the\norder of 10^-4. This testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time long\nenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygen\ninto water.

It\nfollows from the examination of consecutive WMAP data releases that the maximum\nlikelihood value of the quadrupole ratio $R$, which characterizes the amount of\nrelic gravitational waves, increases up to $R=0.264$, and the interval\nseparating this value from the point $R=0$ (the hypothesis of no gravitational\nwaves) increases up to a $2\\sigma$ level. The primordial spectra of density\nperturbations and gravitational waves remain blue in the relevant interval of\nwavelengths, but the spectral indices increase up to $n_s =1.111$ and\n$n_t=0.111$. Assuming that the maximum likelihood estimates of the perturbation\nparameters that we found from WMAP7 data are the true values of the parameters,\nwe find that the signal-to-noise ratio $S/N$ for the detection of relic\ngravitational waves by the Planck experiment increases up to $S/N=4.04$, even\nunder pessimistic assumptions with regard to residual foreground contamination\nand instrumental noises. We comment on theoretical frameworks that, in the case\nof success, will be accepted or decisively rejected by the Planck observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 12:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 08:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 18:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This has ramifications for predictions of the observability of\nprotoplanetary disks, for which gas-only studies will provide an inaccurate\npicture. Specifically, criteria for gap opening in the presence of a planet\nhave generally been studied for the gas phase, whereas the situation can be\nquite different in the dust layer once grains reach mm sizes, which is what\nwill be observed by ALMA. Aims: We aim to investigate the formation and\nstructure of a planetary gap in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk with an\nembedded planet. Methods: We perform 3D, gas+dust SPH simulations of a\nprotoplanetary disk with a planet on a fixed circular orbit at 40 AU to study\nthe evolution of both the gas and dust distributions and densities in the disk.\nWe run a series of simulations in which the planet mass and the dust grain size\nvaries.

For a massive enough planet, we note that cm-sized\ngrains remain inside the gap in corotation and that their population in the\nouter disk shows an asymmetric structure, a signature of disk-planet\ninteractions even for a circular planetary orbit, which should be observable\nwith ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 13:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that gravity can control the\ninertial effects of the shear up to frequencies that are high enough for the\nsurface tension to play a relevant role. This explains why surface tension is a\nnecessary condition for well-posedness while the (low frequency) main dynamics\nof interfacial waves is unaffected by it. In order to derive a practical\nversion of this criterion, we work with a nondimensionalized version of the\nequations and allow for the possibility of various asymptotic regimes, such as\nthe shallow water limit. This limit being singular, we have to derive a new\nsymbolic analysis of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator that includes an infinitely\nsmoothing \"tail\" accounting for the contribution of the bottom.

A class of space-times with closed\ntimelike curves describing cosmic strings and cylinders is studied in detail.\nIn such space-times, both massive particles as well as photons can reach the\nnon-causal region.

Exact solutions for the equation of\nmotion of massive scalar field propagating in cosmic strings and cylinder\nspace-times are presented. Quasinormal modes for the scalar field have been\ncalculated in static and rotating cosmic cylinders. We found unstable modes in\nthe rotating cases.

Two different models are analysed. In the first model, the\ninfection status of an individual is predetermined, perhaps due to partial\nimmunity, and in the second, the infection status of an individual depends on\nthe infection status of its infector and on whether the individual was infected\nby a within- or between-household contact. The first scenario may be modelled\nusing a multitype household epidemic model, and the second scenario by a model\nwe denote by the infector-dependent-severity household epidemic model. Large\npopulation results of the two models are derived, with the focus being on the\ndistribution of the total numbers of mild and severe cases in a typical\nhousehold, of any given size, in the event that the epidemic becomes\nestablished. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether it is possible to\ndetermine which of the two underlying explanations is causing the varying\nresponse when given final size household outbreak data containing mild and\nsevere cases. We conduct numerical studies which show that, given data on\nsufficiently many households, it is generally possible to discriminate between\nthe two models by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the two fitted\nmodels to these data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 13:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-26"}

The average value of the power-law index alpha is -2, that\nof beta is 2.5, whereas the characteristic mass m_c is in the range 0.1 - 0.8\nMsolar and does not seem to vary in any systematic way with the present cluster\nparameters such as metal abundance, total cluster mass or central\nconcentration. However, m_c shows a remarkable correlation with the dynamical\nage of the cluster, namely m_c/Msolar ~ 0.15 + 0.5 tau_dyn^0.75, where tau_dyn\nis the dynamical age taken as the ratio of cluster age and dissolution time.\nThe small scatter seen around this correlation is consistent with the\nuncertainties on the estimated value of tau_dyn. We attribute the observed\ntrend to the onset of mass segregation via two-body relaxation in a tidal\nenvironment, causing the preferential loss of low-mass stars from the cluster\nand hence a drift of the characteristic mass m_c towards higher values. If\ndynamical evolution is indeed at the origin of the observed trend, it would\nseem plausible that high-concentration globular clusters, now with median m_c ~\n0.33 Msolar, were born with a stellar MF very similar to that measured today in\nthe youngest Galactic clusters and with a value of m_c ~ 0.15 Msolar. This\nhypothesis is consistent with the absence of a turn-over in the MF of the\nGalactic bulge down to the observational limit at ~0.2 Msolar and, if correct,\nit would carry the implication that the characteristic mass is not set by the\nthermal Jeans mass of the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 14:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We find a logarithmic scaling for\nthe entanglement entropy of a segment neighboring the impurity. The prefactor\nof the logarithm varies continuously and contains an impurity contribution\ndescribed by a one-parameter function, while the contribution of the unmodified\nboundary enters additively. The coefficient is found explicitly by pointing out\nsimilarities with other models involving interface defects. The proposed\nformula gives excellent agreement with our numerical data. If the segment has\nan open boundary, one finds a rapidly oscillating subleading term in the\nentropy that persists in the limit of large block sizes. The particle number\nfluctuation inside the subsystem is also reported.

While some techniques make automatic mesh\ngeneration possible, in most cases, manual mesh generation is preferred for\nbetter control over the sub-domain representation, element type, layout and\nrefinement that it provides. Yet, this option is time consuming and not suited\nfor intraoperative situations where model generation and computation time is\ncritical. To overcome this problem we propose a fast and automatic mesh\ngeneration technique based on the elastic registration of a generic mesh to the\nspecific target organ in conjunction with element regularity and quality\ncorrection. This Mesh-Match-and-Repair (MMRep) approach combines control over\nthe mesh structure along with fast and robust meshing capabilities, even in\nsituations where only partial organ geometry is available. The technique was\nsuccessfully tested on a database of 5 pre-operatively acquired complete femora\nCT scans, 5 femoral heads partially digitized at intraoperative stage, and 50\nCT volumes of patients' heads. The MMRep algorithm succeeded in all 60 cases,\nyielding for each patient a hex-dominant, Atlas based, Finite Element mesh with\nsubmillimetric surface representation accuracy, directly exploitable within a\ncommercial FE software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2010 13:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-31"}
