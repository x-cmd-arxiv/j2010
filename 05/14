Recently,\nSpitzer has identified a new class of \"pre-transitional disks\" with gaps; these\nobjects have an optically thick inner disk separated from an optically thick\nouter disk by an optically thin disk gap. A near-infrared spectrum provided the\nfirst confirmation of a gap in the pre-transitional disk of LkCa 15 by\nverifying that the near-infrared excess emission in this object was due to an\noptically thick inner disk. Here we investigate the difference between the\nnature of the inner regions of transitional and pre-transitional disks using\nthe same veiling-based technique to extract the near-infrared excess emission\nabove the stellar photosphere. We show that the near-infrared excess emission\nof the previously identified pre-transitional disks of LkCa 15 and UX Tau A in\nTaurus as well as the newly identified pre-transitional disk of ROX 44 in\nOphiuchus can be fit with an inner disk wall located at the dust destruction\nradius. We also model the broad-band SEDs of these objects, taking into account\nthe effect of shadowing by the inner disk on the outer disk, considering the\nfinite size of the star. The near-infrared excess continua of these three\npre-transitional disks, which can be explained by optically thick inner disks,\nare significantly different from that of the transitional disks of GM Aur,\nwhose near-infrared excess continuum can be reproduced by emission from\nsub-micron-sized optically thin dust, and DM Tau, whose near-infrared spectrum\nis consistent with a disk hole that is relatively free of small dust. The\nstructure of pre-transitional disks may be a sign of young planets forming in\nthese disks and future studies of pre-transitional disks will provide\nconstraints to aid in theoretical modeling of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 16:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

For an arbitrary Lie group, basic equations and non standard invariant\nLagrangian forms are described. Covariant constraint equations that place\nrestrictions on field components are presented. With G = SU(2), a detail\napplication to the electroweak model is discussed. We first show that the\nstandard Lagrangian for the gauge $SU(2) \\times U(1)$ electroweak model is\ninvariant. We then show that an alternate invariant Lagrangian is also\npossible. In it, the intermediate boson masses arise from the adjoint field\nrather than from the Higgs doublet. An alternate invariant lepton Lagrangian is\npresented. Covariant constraints on the right-handed lepton field lead to two\nright-handed neutrino fields. One vanishes at the point where we obtain a\nmassless (photon) field and the second one has no interaction. This provides a\nclear explanation why weak interactions do not involve right-handed neutrinos,\nwhile permitting neutrinos with mass. This model also indicates a different\nregion of matter involving coupled leptons that are \"blind\" to the massless\nelectromagnetic field but \"see\" four massive potentials that are themselves\nblind to the electromagnetic field.

We define an\nexo-Earth as a planet of 1 to 10 Earth masses orbiting in the habitable zone\n(HZ) of a solar-type star. We show that for a survey strategy that relies on a\nsingle image to detect an exo-Earth, roughly half of all exo-Earth detections\nwill be false alarms. Here, a false alarm is a mistaken identification of a\nplanet as an exo-Earth. We consider two survey strategies designed to mitigate\nthe false alarm problem. The first is to require that for each potential\nexo-Earth, a sufficient number of detections are made to measure the orbit.\nWhen the orbit is known we can determine if the planet is in the habitable\nzone. With this strategy, we find that the number of exo-Earths found is on\naverage 0.9, 1.9 and 2.7 for {\\eta}_Earth = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3.

We find\nthat with prior space-based astrometry from a survey of 60 nearby stars, JWST\nplus an external occulter can obtain orbital solutions for the majority (70% to\n80%) of the exo-Earths orbiting these 60 stars. The exo-Earth yield is\napproximately five times higher than the yield for the JWST plus occulter\nmission without prior astrometry.

This representation allows us to develop a canonical direct sum\ndecomposition of an arbitrary game into three components, which we refer to as\nthe potential, harmonic and nonstrategic components. We analyze natural classes\nof games that are induced by this decomposition, and in particular, focus on\ngames with no harmonic component and games with no potential component. We show\nthat the first class corresponds to the well-known potential games. We refer to\nthe second class of games as harmonic games, and study the structural and\nequilibrium properties of this new class of games. Intuitively, the potential\ncomponent of a game captures interactions that can equivalently be represented\nas a common interest game, while the harmonic part represents the conflicts\nbetween the interests of the players. We make this intuition precise, by\nstudying the properties of these two classes, and show that indeed they have\nquite distinct and remarkable characteristics. For instance, while finite\npotential games always have pure Nash equilibria, harmonic games generically\nnever do. Moreover, we show that the nonstrategic component does not affect the\nequilibria of a game, but plays a fundamental role in their efficiency\nproperties, thus decoupling the location of equilibria and their payoff-related\nproperties. Exploiting the properties of the decomposition framework, we obtain\nexplicit expressions for the projections of games onto the subspaces of\npotential and harmonic games. This enables an extension of the properties of\npotential and harmonic games to \"nearby\" games. We exemplify this point by\nshowing that the set of approximate equilibria of an arbitrary game can be\ncharacterized through the equilibria of its projection onto the set of\npotential games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 19:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 03:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The\namplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for L < L_* and increases\nsharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(>L)=1.06+0.23(L/L_*)^{1.12}.\nAt fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), a\ntrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. The\nindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations are\nstrikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)\nwith luminosity, at all scales. The large-scale clustering of red galaxies\nshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L > 4L_*, but the\nlowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L_*) show very strong clustering on\nscales r_p < 2 Mpc/h. Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood\nwithin the LCDM+HOD framework. The growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflects\nan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in the\nminimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one\nsatellite galaxy brighter than L is M_1 ~ 17 Mmin(L) over most of the\nluminosity range. The growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxies\nreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high\nmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that is\nespecially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in\ntabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy\nformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,\nand new cosmological tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 20:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 17:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Our general formulation shows that the relative velocity has\ncontributions from two terms, referred to as the generalized acceleration and\ngeneralized shear terms, because they reduce to the well known acceleration and\nshear terms in the Saffman-Turner limit. The generalized shear term represents\nparticles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories and\ndepends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. The\nimportance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relative\nvelocity is emphasized. We find that our model with a two-phase separation\nbehavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found by\nrecent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particle\npairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at low\nReynolds numbers. In the monodisperse case with identical particles, the\ngeneralized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determined\nby the generalized shear term. At large Reynolds numbers, our model gives a\n$St^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the Stokes number $St$ in the\ninertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the Richardson separation\nlaw. This leads to the same inertial-range scaling for the two-phase separation\nthat well fits the simulation results. Our calculations for the bidisperse case\nshow that, with the friction timescale of one particle fixed, the relative\nspeed as a function of the other particle's friction time has a dip when the\ntwo timescales are similar. We find that the primary contribution at the dip is\nfrom the generalized shear term, while the generalized acceleration term is\ndominant for particles of very different sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 20:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Our results broadly confirm the canonical picture\nthat most Ly-alpha absorbers arise from highly ionized gas tracing filamentary\nlarge-scale structure. Growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffuse\nphotoionized IGM into other cosmic phases, namely stars, cold and hot gas\nwithin galaxy halos, and the unbound and shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic\nmedium (WHIM). By today, baryons are roughly equally divided between bound\nphases (35%), the diffuse IGM (41%), and the WHIM (24%).

To achieve flavor violation is a challenging issue in the scenario,\nsince the Yukawa couplings are originally higher dimensional gauge\ninteractions. We argue that the presence of Z_2-odd bulk masses of fermions\nplays a crucial role as the new source of flavor violation. Although\nintroducing brane-localized mass terms in addition to the bulk masses is\nnecessary to realize flavor mixing, if the bulk masses were universal among\ngenerations, the flavor mixing and flavor changing neutral current processes\nare known to disappear. We also discuss whether natural flavor conservation is\nrealized in the scenario. It is shown that the new source of flavor violation\nleads to flavor changing neutral current processes at the tree level due to the\nexchange of non-zero Kaluza-Klein gauge bosons. As a typical example we\ncalculate the rate of K^0 - \\bar{K}^0 mixing due to the non-zero Kaluza-Klein\ngluon exchange at the tree level. The obtained result for the mass difference\nof neutral kaon is suppressed by the inverse powers of the compactification\nscale.

We demonstrate that (1) The hierarchical structure formation can\nexplain the characteristics of the observed metallicity distribution function\n(MDF) including a break around [Fe/H]~-4. (2) A high mass IMF of peak mass\n~10Msun with the contribution of binaries, derived from the statistics of\ncarbon enhanced EMP stars (Komiya et al. 2007), predicts the frequency of\nlow-mass survivors consistent with the number of EMP stars observed for\n-4~<[Fe/H]~<-2.5. (3) The stars formed from primordial gas before the first\nsupernova explosions in their host mini-halos are assigned to the HMP stars\nwith [Fe/H]~-5. (4) There is no indication of significant changes in the IMF\nand the binary contribution at metallicity -4~<[Fe/H]~<-2.5, or even larger as\nlong as the field stars of Galactic halo are concerned. We further study the\neffects of the surface pollution through the accretion of ISM along the\nchemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy for low-mass Pop.III and EMP\nsurvivors. Because of shallower potential of smaller halos, the accretion of\nISM in the mini-halos in which these stars were born dominates the surface\nmetal pollution. This can account for the surface iron abundances as observed\nfor the HMP stars if the cooling and concentration of gas in their birth\nmini-halos is taken into account. We also study the feedback effect from the\nvery massive Pop. III stars. The metal pre-pollution by PISNe is shown to be\ncompatible with the observed lack of their nucleosynthetic signatures when some\npositive feedback on gas cooling works and changes IMF from being very massive\nto being high mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 08:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We investigate the\ndifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only\n<200 micron data and then also including >200 micron data (new SPIRE\nobservations) to determine how important having >200 micron data is for\nderiving these dust properties.

The case of attractive interactions between\nparallel dimers on a plaquette was shown to undergo a continuous phase\ntransition with critical exponents close to those of the O(N) tricritical\nuniversality class, a situation which is not easily captured by conventional\nfield theories. That the dimer model is exactly fine-tuned to a highly\nsymmetric point is a non trivial statement which needs careful numerical\ninvestigation. In this paper, we perform an extensive Monte Carlo study of a\ngeneralized dimer model with plaquette and cubic interactions and determine its\nextended phase diagram. We find that when both interactions favor alignment of\nthe dimers, the phase transition is first order, in almost all cases. On the\nopposite, when interactions compete, the transition becomes continuous, with a\ncritical exponent \\eta ~ 0.2. The existence of a tricritical point between the\ntwo regimes is confirmed by simulations on very large size systems and a\nflowgram method. In addition, we find a highly-degenerate crystalline phase at\nvery low temperature in the frustrated regime which is separated from the\ncolumnar phase by a first order transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 13:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It is therefore desirable to be able\nto efficiently and accurately estimate channel statistics. In this paper we\nstudy the problem of optimally placing sensing times over a time window so as\nto get the best estimate on the parameters of an on-off renewal channel. We are\nparticularly interested in a sparse sensing regime with a small number of\nsamples relative to the time window size. Using Fisher information as a\nmeasure, we analytically derive the best and worst sensing sequences under a\nsparsity condition. We also present a way to derive the best/worst sequences\nwithout this condition using a dynamic programming approach. In both cases the\nworst turns out to be the uniform sensing sequence, where sensing times are\nevenly spaced within the window. With these results we argue that without a\npriori knowledge, a robust sensing strategy should be a randomized strategy. We\nthen compare different random schemes using a family of distributions generated\nby the circular $\\beta$ ensemble, and propose an adaptive sensing scheme to\neffectively track time-varying channel parameters.

In this paper, we examine the use of nanopores to probe ion transport\nand to construct functional nanoscale devices. Specifically, we focus on the\nnewly predicted phenomenon of quantized ionic conductance in nanopores as a\nfunction of the effective pore radius - a prediction that yields a particularly\ntransparent way to probe the contribution of dehydration to ionic transport. We\nstudy the role of ionic species in the formation of hydration layers inside and\noutside of pores. We find that the ion type plays only a minor role in the\nradial positions of the predicted steps in the ion conductance. However, ions\nwith higher valency form stronger hydration shells, and thus, provide even more\npronounced, and therefore, more easily detected, drops in the ionic current.\nMeasuring this phenomenon directly, or from the resulting noise, with synthetic\nnanopores would provide evidence of the deviation from macroscopic (continuum)\ndielectric behavior due to microscopic features at the nanoscale and may shed\nlight on the behavior of ions in more complex biological channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 15:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 23:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The difficulty lies in the fact\nthat the space of all surface diffeomorphisms is a complicated functional\nspace, making exhaustive search for the best mapping challenging. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a simple representation of bijective surface maps\nusing Beltrami coefficients (BCs), which are complex-valued functions defined\non surfaces with supreme norm less than 1. Fixing any 3 points on a pair of\nsurfaces, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of surface\ndiffeomorphisms between them and the set of BCs. Hence, every bijective surface\nmap can be represented by a unique BC. Conversely, given a BC, we can\nreconstruct the unique surface map associated to it using the Beltrami\nHolomorphic flow (BHF) method. Using BCs to represent surface maps is\nadvantageous because it is a much simpler functional space, which captures many\nessential features of a surface map. By adjusting BCs, we equivalently adjust\nsurface diffeomorphisms to obtain the optimal map with desired properties. More\nspecifically, BHF gives us the variation of the associated map under the\nvariation of BC. Using this, a variational problem over the space of surface\ndiffeomorphisms can be easily reformulated into a variational problem over the\nspace of BCs. This makes the minimization procedure much easier. More\nimportantly, the diffeomorphic property is always preserved. We test our method\non synthetic examples and real medical applications. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm for surface\nregistration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2010 15:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-19"}

This is because of the need to\nprovide repeatable images with a priori determined parameters.

Originally, the NIST-developed artificial image\ngenerator was designed only to produce the SEM images of gold-on-carbon\nresolution sample for image-sharpness evaluation. Since then, the new improved\nversion of the software was written in C++ programming language and is in the\nPublic Domain. The current version of the software can generate arbitrary\nsamples, any drift function, and many other features. This work describes\nscanning in charged-particle microscopes, which is applied both in the\nartificial image generator and the DCIC technique.
