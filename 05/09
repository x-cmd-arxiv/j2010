This anisotropy provides an intuitive picture of the observed dependence\nof the photocurrent on the magnetic field and the polarization of the light. We\nalso show that the ratio of the pure spin photocurrent to the magnetoelectric\nphotocurrent is approximately equal to the ratio of the kinetic energy to the\nZeeman energy, which enables us to estimate the magnitude of the pure spin\nphotocurrent. The photocurrent density calculated with the help of an\nanisotropic Rashba model and the Kohn-Luttinger model can produce all three\nterms in the fitting formula for measured current, with comparable order of\nmagnitude, but discrepancies are still present and further investigation is\nneeded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2010 16:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2010 04:52:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2011 03:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 01:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

We present a simple experimental\nprocedure to perform microrheological measurements over the widest frequency\nrange possible with optical tweezers. A generalised Langevin equation is used\nto relate the frequency-dependent moduli of the complex fluid to the\ntime-dependent trajectory of a probe particle as it flips between two optical\ntraps that alternately switch on and off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2010 14:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
