Specifically, a blackhole pattern is a\ngroup which is made of a set of nodes in a way such that there are only inlinks\nto this group from the rest nodes in the graph. In contrast, a volcano pattern\nis a group which only has outlinks to the rest nodes in the graph. Both\npatterns can be observed in real world. For instance, in a trading network, a\nblackhole pattern may represent a group of traders who are manipulating the\nmarket. In the paper, we first prove that the blackhole mining problem is a\ndual problem of finding volcanoes. Therefore, we focus on finding the blackhole\npatterns. Along this line, we design two pruning schemes to guide the blackhole\nfinding process. In the first pruning scheme, we strategically prune the search\nspace based on a set of pattern-size-independent pruning rules and develop an\niBlackhole algorithm. The second pruning scheme follows a divide-and-conquer\nstrategy to further exploit the pruning results from the first pruning scheme.\nIndeed, a target directed graphs can be divided into several disconnected\nsubgraphs by the first pruning scheme, and thus the blackhole finding can be\nconducted in each disconnected subgraph rather than in a large graph. Based on\nthese two pruning schemes, we also develop an iBlackhole-DC algorithm. Finally,\nexperimental results on real-world data show that the iBlackhole-DC algorithm\ncan be several orders of magnitude faster than the iBlackhole algorithm, which\nhas a huge computational advantage over a brute-force method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 19:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We\nestimate the SFR combining the emission in Halpha and at 24 mum to calibrate\nthe emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as SFR estimators, as mapped with\nPACS/Herschel. The data are obtained in the framework of the HERM33ES open time\nkey project. There is less emission in the HII regions at 160 mum than at 100\nmum. Over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in Sigma(SFR) we find that the 100\nmum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the SFR, whereas that at 160 mum\nis slightly superlinear. The behaviour of individual star-forming regions is\nsurprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. At high Sigma(SFR), star\nformation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations in\nradiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low Sigma(SFR).\nDetailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will be\nneeded to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess the\nfraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

If CoRoT-7 b has always been a rocky body, evaporation\nmay have driven off almost half its original mass, but the mass loss may depend\nsensitively on the extent of tidal decay of its orbit. As tides caused CoRoT-7\nb's orbit to decay, they brought the planet closer to its host star, thereby\nenhancing the mass loss rate. Such a large mass loss also suggests the\npossibility that CoRoT-7 b began as a gas giant planet and had its original\natmosphere completely evaporated.

Indeed, the\nsubmillimeter maps appear to show a flux depression as well. Furthermore, the\nnear-infrared images detect faint background stars that are less affected by\nextinction inside the dark patch than in its surroundings. We suggest that the\ndark patch is in fact a hole or cavity in the material producing the NGC 1999\nreflection nebula, excavated by protostellar jets from the V 380 Ori multiple\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 20:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These extended sources have enhanced emission in\nthe 4.5um IRAC channel images (which are generally assigned to be green when\nmaking 3-color RGB images from Spitzer data). Green fuzzies are frequently\nfound in the vicinities of massive young stellar objects, and it has been\nestablished that they are in some cases associated with outflows. Nevertheless,\nthe spectral carrier(s) of this enhanced emission is still uncertain. Although\nit has been suggested that Br Alpha, H2, [Fe II], and/or broad CO emission may\nbe contributing to and enhancing the 4.5um flux from these objects, to date\nthere have been no direct observations of the 4-5um spectra of these objects.\nWe report here on the first direct spectroscopic identification of the origin\nof the green fuzzy emission. We obtained spatially resolved L and M band\nspectra for two green fuzzy sources using NIRI on the Gemini North telescope.\nIn the case of one source, G19.88-0.53, we detect three individual knots of\ngreen fuzzy emission around the source. The knots exhibit a pure molecular\nhydrogen line emission spectrum, with the 4.695um v=0-0 S(9) line dominating\nthe emission in the 4-5um wavelength range, and no detected continuum\ncomponent. Our data for G19.88-0.53 prove that green fuzzy emission can be due\nprimarily to emission lines of molecular hydrogen within the bandpass of the\nIRAC 4.5um channel. However, the other target observed, G49.27-0.34, does not\nexhibit any line emission and appears to be an embedded massive young stellar\nobject with a cometary UC HII region. We suggest that the effects of extinction\nin the 3-8um wavelength range and an exaggeration in the color stretch of the\n4.5um filter in IRAC RGB images could lead to embedded sources such as this one\nfalsely appearing \"green\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 21:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this work, we investigate the ~ 8-10\nmicron region in the Spitzer IRS (InfraRed Spectrograph) spectra of 41 low-mass\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs). These data are part of a survey of interstellar\nices in a sample of low-mass YSOs studied in earlier papers in this series. We\nused both an empirical and a local continuum method to correct for the\ncontribution from the 10 micron silicate absorption in the recorded spectra. In\naddition, we conducted a systematic laboratory study of NH3- and\nCH3OH-containing ices to help interpret the astronomical spectra. We clearly\ndetect a feature at ~9 micron in 24 low-mass YSOs. Within the uncertainty in\ncontinuum determination, we identify this feature with the NH3 nu_2 umbrella\nmode, and derive abundances with respect to water between ~2 and 15%.\nSimultaneously, we also revisited the case of CH3OH ice by studying the nu_4\nC-O stretch mode of this molecule at ~9.7 micron in 16 objects, yielding\nabundances consistent with those derived by Boogert et al. 2008 (hereafter\npaper I) based on a simultaneous 9.75 and 3.53 micron data analysis.

Within a suitable\nsupersymmetry truncation allowing for the embedding of the Reissner-Nordstrom\nblack hole, this U(1) is interpreted as nothing but the global R-symmetry of\npure N=2 supergravity.

To do so, we reintroduce in\nmean-field models the results of full 3D MHD calculations of the non-linear\nevolution of a rising flux tube in a convective shell. More specifically, the\nBabcock-Leighton source term is modified to take into account the delay\nintroduced by the rise time of the toroidal structures from the base of the\nconvection zone to the solar surface. We find that the time delays introduced\nin the equations produce large temporal modulation of the cycle amplitude even\nwhen strong and thus rapidly rising flux tubes are considered. Aperiodic\nmodulations of the solar cycle appear after a sequence of period doubling\nbifurcations typical of non-linear systems. The strong effects introduced even\nby small delays is found to be due to the dependence of the delays on the\nmagnetic field strength at the base of the convection zone, the modulation\nbeing much less when time delays remain constant. We do not find any\nsignificant influence on the cycle period except when the delays are made\nartificially strong. A possible new origin of the solar cycle variability is\nhere revealed.

The\nbrightest 100 and 160 um emission region (K2), which is close to the collision\nfront and consists of 3 knots, also shows a high star formation density and\nefficiency and lack of X-ray emission in its most obscured part, but an excess\nin the radio-to-FIR luminosity ratio. This suggests a young stage, too, but\ndifferent conditions in its interstellar medium. Our results provide important\ncheckpoints for numerical simulations of interacting galaxies when modelling\nthe star formation and stellar feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 10:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The morphological study of the Halpha shells shows a\ndisplacement between far-ultraviolet, Halpha, and the SPIRE bands. The cool\ndust emission from SPIRE clearly delineates the Halpha shell structures. The\nvery strong link between the 250um compact emission and the 24um and Halpha\nemissions, by recovering the star formation rate from standard recipes for HII\nregions, allows us to provide star formation rate calibrations based on the\n250um compact emission alone.

These balance functions are presented in terms of\nrelative pseudorapidity, $\\Delta \\eta$, relative rapidity, $\\Delta y$, relative\nazimuthal angle, $\\Delta \\phi$, and invariant relative momentum, $q_{\\rm inv}$.\nIn addition, balance functions are shown in terms of the three components of\n$q_{\\rm inv}$: $q_{\\rm long}$, $q_{\\rm out}$, and $q_{\\rm side}$. For charged\nparticle pairs, the width of the balance function in terms of $\\Delta \\eta$\nscales smoothly with the number of participating nucleons, while HIJING and\nUrQMD model calculations show no dependence on centrality or system size. For\ncharged particle and charged pion pairs, the balance functions widths in terms\nof $\\Delta \\eta$ and $\\Delta y$ are narrower in central Au+Au collisions than\nin peripheral collisions. The width for central collisions is consistent with\nthermal blast-wave models where the balancing charges are highly correlated in\ncoordinate space at breakup. This strong correlation might be explained either\nby delayed hadronization or by limited diffusion during the reaction.\nFurthermore, the narrowing trend is consistent with the lower kinetic\ntemperatures inherent to more central collisions. In contrast, the width of the\nbalance function for charged kaon pairs in terms of $\\Delta y$ shows little\ncentrality dependence, which may signal a different production mechanism for\nkaons. The widths of the balance functions for charged pions and kaons in terms\nof $q_{\\rm inv}$ narrow in central collisions compared to peripheral\ncollisions, which may be driven by the change in the kinetic temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 12:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Central to the idea of typicality is that a sequence $x_1, x_2,\n..., x_n$ that is $P_X$-typical should, loosely speaking, have an empirical\ndistribution that is in some sense close to the distribution $P_X$. The two\nmost common notions of typicality are that of strong (letter) typicality and\nweak (entropy) typicality. While weak typicality allows one to apply many\narguments that can be made with strongly typical arguments, some arguments for\nstrong typicality cannot be generalized to weak typicality. In this paper, we\nconsider an alternate definition of typicality, namely one based on the weak*\ntopology and that is applicable to Polish alphabets (which includes\n$\\reals^n$). This notion is a generalization of strong typicality in the sense\nthat it degenerates to strong typicality in the finite alphabet case, and can\nalso be applied to mixed and continuous distributions. Furthermore, it is\nstrong enough to prove a Markov lemma, and thus can be used to directly prove a\nmore general class of results than weak typicality. As an example of this\ntechnique, we directly prove achievability for Gel'fand-Pinsker channels with\ninput constraints for a large class of alphabets and channels without first\nproving a finite alphabet result and then resorting to delicate quantization\narguments. While this large class does not include Gaussian distributions with\npower constraints, it is shown to be straightforward to recover this case by\nconsidering a sequence of truncated Gaussian distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 13:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-14"}

The motion of the bundle is\ninduced by the pulling forces of the underlying motors which stochastically\nattach to the monomers and, depending on the polarity of the monomers, pull\nthem in the right or left direction. We demonstrate that perfectly a-polar\nchains consisting of equal numbers of monomers with positive and negative\npolarities may exhibit biased bidirectional motion with non-zero drift. This\neffect is attributed to the elastic tension developed in the chain due to the\naction of the myosin motors. We also show that as a result of this tension, the\nattachment probability of the motors is greatly reduced and becomes strongly\ndependent on the length of the chain.

Our theoretical framework is based on a\ntwo-component self-assembled Ising model in which the bidispersity is\nparameterized in terms of the strengths of the binding free energies that\ndepend on the monomer species involved in the pairing interaction. Depending\nupon the relative values of the binding free energies involved, different\nmorphologies of assemblies that include both components are formed, exhibiting\nparamagnetic-, ferromagnetic- or anti ferromagnetic-like order,i.e., random,\nblocky or alternating ordering of the two components in the assemblies.\nAnalyzing the model for the case of ferromagnetic ordering, which is of most\npractical interest, we find that the transition from conditions of minimal\nassembly to those characterized by strong polymerization can be described by a\ncritical concentration that depends on the concentration ratio of the two\nspecies. Interestingly, the distribution of monomers in the assemblies is\ndifferent from that in the original distribution, i.e., the ratio of the\nconcentrations of the two components put into the system. The monomers with a\nsmaller binding free energy are more abundant in short assemblies and monomers\nwith a larger binding affinity are more abundant in longer assemblies.

Under this assumption, the signal can be decomposed into\na small number of wavelets with constant frequency. This justifies the use of a\nfamily of sine-Gaussian templates in the Omega pipeline, one of the algorithms\nused in LIGO-Virgo burst searches. However there are plausible scenarios where\nthe burst frequency evolves rapidly, such as in the merger phase of a binary\nblack hole and/or neutron star coalescence. In those cases, the local\nstationarity of sine-Gaussians induces performance losses, due to the mismatch\nbetween the template and the actual signal. We propose an extension of the\nOmega pipeline based on chirplet-like templates. Chirplets incorporate an\nadditional parameter, the chirp rate, to control the frequency variation. In\nthis paper, we show that the Omega pipeline can easily be extended to include a\nchirplet template bank. We illustrate the method on a simulated data set, with\na family of phenomenological binary black-hole coalescence waveforms embedded\ninto Gaussian LIGO/Virgo-like noise. Chirplet-like templates result in an\nenhancement of the measured signal-to-noise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 16:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2010 09:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
