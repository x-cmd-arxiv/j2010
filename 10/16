The polystyrene particles, of 7 {\\mu}m diameter\nand volume fraction of 8.4%, are carefully made neutrally buoyant with the\nsuspending liquid composed of a mixture of water and a small fraction of\nglycerol. The channel depth is 60 {\\mu}m and the typical length of the\nobstacles normal to the flow direction is 200 {\\mu}m. The flow rate is varied\nto generate Reynolds numbers based on the scale of the obstacle in the\napproximate range 60 < Re < 500; the narrow dimension in the depth direction\nsuppresses onset of unsteadiness and vortex shedding, so that the flows studied\nare found to be steady (aside from particle-scale fluctuations). Particles are\nobserved to be depleted in the wake region of the obstacle. In certain cases,\nthe entire wake is clear of particles; in other cases there is a portion of the\nwake in which particles recirculate while a portion of the wake is completely\ndevoid of particles. Experimental observations reveal that if particles are\nforced into an initially particle-depleted region, they will eventually leave\nand will bring the wake to its original state, implying these are steady-state\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 16:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-18"}

We also show that an almost complete suppression\nof dipolar relaxation is obtained below a magnetic field threshold set by the\ndepth of the lattice: 1D quantum gases in an excited Zeeman state then become\nmetastable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 18:39:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 10:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

If also true for\nlow-energy cosmic rays, the ionization rate near a supernova remnant should be\nhigher than in the general Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We have searched\nfor H3+ absorption features in 6 sight lines which pass through molecular\nmaterial near IC 443---a well-studied case of a supernova remnant interacting\nwith its surrounding molecular material---for the purpose of inferring the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate in the region. In 2 of the sight lines (toward ALS\n8828 and HD 254577) we find large H3+ column densities, N(H3+)~3*10^14 cm^-2,\nand deduce ionization rates of zeta_2~2*10^-15 s^-1, about 5 times larger than\ninferred toward average diffuse molecular cloud sight lines. However, the 3\nsigma upper limits found for the other 4 sight lines are consistent with\ntypical Galactic values. This wide range of ionization rates is likely the\nresult of particle acceleration and propagation effects, which predict that the\ncosmic-ray spectrum and thus ionization rate should vary in and around the\nremnant. While we cannot determine if the H3+ absorption arises in post-shock\n(interior) or pre-shock (exterior) gas, the large inferred ionization rates\nsuggest that IC 443 is in fact accelerating a large population of low-energy\ncosmic rays. Still, it is unclear whether this population can propagate far\nenough into the ISM to account for the ionization rate inferred in diffuse\nGalactic sight lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 19:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The molecular mechanisms\nfor self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency and lineage specification are\npoorly understood, but recent results point to a key role for epigenetic\nmechanisms. In this study, we focus on quantifying the impact of histone 3\nacetylation (H3K9,14ac) on gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells. We\nanalyze genome-wide histone acetylation patterns and gene expression profiles\nmeasured over the first five days of cell differentiation triggered by\nsilencing Nanog, a key transcription factor in ESC regulation. We explore the\ntemporal and spatial dynamics of histone acetylation data and its correlation\nwith gene expression using supervised and unsupervised statistical models. On a\ngenome-wide scale, changes in acetylation are significantly correlated to\nchanges in mRNA expression and, surprisingly, this coherence increases over\ntime. We quantify the predictive power of histone acetylation for gene\nexpression changes in a balanced cross-validation procedure. In an in-depth\nstudy we focus on genes central to the regulatory network of Mouse ESC,\nincluding those identified in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen and in the\nPluriNet, a computationally derived stem cell signature. We find that compared\nto the rest of the genome, ESC-specific genes show significantly more\nacetylation signal and a much stronger decrease in acetylation over time, which\nis often not reflected in an concordant expression change.

One of such misconceptions\nis related to arithmetic of natural numbers, which is extremely important both\nfor science and everyday life. People think their counting is governed by the\nrules of the conventional arithmetic and thus other kinds of arithmetics of\nnatural numbers do not exist and cannot exist. However, this popular image of\nthe situation with the natural numbers is wrong. In many situations, people\nhave to utilize and do implicitly utilize rules of counting and operating\ndifferent from rules and operations in the conventional arithmetic. This is a\nconsequence of the existing diversity in nature and society. To correctly\nrepresent this diversity, people have to explicitly employ different\narithmetics. To make a distinction, we call the conventional arithmetic by the\nname Diophantine arithmetic, while other arithmetics are called\nnon-Diophantine. There are two big families of non-Diophantine arithmetics:\nprojective arithmetics and dual arithmetics (Burgin, 1997).

Our main results are: (i) In the naive factorization approach, the\ndecays such as $B^-\\to \\bar K_2^{*0}\\pi^-$ and $\\bar B^0\\to K_2^{*-}\\pi^+$ with\na tensor meson emitted are prohibited owing to the fact that a tensor meson\ncannot be created from the local V-A or tensor current.

(ii) For\npenguin-dominated $B\\to TP$ and $TV$ decays, the predicted rates in naive\nfactorization are usually too small by one to two orders of magnitude.

This method has the advantage of allowing the use of different\nSkyrme forces, giving different barriers. Thus, for a given reaction, we could\nchoose a Skyrme force with proper barrier characteristics, not-requiring extra\n``barrier lowering\" or ``barrier narrowing\" for a best fit to data. For the\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{100}$Mo reaction, the $\\ell$-summed Wong formula, with effects of\ndeformations and orientations of nuclei included, fits the fusion-evaporation\ncross section data exactly for the force GSkI, requiring additional barrier\nmodifications for forces SIII and SV. However, the same for other similar\nreactions, like $^{58,64}$Ni+$^{58,64}$Ni, fits the data best for SIII force.\nHence, the barrier modification effects in $\\ell$-summed Wong expression\ndepends on the choice of Skyrme force in extended ETF method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2010 05:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

Blind source separation aims at disentangling such mixtures with the\nleast possible prior information on the sources and their mixing processes.\nSeveral powerful approaches have recently been developed, which can often\nprovide new or deeper insight into the underlying physics. This tutorial paper\nbriefly discusses some possible applications of blind source separation to the\nfield of plasma physics, in which this concept is still barely known. Two\nexamples are given.

It appears that almost all animals that use\njet propulsion swim at Reynolds numbers (Re) of about 5 or more. Juvenile squid\nand octopods hatch from the egg already swimming in this inertial regime. The\nlimitations of jet propulsion at intermediate Re is explored here using the\nimmersed boundary method to solve the two-dimensional Navier Stokes equations\ncoupled to the motion of a simplified jellyfish. The contraction and expansion\nkinematics are prescribed, but the forward and backward swimming motions of the\nidealized jellyfish are emergent properties determined by the resulting fluid\ndynamics. Simulations are performed for both an oblate bell shape using a\npaddling mode of swimming and a prolate bell shape using jet propulsion.\nAverage forward velocities and work put into the system are calculated for\nReynolds numbers between 1 and 320.

Similarly,\nthe work required to generate the pulsing motion increases significantly for Re\n< 10.

The introns are estimated to be nearly 95% of the DNA and\nsince they do not seem to participate in the process of transcription of\namino-acids, they have been termed \"junk DNA.\" Although it is believed that the\nnon-coding regions in genomes have no role in cell growth and evolution,\ndemonstration that these regions carry useful information would tend to falsify\nthis belief. In this paper, we consider entropy as a measure of information by\nmodifying the entropy expression to take into account the varying length of\nthese sequences. Exons are usually much shorter in length than introns;\ntherefore the comparison of the entropy values needs to be normalized. A length\ncorrection strategy was employed using randomly generated nucleonic base\nstrings built out of the alphabet of the same size as the exons under question.\nOur analysis shows that introns carry nearly as much of information as exons,\ndisproving the notion that they do not carry any information. The entropy\nfindings of this paper are likely to be of use in further study of other\nchallenging works like the analysis of symmetry models of the genetic code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 22:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}

The inherent difficulty in\ndispersing spores by wind is that spores easily carried by wind are also\nrapidly decelerated when moving through still air. Thus the height of spore\nrelease is critical in determining their range of dispersal. Vascular plants\nwith wind dispersed spores use the height of the plant to lift spores into\nsufficient wind currents for dispersal, however non-vascular plants such as\nSphagnum cannot grow sufficiently tall. These fluid dynamics videos show how\nexploding capsules of {\\em Sphagnum} moss generate vortex rings to carry spores\nto heights above 10 cm with an initial velocity of 16 m s$^{-1}$. In contrast\nspores launched ballistically at these speeds through still air would travel\nonly 2-7 mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 19:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}
