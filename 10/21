This is possible because in three-flavor quark\nmatter with instanton effects a chiral condensate can be added to the\ncolor-flavor locked (CFL) phase without changing the symmetries of the ground\nstate. In (massless) two-flavor quark matter such a critical point is not\npossible since the corresponding color superconductor (2SC) does not break\nchiral symmetry. We study the effects of a nonzero but finite strange quark\nmass which interpolates between these two cases. Since at ultra-high density\nthe first reaction of CFL to a nonzero strange quark mass is to develop a kaon\ncondensate, we extend previous Ginzburg-Landau studies by including such a\ncondensate.

We investigate a model that takes into account\nthe relative velocity (hereafter the tilted velocity) between the two frames,\nand develop a Bayesian statistic to explore the likelihood of this tilted\nvelocity.\n  By studying various independent peculiar velocity catalogs, we find that: (1)\nthe magnitude of the tilted velocity $u$ is around 400 km/s, and its direction\nis close to what is found from previous bulk flow analyses; for most catalogs\nanalysed, u=0 is excluded at about the $2.5 \\sigma$ level;(2) constraints on\nthe magnitude of the tilted velocity can result in constraints on the duration\nof inflation, due to the fact that inflation can neither be too long (no dipole\neffect) nor too short (very large dipole effect); (3) Under the assumption of a\nsuper-horizon isocurvature fluctuation, the constraints on the tilted velocity\nrequire that inflation lasts at least 6 e-folds longer (at the 95% confidence\ninterval) than that required to solve the horizon problem. This opens a new\nwindow for testing inflation and models of the early Universe from observations\nof large scale structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 18:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 19:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 01:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 12:31:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2011 20:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

Five\nobservations are analyzed that span the polar coronal hole from the central\nmeridian to the boundary with the quiet Sun corona. We study the observations\nabove the solar limb in the height range of 1.03 - 1.20 solar radii. The\nelectron temperature Te and emission measure EM are found using the Geometric\nmean Emission Measure (GEM) method. The EM derived from the elements Fe, Si, S,\nand Al are compared in order to measure relative coronal-to-photospheric\nabundance enhancement factors. We also studied the ion temperature Ti and the\nnon-thermal velocity Vnt using the line profiles. All these measurements are\ncompared to polar coronal hole observations from the previous (1996-1997) solar\nminimum and to model predictions for relative abundances. There are many\nsimilarities in the physical properties of the polar coronal holes between the\ntwo minima at these low heights. We find that Te, electron density Ne, and Ti\nare comparable in both minima. Te shows a comparable gradient with height. Both\nminima show a decreasing Ti with increasing charge-to-mass ratio q/M. A\npreviously observed upturn of Ti for ions above q/M > 0.25 was not found here.\nWe also compared relative coronal-to-photospheric elemental abundance\nenhancement factors for a number of elements. These ratios were about 1 for\nboth the low first ionization potential (FIP) elements Si and Al and the\nmarginally high FIP element S relative to the low FIP element Fe, as is\nexpected based on earlier observations and models for a polar coronal hole.\nThese results are consistent with no FIP effect in a polar coronal hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 19:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This structure\nappears in several algebraic setups (dual braid monoid, cluster algebras...).\nMany combinatorial properties of NCP_W are proved case-by-case, using the\nclassification of reflection groups. It is the case for Chapoton's formula,\nexpressing the number of multichains of a given length in the lattice NCP_W, in\nterms of the invariant degrees of W. This thesis work is motivated by the\nsearch for a geometric explanation of this formula, which could lead to a\nuniform understanding of the connections between the combinatorics of NCP_W and\nthe invariant theory of W.\n  The starting point is to use the Lyashko-Looijenga covering (LL), based on\nthe geometry of the discriminant of W. In the first chapter, some topological\nconstructions of Bessis are refined, allowing to relate the fibers of LL with\nblock factorisations of a Coxeter element.

Given\na set of resolved variables that define a model reduction, the\nquasi-equilibrium ensembles associated with the resolved variables are employed\nas a family of trial probability densities on phase space. The residual that\nresults from submitting these trial densities to the Liouville equation is\nquantified by an ensemble-averaged cost function related to the information\nloss rate of the reduction. From an initial nonequilibrium state, the\nstatistical state of the system at any later time is estimated by minimizing\nthe time integral of the cost function over paths of trial densities.\nStatistical closure of the underresolved dynamics is obtained at the level of\nthe value function, which equals the optimal cost of reduction with respect to\nthe resolved variables, and the evolution of the estimated statistical state is\ndeduced from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation satisfied by the value function. In\nthe near-equilibrium regime, or under a local quadratic approximation in the\nfar-from-equilibrium regime, this best-fit closure is governed by a\ndifferential equation for the estimated state vector coupled to a Riccati\ndifferential equation for the Hessian matrix of the value function. Since\nmemory effects are not explicitly included in the trial densities, a single\nadjustable parameter is introduced into the cost function to capture a\ntime-scale ratio between resolved and unresolved motions.

Due to the repulsive interaction between the\ntwo species, the system exhibits phase separation. First, in the extreme limit\nof the zero-hopping case, we derive analytical expressions for the phase\nboundaries. In particular, we derive the conditions for phase separation in the\nMott insulator phase. We find that the conditions for the phase separation\ndepend on the on-site interactions as well as the occupation numbers. In\nparticular, we show that the coexisting state appears by varying the on-site\ninter-species interaction. We also show the phase diagram of the finite hopping\ncase. Second, we calculate the spatial density profile of $^{87}$Rb-$^{41}$K\nmixtures in the combined potential of a parabolic trap and an optical lattice\nusing the local density approximation. We fixed the number of $^{87}$Rb and\nvaried the number of $^{41}$K, and used the parameters estimated by\nexperiments.

Therefore, the continuity and the geometric conservation equations\ntake very simple form similar to those of the Cartesian coordinates. The\ncontinuity equation is satisfied exactly within each element and a special\nattention is given to satisfy the geometric conservation law (GCL) at the\ndiscrete level. The equation of motion of a deforming body is solved in\naddition to the Navier-Stokes equations in a fully-coupled form. The mesh\ndeformation is achieved by solving the linear elasticity equation at each time\nlevel while avoiding remeshing in order to enhance numerical robustness.

The models successfully reproduce\nobserved continuum and polarization all-sky maps and the distribution of\nrotation measures of extragalactic sources across the sky. However, the model\nparameters obtained for the Galactic halo, although reproducing the\nobservations, seem physically unreasonable: the magnetic field needs to be\nsignificantly stronger in the Galactic halo than in the plane and the\ncosmic-ray distribution must be truncated at about 1 kpc to avoid excessive\nsynchrotron emission from the halo. The reason for these unrealistic parameters\nwas the low scale-height of the warm thermal gas of about 1 kpc adapted in the\nNE2001 model. However, this scale-height seemed well settled by numerous\ninvestigations. Recently, the scale-height of the warm gas in the Galaxy was\nrevised by Gaensler et al. (2008) to about 1.8 kpc, by showing that the 1 kpc\nscale-height results from a systematic bias in the analysis of pulsar data.\nThis implies a higher thermal electron density in the Galactic halo, which in\nturn reduces the halo magnetic field strength to account for the observed\nrotation measures of extragalactic sources. We slightly modified the NE2001\nmodel for the new scale-height and revised the Sun et al. (2008) model\nparameters accordingly: the strength of the regular halo magnetic field is now\n2 microG or lower, and the physically unrealistic cutoff in z for the\ncosmic-ray electron density is removed.

Reliably inferring the properties of galactic nuclei and disks\nrequires detailed studies of sources whose structure is spatially resolved. We\ncompare the spatial distributions and abundance ratios of HCN, HCO+, and HNC in\nW49A, the most massive and luminous star-forming region in the Galactic disk,\nbased on maps of a 2' (6.6 pc) field at 14\" (0.83 pc) resolution of the J=4-3\ntransitions of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HCO+, H13CO+, HC18O+ and HNC. The kinematics\nof the molecular gas in W49A appears complex, with a mixture of infall and\noutflow motions. Both the line profiles and comparison of the main and rarer\nspecies show that the main species are optically thick. Two 'clumps' of\ninfalling gas appear to be at ~40 K, compared to ~100 K at the source centre,\nand may be ~10x denser than the rest of the outer cloud. Chemical modelling\nsuggests that the HCN/HNC ratio probes the current gas temperature, while the\nHCN/HCO+ ratio and the deuterium fractionation were set during an earlier,\ncolder phase of evolution. The data suggest that W49A is an appropriate\nanalogue of an extragalactic star forming region. Our data show that the use of\nHCN/HNC/HCO+ line ratios as proxies for the abundance ratios is incorrect for\nW49A, suggesting the same for galactic nuclei. Our observed isotopic line\nratios such as H13CN/H13CO+ approach our modeled abundance ratios quite well in\nW49A. The 4-3 lines of HCN and HCO+ are much better tracers of the dense\nstar-forming gas in W49A than the 1-0 lines. Our observed HCN/HNC and HCN/HCO+\nratios in W49A are inconsistent with homogeneous PDR or XDR models, indicating\nthat irradiation hardly affects the gas chemistry in W49A. Overall, the W49A\nregion appears to be a useful template for starburst galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 11:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Each galaxy was separated into regions of\nincreasingly red near-infrared colors. In the absence of dust extinction and\nother non-stellar emission, stellar populations are shown to have relatively\nconstant NIR colors, independent of age. In regions of high star formation, the\naverage intensity of pixels in red-excess regions (at 1.25, 3.6, 4.5, 5.6, 8.0\nand 24 micron) scales linearly with the intrinsic intensity of Halpha emission,\nand thus with the star-formation rate within the pixel. This suggests that most\nNIR-excess regions are not red because their light is being depleted by\nabsorption. Instead, they are red because additional infrared light is being\ncontributed by a process linked to star-formation. This is surprising because\nthe shorter wavelength bands in our study (1.25 micron-5.6 micron) do not probe\nemission from cold (10-20 K) and warm (50-100 K) dust associated with\nstar-formation in molecular clouds. However, emission from hot dust (700-1000\nK) and/or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules can explain the additional\nemission seen at the shorter wavelengths in our study. The contribution from\nhot dust and/or PAH emission at 2-5micron and PAH emission at 5.6 and 8.0\nmicron scales linearly with warm dust emission at 24 micron and the intrinsic\nHalpha emission. Since both are tied to the star-formation rate, our analysis\nshows that the NIR excess continuum emission and PAH emission at ~1-8 micron\ncan be added to spectral energy distribution models in a very straight-forward\nway, by simply adding an additional component to the models that scales\nlinearly with star-formation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 12:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Credible models of the correlations in\nlongitudinal imaging require two or more pattern components. Valid inference\nrequires enough flexibility of the correlation model to allow reasonable\nfidelity to the true pattern. On the other hand, the existence of computable\nestimates demands a parsimonious parameterization of the correlation structure.\nFor many one-dimensional spatial or temporal arrays, the linear exponent\nautoregressive (LEAR) correlation structure meets these two opposing goals in\none model. The LEAR structure is a flexible two-parameter correlation model\nthat applies in situations in which the within-subject correlation decreases\nexponentially in time or space.

Optimal properties and an excellent correlation are\nfound for a linear combination of the eddy-viscosity closure that is employed\nin LES of weakly compressible turbulence and a term that is non-linear in the\nJacobian matrix of the velocity. Using this mixed closure, the SGS turbulence\nenergy model is validated in LES of turbulence with stochastic forcing. It is\nfound that the SGS model satisfies several important requirements: 1.

The\npossibilities when the overall Lagrangian represents a sum or difference of two\nidentical Lagrangians for the visible and hidden sectors (i.e. copies of\nunbroken) are ruled out by the extended symmetry. The distinction between the\ntwo types of fields resides in the fact that for one of them current and\nelectromagnetic kinetic terms in Lagrangians are identical in sign, whereas for\nanother type these terms are opposite in sign.

While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of agents\nwithin robotics or software applications, we propose a novel usage model for\nself-organizing agents suited to wireless networks. In the proposed model, a\nnumber of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located\ntasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and\nsubsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The\nproblem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and\nthe tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed\ncoalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents which\nmove between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit\nthe packets. Within each coalition, some agents can also take the role of a\nrelay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed\nalgorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join\nor leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective\nthroughput, and the cost in terms of delay. As a result of these decisions, the\nagents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions\nwhich constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed\nalgorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental\nchanges such as the arrival/removal of tasks or the mobility of the tasks.\nSimulation results show how the proposed algorithm improves the performance, in\nterms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26% (for a\nnetwork of 5 agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates\nnearby tasks equally among agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 15:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In this paper, we study the impact of this tradeoff on the\nnetwork structure and the cooperative incentives of the SUs that seek to\ncooperate for improving their detection performance. We model the CSS problem\nas a non-transferable coalitional game, and we propose distributed algorithms\nfor coalition formation.

Then, the CF algorithm is complemented\nwith a coalitional voting game for enabling distributed coalition formation\nwith detection probability guarantees (CF-PD) when required by the PU. The\nCF-PD algorithm allows the SUs to form minimal winning coalitions (MWCs), i.e.,\ncoalitions that achieve the target detection probability with minimal costs.\nFor both algorithms, we study and prove various properties pertaining to\nnetwork structure, adaptation to mobility and stability. Simulation results\nshow that CF reduces the average probability of miss per SU up to 88.45%\nrelative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a desired false alarm.\nFor CF-PD, the results show that up to 87.25% of the SUs achieve the required\ndetection probability through MWC\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 15:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
