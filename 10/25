In the second time slot,\neach relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and\nretransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a collaborative\ntwo-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding,\neach receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the \"self-interference\" in the received\nsignal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the\n2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with\ncollaborative beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity\nbetween the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region\nis characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we\ninvestigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a\nsum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal\nbeamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR\nminimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the\ncorresponding achievable rate region.

This approach to mobile computing and\ncommunication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent infrastructure\nis available. There are many situations where these requirements are not\nfulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and\nmilitary conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile\ndevices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a\nMobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired\nnetworks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the\nwireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of\ncentral administration security issues are different from conventional\nnetworks. For the purposes of this article we have used the \"WMN test-bed\" to\nenable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven\nway of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are\nnot as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is\ndetrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic\napproaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to\nprovide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of\nperformance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing\nschemes. Our findings clearly show that the most efficient combination of\nalgorithms used for authentication and encryption are SHA-1 and AES\nrespectively. Using this combination over their counterparts will lead to a\nconsiderable reduction in processing time and delay on the network, creating an\nefficient transaction moving towards satisfying resource constraints and\nsecurity requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 18:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-13"}

With higher density and more interactions\nat high redshift DLAs are larger in both absolute terms and in relative terms\nwith respect to virial radii of halos.

This paper\nproposes a new model called Dynamic Multi-Layer Signature based IDS using\nMobile Agents, which can detect imminent threats with very high success rate by\ndynamically and automatically creating and using small and efficient multiple\ndatabases, and at the same time, provide mechanism to update these small\nsignature databases at regular intervals using Mobile Agents\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 04:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

With the rapid increase in the capacity and size of\ndata centers, there is a continuous increase in the demand for energy\nconsumption. These data centers not only consume a tremendous amount of energy\nbut are riddled with IT inefficiencies. All data center are plagued with\nthousands of servers as major components. These servers consume huge energy\nwithout performing useful work. In an average server environment, 30% of the\nservers are \"dead\" only consuming energy, without being properly utilized.\nTheir utilization ratio is only 5 to 10 percent. This paper focuses on the use\nof an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient\ndata centers by providing a solution called server consolidation. It increases\nthe utilization ratio up to 50% saving huge amount of energy. Server\nconsolidation helps in implementing green data centers to ensure that IT\ninfrastructure contributes as little as possible to the emission of green house\ngases, and helps to regain power and cooling capacity, recapture resilience and\ndramatically reducing energy costs and total cost of ownership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 04:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

In particular\nimproved momentum and energy resolution as well as the use of photon energies\nfrom few eV up to several keV makes ARPES a rather unique tool to investigate\nthe electronic properties of solids and surfaces. Obviously, this rises the\nneed for a corresponding theoretical formalism that allows to accompany\nexperimental ARPES studies in an adequate way. As will be demonstrated by\nseveral examples this goal could be achieved by various recent developments on\nthe basis of the one-step model of photo emission: The spin-orbit induced\nRashba-splitting of Shockley-type surface states is discussed using a fully\nrelativistic description. The impact of chemical disorder within surface layers\ncan be handled by means of the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) alloy\ntheory. Calculating phonon properties together with the corresponding\nelectron-phonon self-energy allows a direct comparison with features in the\nARPES spectra caused by electron-phonon interaction. The same holds for the\ninfluence of electronic correlation effects. These are accounted for by means\nof the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) that removes the most serious short\ncomings of standard calculations based on the standard LDA. The combination of\nthis approach with the CPA allows the investigation of correlated transition\nmetal alloys. Finally, accounting for the photon momentum and going beyond the\nsingle scatter approximation for the final state allows to deal quantitatively\nwith ARPES in the HAXPES regime that reduces the influence of the surface on\nthe spectra and probing primarily the bulk electronic structure this way.\nCorresponding calculations of ARPES spectra, however, have to deal with thermal\nvibrations in an adequate way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 10:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

In\nthis paper we attempt to address both the sense and the sensitivity of such\nproposals. Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and\nunambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana\nneutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental\napproaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing\nthe resulting sensitivities. We also propose a \"physics-motivated range\" (PMR)\nof the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different\nnuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in\nterms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,\nisotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass. For each\nproposal, both a reference and an optimistic scenario for the experimental\nperformance are studied. In the reference scenario we find that all the\nproposals will be able to partially explore the degenerate spectrum, without\nfully covering it, although four of them (KamLAND-Zen, CUORE, NEXT and EXO)\nwill approach the 50 meV boundary. In the optimistic scenario, we find that\nCUORE and the xenon-based proposals (KamLAND-Zen, EXO and NEXT) will explore a\nsignificant fraction of the inverse hierarchy, with NEXT covering it almost\nfully. For the long term future, we argue that Xe-based experiments may provide\nthe best case for a 1-ton scale experiment, given the potentially very low\nbackgrounds achievable and the expected scalability to large isotope masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 13:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 15:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 18:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2011 10:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}

A typical pattern is that as the\norbit becomes more precisely determined, impact probability often increases\ninitially, but then turns around and decreases until it falls to zero, or some\nvery low number.\n  In the present study we define a probability measure which provides a simple\ntool to evaluate from the very beginning the chance that the impact probability\ncalculated by monitoring systems for a threatening object will reach unity at\nthe end of the overall process of orbit refinement. We stress that this chance\nis independent of the specific (fluctuating) value of the probability\ncalculated by the monitoring systems.

A basic initial feature is that AP\nTheory, as a whole, is already, ab initio, a universal canonical 2D\nsigma-model, targeting smooth, compact, simply-connected 4-manifolds with a\nconnected boundary, and its topological Planckian quantum starting point, as\nwell as its cone-like, infinitely-generated at each stage, graded group of\nhomology-preserving, but topology-changing transitions/interactions, exhibit\nthe most general qualitative S-duality.

The latter\nhave to exist since AP Theory deals, a priori, essentially only with discrete\ngroup-theoretic presentation theory, not Lie group representation theory, not\nwith category nor moduli theory, does not need classical SUSY, nor Feynman\nintegrals, lattice models, etc., and furthermore is model-independent and\ncharacteristic of real dimension four.

The system is defined on a square lattice and\nthe spins interact via isotropic Heisenberg interactions such that all\nnearest-neighbour (NN) exchange bonds are present with identical strength\n$J_{1}>0$, and only half of the next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) exchange bonds are\npresent with identical strength $J_{2} \\equiv \\kappa J_{1} > 0$.

Here we study the long-wavelength plasmon dispersion\nand the Drude weight of archetypical spin-orbit-coupled 2DEGs. We first show\nthat these measurable quantities are sensitive to electron-electron\ninteractions due to broken Galileian invariance and then discuss in detail why\nthe popular random phase approximation is not capable of describing the\ncollective dynamics of these systems even at very long wavelengths. This work\nis focussed on presenting approximate microscopic calculations of these\nquantities based on the minimal theoretical scheme that captures the basic\nphysics correctly, i.e. the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation. We find\nthat interactions enhance the \"plasmon mass\" and suppress the Drude weight. Our\nfindings can be tested by inelastic light scattering, electron energy loss, and\nfar-infrared optical-absorption measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 15:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-19"}

We describe and test an iterative\nmethod developed within the framework of a probabilistic approach to the\nspectral inverse problem for determining the thermal structures of the emitting\nplasma. We also demonstrate applications of this method to both high resolution\nline spectra and broadband imaging data. Our so-called Bayesian iterative\nmethod (BIM) is an iterative procedure based on Bayes' theorem and is used to\nreconstruct differential emission measure (DEM) distributions. To demonstrate\nthe abilities of the BIM, we performed various numerical tests and model\nsimulations establishing its robustness and usefulness. We then applied the BIM\nto observable data for several active regions (AR) previously analyzed with\nother DEM diagnostic techniques: both SUMER/SOHO (Landi and Feldman, 2008) and\nSPIRIT/CORONAS-F (Shestov et al., 2010) line spectra data, and XRT/Hinode\n(Reale et al., 2009) broadband imaging data. The BIM results show that this\nmethod is an effective tool for determining the thermal structure of emitting\nplasma and can be successfully used for the DEM analysis of both line spectra\nand broadband imaging data. The BIM calculations correlate with recent studies\nconfirming the existence of hot plasma in solar ARs. The BIM results also\nindicate that the coronal plasma may have the continuous distributions\npredicted by the nanoflare paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 15:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}
