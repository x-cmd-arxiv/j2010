Unlike traditional economic models,\ncivilization is viewed only as a well-mixed global whole with no distinction\nmade between individual nations, economic sectors, labor, or capital\ninvestments. At the model core is an observationally supported hypothesis that\nthe global economy's current rate of primary energy consumption is tied through\na constant to a very general representation of its historically accumulated\nwealth. Here, this growth model is coupled to a linear formulation for the\nevolution of globally well-mixed atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While very\nsimple, the coupled model provides faithful multi-decadal hindcasts of\ntrajectories in gross world product (GWP) and CO2. Extending the model to the\nfuture, the model suggests that the well-known IPCC SRES scenarios\nsubstantially underestimate how much CO2 levels will rise for a given level of\nfuture economic prosperity. For one, global CO2 emission rates cannot be\ndecoupled from wealth through efficiency gains. For another, like a long-term\nnatural disaster, future greenhouse warming can be expected to act as an\ninflationary drag on the real growth of global wealth. For atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations to remain below a \"dangerous\" level of 450 ppmv, model forecasts\nsuggest that there will have to be some combination of an unrealistically rapid\nrate of energy decarbonization and nearly immediate reductions in global\ncivilization wealth. Effectively, it appears that civilization may be in a\ndouble-bind. If civilization does not collapse quickly this century, then CO2\nlevels will likely end up exceeding 1000 ppmv; but, if CO2 levels rise by this\nmuch, then the risk is that civilization will gradually tend towards collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2010 18:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2011 00:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 17:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It has been found that, as the temperature lowers,\nthe NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities.\nThe fact that the size of the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of\nthe NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of\nthese overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and\npercolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping\nx_{c1}, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive\nelectric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a\nsingle hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At\nthe second critical doping x_{c2}, when the superconductivity disappears, our\nanalysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of\nx_{c2} can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions\nin NRs, whose concentration appearing above x_{c1} increases smoothly with the\ndoping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x_{c2}. The last one\nresults in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region,\nwhich explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3].\nSince [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can\nconclude that along this boundary, as well as in x_{c2}, all bosons disappear.\nAs justification of appearance of single bosons, the bosonization of 2D\nfermions is rigorously proven using the concept of anyons.

We\nintroduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a\nstatistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility.\nThe model not only accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws but also\nallows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2010 19:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This makes the relation between\nthe observed shear, the intrinsic shear and lensing distortion more simple and\nthus higher-order calculation more easy. The elliptical weight function allows\nus to measure the mutiplemoment of shape of background galaxies more precisely\nby weighting highly to brighter parts of image and moreover to reduce\nsystematic error due to insufficient expansion of the weight function in the\noriginal approach of KSB. Point Spread Function(PSF) correction in E-HOLICs\nmethods becomes more complicated than those in KSB methods. In this paper we\nstudied isotropic PSF correction in detail.

The oxidation was performed in the temperature range 1000C to\n1200C for samples with nitrogen doping in the range of 6.5e15/cm3 to\n9.3e18/cm3, showing a clear doping dependence. Samples with higher doping\nconcentrations displayed higher oxidation rates. The results were interpreted\nusing a modified Deal-Grove model. Linear and parabolic rate constants and\nactivation energies were extracted. Increasing nitrogen led to an increase in\nlinear rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10-6m/s to 10-2m/s and the\nparabolic rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10e9m2/s to 10e6m2/s. The\nincrease in linear rate constant was attributed to defects from doping-induced\nlattice mismatch, which tend to be more reactive than bulk crystal regions. The\nincrease in the diffusion-limited parabolic rate constant was attributed to\ndegradation in oxide quality originating from the doping-induced lattice\nmismatch. This degradation was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in\noptical density of the grown oxide films from 1.4 to 1.24. The linear\nactivation energy varied from 1.6eV to 2.8eV, while the parabolic activation\nenergy varied from 2.7eV to 3.3eV, increasing with doping concentration. These\nincreased activation energies were attributed to higher nitrogen content,\nleading to an increase in effective bond energy stemming from the difference in\nC-Si (2.82eV) and Si-N (4.26eV) binding energies. This work provides crucial\ninformation in the engineering of SiO2 dielectrics for SiC MOS structures,\nwhich typically involve regions of very different doping concentrations, and\nsuggests that thermal oxidation at high doping concentrations in SiC may be\ndefect mediated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 04:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However, the theorem\nis not applicable to the system under finite current since it is not in\nequilibrium. To examine the effect of finite current on the thermal\nfluctuation, we adopt the influence functional formalism developed by Feynman\nand Vernon, which is known to be a useful tool to analyze effects of\ndissipation and thermal fluctuation. For this purpose, we construct a quantum\nmechanical effective Hamiltonian describing current-induced domain wall motion\nby generalizing the Caldeira-Leggett description of quantum dissipation.

The insertable mirrors\npair can separate spatially the X-ray beams generated in the first and in the\nsecond half of the baseline undulator. Rapid switching of the FEL amplification\nprocess allows deactivating one half and activating another half of the\nundulator. As proposed elsewhere, using a kicker installed upstream of the LCLS\nbaseline undulator and an already existing corrector in the first half of the\nundulator, it is possible to rapidly switch the X-ray beam from one user to\nanother.

However, challenges arise when the censoring time\nis not always observed and may be covariate-dependent, particularly in the\npresence of continuously-distributed covariates. In spite of several recent\nadvances, existing methods either involve algorithmic complications or impose a\nprobability grid. The former leads to difficulties in the implementation and\nasymptotics, whereas the latter introduces undesirable grid dependence. To\nresolve these issues, we develop fundamental and general quantile calculus on\ncumulative probability scale in this article, upon recognizing that probability\nand time scales do not always have a one-to-one mapping given a survival\ndistribution. These results give rise to a novel estimation procedure for\ncensored quantile regression, based on estimating integral equations. A\nnumerically reliable and efficient Progressive Localized Minimization (PLMIN)\nalgorithm is proposed for the computation. This procedure reduces exactly to\nthe Kaplan--Meier method in the $k$-sample problem, and to standard uncensored\nquantile regression in the absence of censoring. Under regularity conditions,\nthe proposed quantile coefficient estimator is uniformly consistent and\nconverges weakly to a Gaussian process. Simulations show good statistical and\nalgorithmic performance. The proposal is illustrated in the application to a\nclinical study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 09:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

Local electronic structures around\nthe impurity are quantitatively characterized by their onsite potential and\ntransfer hoppings to neighboring sites. We found that the impurities are\nclassified into three groups according to the derived parameters: For Mn, Co,\nand Ni, their impurity-3d levels measured from the Fe-3d level are nearly 0.3\neV, -0.3 eV, and -0.8 eV, respectively, while, for the Zn case, the d level is\nconsiderably deep as -8 eV. For the Ru case, although the onsite-level\ndifference is much smaller as O(0.1) eV, the transfer integrals around the\nimpurity site are larger than those of the pure system by 20% \\sim 30%, due to\nthe large spatial spread of the Ru-4d orbitals. We also show that, while excess\ncarriers are tightly trapped around the impurity site (due to the Friedel sum\nrule), there is a rigid shift of band structure near the Fermi level, which has\nthe same effect as carrier doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 10:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

This problem is\nrelevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well\nknown that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying\nregression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero\ncomponents of this vector can be \"relaxed\" by regularizing the squared error\nwith a convex penalty function like the $\\ell_1$ norm. However, in many\napplications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector\nand its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the\nlearning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In\nthis paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior\nknowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the\nregression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\\ell_1$ norm and is flexible\nenough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical\nand theoretical importance.

The phase space analysis was made\nand the critical points were found, one of which is the attractor corresponding\nto an accelerated expanding Universe.\n  Recent observations of near supernova show that the acceleration of Universe\ndecreases. This phenomenon is called the transient acceleration. In the second\npart of Article we consider the 3-component Universe composed of a scalar\nfield, interacting with the dark matter on the agegraphic dark energy\nbackground. We show that the transient acceleration appears in frame of such a\nmodel. The obtained results agree with the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 12:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 19:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 19:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It is motivated as a tool for video\nsurveillance applications with the background image sequence forming the low\nrank part and the moving objects/persons/abnormalities forming the sparse part.\nEach image frame is treated as a column vector of the data matrix made up of a\nlow rank matrix and a sparse corruption matrix. Principal component pursuit\nsolves the problem under the assumptions that the singular vectors of the low\nrank matrix are spread out and the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix is\nuniformly random. However, in practice, usually the sparsity pattern and the\nsignal values of the sparse part (moving persons/objects) change in a\ncorrelated fashion over time, for e.g., the object moves slowly and/or with\nroughly constant velocity. This will often result in a low rank sparse matrix.\n  For video surveillance applications, it would be much more useful to have a\nreal-time solution. In this work, we study the online version of the above\nproblem and propose a solution that automatically handles correlated sparse\noutliers. The key idea of this work is as follows. Given an initial estimate of\nthe principal directions of the low rank part, we causally keep estimating the\nsparse part at each time by solving a noisy compressive sensing type problem.\nThe principal directions of the low rank part are updated every-so-often. In\nbetween two update times, if new Principal Components' directions appear, the\n\"noise\" seen by the Compressive Sensing step may increase. This problem is\nsolved, in part, by utilizing the time correlation model of the low rank part.\nWe call the proposed solution \"Real-time Robust Principal Components' Pursuit\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 14:50:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 14:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2011 15:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The performance of this scheme strongly depends on\nthe network topology and thus on the locations of the wireless nodes. Also, it\nhas been shown previously that finding the encoding strategy, which achieves\nmaximum performance, requires complex calculations to be undertaken by the\nwireless node in real-time.\n  Both deterministic and random point pattern are explored and using the\nBoolean connectivity model we provide upper bounds for the maximum coding\nnumber, i.e., the number of packets that can be combined such that the\ncorresponding receivers are able to decode. For the models studied, this upper\nbound is of order of $\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ denotes the (mean) number of\nneighbors. Moreover, achievable coding numbers are provided for grid-like\nnetworks. We also calculate the multiplicative constants that determine the\ngain in case of a small network. Building on the above results, we provide an\nanalytic expression for the upper bound of the efficiency of local network\ncoding. The conveyed message is that it is favorable to reduce computational\ncomplexity by relying only on small encoding numbers since the resulting\nexpected throughput loss is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 15:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The solution is\nconformally stationary, axisymmetric, and conformally separable, possessing a\nconformal Killing tensor. Hyper-relativistic counter-streaming between\ncollisionless ingoing and outgoing streams drives inflation at (just above) the\ninner horizon, followed by collapse. As ingoing and outgoing streams approach\nthe inner horizon, they focus into twin narrow beams directed along the ingoing\nand outgoing principal null directions, regardless of the initial angular\nmotions of the streams. The radial energy-momentum of the counter-streaming\nbeams gravitationally accelerates the streams even faster along the principal\ndirections, leading to exponential growth in the streaming density and\npressure, and in the Weyl curvature and mass function. At exponentially large\ndensity and curvature, inflation stalls, and the spacetime collapses. As the\nspacetime collapses, the angular motions of the freely-falling streams grow.\nWhen the angular motion has become comparable to the radial motion, which\nhappens when the conformal factor has shrunk to an exponentially tiny scale,\nconformal separability breaks down, and the solution fails. The condition of\nconformal separability prescribes the form of the ingoing and outgoing\naccretion flows incident on the inner horizon. The dominant radial part of the\nsolution holds provided that the densities of ingoing and outgoing streams\nincident on the inner horizon are uniform, independent of latitude; that is,\nthe accretion flow is \"monopole.\" The sub-dominant angular part of the solution\nrequires a special non-radial pattern of angular motion of streams incident on\nthe inner horizon.
