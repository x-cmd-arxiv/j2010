For any given reaction,\nthe S(E)-model contains four parameters [two of which approximate the barrier\npotential, U(r)]. They are easily interpolated along many reactions involving\nisotopes of the same elements; they give accurate practical expressions for\nS(E) with only several input parameters for many reactions. The model\nreproduces the suppression of S(E) at low energies (of astrophysical\nimportance) due to the shape of the low-r wing of U(r). The model can be used\nto reconstruct U(r) from computed or measured S(E). For illustration, we\nparameterize our recent calculations of S(E) (using the Sao Paulo potential and\nthe barrier penetration formalism) for 946 reactions involving stable and\nunstable isotopes of C, O, Ne, and Mg (with 9 parameters for all reactions\ninvolving many isotopes of the same elements, e.g., C+O).

We give an upper bound on the volume of\nthe symmetric difference of A and f(A) where f is a translation, a rotation, or\nthe composition of both, a rigid motion. The volume is measured by the\nd-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which coincides with the Lebesgue measure for\nLebesgue measurable sets. We bound the volume of the symmetric difference of A\nand f(A) in terms of the (d-1)-dimensional volume of the boundary of A and the\nmaximal distance of a boundary point to its image under f. The boundary is\nmeasured by the (d-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which matches the surface\narea for sufficiently nice sets. In the case of translations, our bound is\nsharp. In the case of rotations, we get a sharp bound under the assumption that\nthe boundary is sufficiently nice. The motivation to study these bounds comes\nfrom shape matching. For two shapes A and B in IR^d and a class of\ntransformations, the matching problem asks for a transformation f such that\nf(A) and B match optimally. The quality of the match is measured by some\nsimilarity measure, for instance the volume of overlap. Let A and B be bounded\nsubsets of IR^d, and let F be the function that maps a rigid motion r to the\nvolume of overlap of r(A) and B. Maximizing this function is a shape matching\nproblem, and knowing that F is Lipschitz continuous helps to solve it. We apply\nour results to bound the difference |F(r) - F(s)| for rigid motions r,s that\nare close, implying that F is Lipschitz continuous for many metrics on the\nspace of rigid motions. Depending on the metric, also a Lipschitz constant can\nbe deduced from the bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 17:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-13"}

For a fiducial 1\nM$_J$ gas giant planet with a remnant isolation phase accretion rate of\n$\\dot{M}_{\\odot} =$ 10$^{-10} M_{\\odot}{\\rm yr}^{-1}=10^{-7}M_{J}{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$, the disk accretion will be truncated at $\\sim 2.7r_J$ (with $r_J$ is\nJupiter's radius) and drive the planet to rotate with a period of $\\sim$7\nhours. Thermal emission from planetary magnetospheric accretion will be\ndifficult to observe; the most promising observational signatures may be\nnon-thermal, such as gyrosynchrotron radiation that is clearly modulated at a\nperiod much shorter than the rotation period of the host star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 18:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Existing automated schemes can successfully\ndistinguish between early and late type galaxies and identify merger\ncandidates, but are inadequate for studying detailed morphologies of red\nsequence galaxies. To fill this need, we present a new automated classification\nscheme that focuses on making finer distinctions between early types roughly\ncorresponding to Hubble types E, S0, and Sa.

We then develop an\nautomated method to closely reproduce the visual classifications, which both\nprovides a check on the visual results and makes it possible to extend\nmorphological analysis to much larger samples. We visually classify the\ngalaxies into three bulge classes (BC) by the shape of the light profile in the\nouter regions: discs have sharp edges and bulges do not, while some galaxies\nare intermediate. We separately identify galaxies with features: spiral arms,\nbars, clumps, rings, and dust. We find general agreement between BC and the\nbulge fraction B/T measured by the galaxy modeling package GIM2D, but many\nvisual discs have B/T>0.5. Three additional automated parameters -- smoothness,\naxis ratio, and concentration -- can identify many of these high-B/T discs to\nyield automated classifications that agree ~70% with the visual classifications\n(>90% within one BC). Both methods are used to study the bulge vs. disc\nfrequency as a function of four measures of galaxy 'size': luminosity, stellar\nmass, velocity dispersion, and radius. All size indicators show a fall in disc\nfraction and a rise in bulge fraction among larger galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 20:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The answer to this question has direct\nimplications for the feasibility of coincident detections of electromagnetic\n(EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescences. Such detections are\nconsidered to be the next observational grand challenge that will enable\ntesting general relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and improve our\nunderstanding of evolution and growth of these massive compact objects. In this\npaper we review the properties of the environment of coalescing binaries in the\ncontext of the circumbinary disk and hot, radiatively inefficient accretion\nflow models and use them to mark the extent of the parameter space spanned by\nthis problem. We report the results from an ongoing, general relativistic,\nhydrodynamical study of the inspiral and merger of black holes, motivated by\nthe latter scenario. We find that correlated EM+GW oscillations can arise\nduring the inspiral phase followed by the gradual rise and subsequent drop-off\nin the light curve at the time of coalescence. While there are indications that\nthe latter EM signature is a more robust one, a detection of either signal\ncoincidentally with GWs would be a convincing evidence for an impending SBH\nbinary coalescence. The observability of an EM counterpart in the hot accretion\nflow scenario depends on the details of a model. In the case of the most\nmassive binaries observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, upper\nlimits on luminosity imply that they may be identified by EM searches out to\nz~0.1-1. However, given the radiatively inefficient nature of the gas flow, we\nspeculate that a majority of massive binaries may appear as low luminosity AGN\nin the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 20:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2011 21:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Here I describe how recent observations and theoretical\nmodels of dynamo action in low-mass stars are partly confirming, and partly\nconfounding, this basic expectation. In particular, I present the results of\n3--D MHD simulations of dynamo action by convection in rotating spherical\nshells that approximate the interiors of 0.3 solar-mass stars at a range of\nrotation rates. The simulated stars can establish latitudinal differential\nrotation at their surfaces which is solar-like at ``rapid'' rotation rates\n(defined within) and anti-solar at slower rotation rates; the differential\nrotation is greatly reduced by feedback from strong dynamo-generated magnetic\nfields in some parameter regimes. I argue that this ``flip'' in the sense of\ndifferential rotation may be observable in the near future. I also briefly\ndescribe how the strength and morphology of the magnetic fields varies with the\nrotation rate of the simulated star, and show that the maximum magnetic\nenergies attained are compatible with simple scaling arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 20:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We show that in\nthe presence of accretion, the abundance of an element supported by the\nradiative levitation is given by the equilibrium between the radiative and\ngravitational accelerations, unless the abundance predicted by the steady-state\naccretion is much greater than the abundance supported by the radiative\nacceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 21:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The efficiency of the gas drag\ndepends on a parameter $\\eta$, which is the product of the solid body size and\ndensity. We find that the gravity of the protoplanetary disk has a\nnon-negligible effect on the trajectories. If a solid body re-enters the flared\ndisk, the re-entering radius depends on the stellar magnetic dipole moment, the\ndisk's gravity, the parameter $\\eta$, and the initial launching angle. The\ndisk's gravity can make the re-entering radius lower by up to 30%.

Only the solid bodies with a $\\eta$ larger\nthan but very close to $\\eta_t$ can be launched to a re-entering radius larger\nthan 1 AU. This size-sorting effect may explain why chondrules come with a\nnarrow range of sizes within each chondritic class.

Monte Carlo simulations for d=1, 2, and 3 show that when\nresources are easily available both species coexist. However, when the supply\nof resources is on an intermediate level, the species with slower metabolism\nbecomes extinct. On the other hand, when resources are scarce it is the species\nwith faster metabolism that becomes extinct. The range of coexistence of the\ntwo species increases with dimension. We suggest that our model might describe\nsome aspects of the competition between normal and tumor cells. With such an\ninterpretation, examples of tumor remission, recurrence and of different\nmorphologies are presented. In the d=1 and d=2 models, we analyse the nature of\nphase transitions: they are either discontinuous or belong to the\ndirected-percolation universality class, and in some cases they have an active\nsubcritical phase. In the d=2 case, one of the transitions seems to be\ncharacterized by critical exponents different than directed-percolation ones,\nbut this transition could be also weakly discontinuous. In the d=3 version,\nMonte Carlo simulations are in a good agreement with the solution of the\nmean-field approximation. This approximation predicts that oscillatory\nbehaviour occurs in the present model, but only for d>2. For d>=2, a steady\nstate depends on the initial configuration in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 23:33:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2011 21:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-09"}

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the\nstability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of\n\"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr\nspacetime. The ISCO frequency shift due to the conservative self-force in Kerr\nis also calculated from this new ISCO condition, as well as from the\neffective-one-body Hamiltonian of Barausse & Buonanno (2010).

Here we present\nobservations of P/2010 A2, a previously unknown inner-belt asteroid with a\npeculiar, comet-like morphology that is most likely the evolving remnant of a\nrecent asteroidal disruption. High resolution Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations reveal an approximately 120 meter diameter nucleus with an\nassociated tail of millimeter-sized dust particles formed in February/March\n2009, all evolving slowly under the action of solar radiation pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 05:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

We here present new deep\nspectroscopy covering the observed 4,000-7,000A with VLT/VIMOS and Subaru/FOCAS\nof 8 LAEs detected in NB359. All the 8 objects have only one detectable\nemission line around 4,970A which is most likely to be Ly-A at z=3.1, and thus,\nthe objects are certainly LAEs at the redshift. However, 5 of them show a\n~0.''8 spatial offset between the Ly-A emission and the source detected in\nNB359. No indications of the redshifts of the NB359 sources are found although\nit is statistically difficult that all the 5 LAEs have a foreground object\naccounting for the NB359 flux. The rest 3 LAEs show no significant offset from\nthe NB359 position. Therefore, they are truly LyC emitting LAEs at z=3.1. We\nalso examine the stellar population which simultaneously accounts for the\nstrength of the LyC and the spectral slope of non-ionizing ultraviolet of the\nLAEs. We consider the latest statistics of Lyman limit systems to estimate the\nLyC optical depth in the IGM and an additional contribution of the bound-free\nLyC from photo-ionized nebulae to the LyC emissivity. As a result, we find that\nstellar populations with metallicity Z>=1/50Z_sun can explain the observed LyC\nstrength only with a very top-heavy initial mass function (IMF; <m>~50 M_sun).\nHowever, the critical metallicity for such an IMF is expected to be much lower.\nA very young (~1 Myr) and massive (~100 M_sun) extremely metal-poor\n(Z<=5e-4Z_sun) or metal-free (so-called Population III) stellar population can\nreproduce the observed LyC strength. The required mass fraction of such\n`primordial' stellar population is ~1--10% in total stellar mass of the LAEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 06:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Tolerancing is an important step in\nthe product design because on it will depend the functionality of the mechanism\nits assemblibility but also its cost: manufacturing cost increases with the\nprecision of tolerances values. In our model, each feature specification is\ntranslated into tolerance zone. This zone limits displacements of the\ntoleranced feature. Limitations of this small displacements are expressed in a\nmathematical form by a 6-polytope in a 6 dimensions space (3 rotations and 3\ntranslations). In the same way, contact conditions in joints allow to write\nlinear inequalities which can be translated by 6-polytopes. Each domain is\ndefined by a set of vertices and a system of inequalities. Considering a chosen\ntolerancing, the method allows to verify the mechanism assemblibility but also\nseveral functional requirements.

We look at the way these two dual modes are used in\ndifferent approaches to information system, particularly the relational model\nfor database introduced by Codd in the 70's. This allows to point out diverse\nforms of a fundamental duality. These operational modes are also reinterpreted\nin the context of the comprehension schema of axiomatic set theory ZF.

One is often interested in an evolution\nequation for the large scale quantities without resolving the details of the\nsmall scales. As a result, there has been a significant effort in developing\ntime-averaged and spatially-filtered equations for large scale dynamics from\nthe fully resolved governing differential equations. One should realize that by\nstarting from these fully-resolved equations (e.g. the Euler or Navier-Stokes\nequations) to derive an averaged evolution equation one has already taken the\nlimit of the wave-numbers approaching infinity with no regards to our\nobservational abilities at such a limit. As a result, obtaining the evolution\nequations for large scale quantities (low wave-numbers) by an averaging or\nfiltering process is done after the fact. This could explain many of the\ntheoretical and computational difficulties with the Euler or Navier-Stokes\nequations. Here, a rather different approach is proposed. The averaging process\nin implemented before the derivation of the differential form of the transport\nequations. A new observable divergence concept is defined based on fluxes\ncalculated from observable quantities at a desired averaging scale, $\\alpha$.\nAn observable divergence theorem is then proved and applied in the derivation\nof the observable and regularized transport equations. We further show that the\napplication of the observable divergence theorem to incompressible flows\nresults in a formal derivation of the inviscid Leray turbulence model first\nproposed in 1934.

Combined with recent\nmeasurements from collinear laser spectroscopy showing a 1/2- spin and parity\nfor the ground state, the extracted results revealed evidence for a 1/2-; 3/2-\ndoublet near the ground state in 73 31Ga42 differing by at most 0.8 keV in\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 09:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 12:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2010 09:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-28"}

In this paper, we address the important role played by\nobservational strategies in averaging out the radial velocity signature of\nstellar noise. We also derive the planetary mass detection limits expected in\npresence of stellar noise. We start with HARPS asteroseismology measurements\nfor 4 stars (beta Hyi, alpha Cen A, mu Ara and tau Ceti) available in the ESO\narchive plus very precise measurements of alpha Cen B. This sample covers\ndifferent spectral types, from G2 to K1 and different evolutionary stage, from\nsubgiant to dwarf stars. Since the span of our data ranges between 5 to 8 days,\nwe will have access to oscillation modes and granulation phenomena, without\nimportant contribution of activity noise which is present at larger time\nscales. For those 5 stars, we generate synthetic radial velocity measurements\nafter fitting corresponding models of stellar noise in Fourier space. These\nmeasurements allows us to study the radial velocity variation due to stellar\nnoise for different observational strategies as well as the corresponding\nplanetary mass detection limits. Applying 3 measurements per night of 10\nminutes exposure each, 2 hours apart, seems to average out most efficiently the\nstellar noise considered. For quiet K1V stars as alpha Cen B, such a strategy\nallows us to detect planets of ~3 times the mass of Earth with an orbital\nperiod of 200 days, corresponding to the habitable zone of the star. Since\nactivity is not yet included in our simulation, these detection limits\ncorrespond to a case, which exist, where the host star has few magnetic\nfeatures. In this case stellar noise is dominated by oscillation modes and\ngranulation phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 09:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This paper makes two contributions on the guessing\nnumber. First, we introduce an undirected graph on all possible configurations\nof the digraph, referred to as the guessing graph, which encapsulates the\nessence of dependence amongst configurations. We prove that the guessing number\nof a digraph is equal to the logarithm of the independence number of its\nguessing graph. Therefore, network coding solvability is no more a problem on\nthe operations made by each node, but is simplified into a problem on the\nmessages that can transit through the network. By studying the guessing graph\nof a given digraph, and how to combine digraphs or alphabets, we are thus able\nto derive bounds on the guessing number of digraphs. Second, we construct\nspecific digraphs with high guessing numbers, yielding network coding instances\nwhere a large amount of information can transit. We first propose a\nconstruction of digraphs with finite parameters based on cyclic codes, with\nguessing number equal to the degree of the generator polynomial. We then\nconstruct an infinite class of digraphs with arbitrary girth for which the\nratio between the linear guessing number and the number of vertices tends to\none, despite these digraphs being arbitrarily sparse.

To investigate this question in detail, we have focused on the\npopularity of movies as measured by their box-office income. We observe that\nthe log-normal distribution describes well the tail (corresponding to the most\nsuccessful movies) of the empirical distributions for the total income, the\nincome on the opening week, as well as, the weekly income per theater. This\nobservation suggests that popularity may be the outcome of a linear\nmultiplicative stochastic process. In addition, the distributions of the total\nincome and the opening income show a bimodal form, with the majority of movies\neither performing very well or very poorly in theaters. We also observe that\nthe gross income per theater for a movie at any point during its lifetime is,\non average, inversely proportional to the period that has elapsed after its\nrelease. We argue that (i) the log-normal nature of the tail, (ii) the bimodal\nform of the overall gross income distribution, and (iii) the decay of gross\nincome per theater with time as a power law, constitute the fundamental set of\n{\\em stylized facts} (i.e., empirical \"laws\") that can be used to explain other\nobservations about movie popularity. We show that, in conjunction with an\nassumption of a fixed lower cut-off for income per theater below which a movie\nis withdrawn from a cinema, these laws can be used to derive a Weibull\ndistribution for the survival probability of movies which agrees with empirical\ndata. The connection to extreme-value distributions suggests that popularity\ncan be viewed as a process where a product becomes popular by avoiding failure\n(i.e., being pulled out from circulation) for many successive time periods. We\nsuggest that these results may apply to popularity in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 11:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-01"}

In\nreal space, operators of E and B mode decomposition involve only differentials\nof CMB polarization. We may, therefore in principle, perform a clean E/B\ndecomposition from incomplete sky data. Since it is impractical to apply second\nderivatives to observation data, we usually rely on spherical harmonic\ntransformation and inverse transformation, instead of using real-space\noperators. In spherical harmonic representation, jump discontinuities in a cut\nsky produces Gibbs phenomenon, unless a spherical harmonic expansion is made up\nto an infinitely high multipole. By smoothing a foreground mask, we may\nsuppress the Gibbs phenomenon effectively in a similar manner to apodization of\na foreground mask discussed in other works. However, we incur foreground\ncontamination by smoothing a foreground mask, because zero-value pixels in the\noriginal mask may be rendered non-zero by the smoothing process. In this work,\nwe investigate an optimal foreground mask, which ensures proper foreground\nmasking and suppresses Gibbs phenomenon.

A node equipped with such a radio cannot\nsimultaneously transmit and receive useful signals at the same frequency.\nUnlike in conventional designs, where a node's transmission frames are\nscheduled away from its reception, each node transmits its signal through a\nrandomly generated on-off duplex mask (or signature) over every frame interval,\nand receive a signal through each of its own off-slots. This is called rapid\non-off- division duplex (RODD). Over the period of a single frame, every node\ncan transmit a message to some or all of its peers, and may simultaneously\nreceive a message from each peer. Thus RODD achieves virtual full-duplex\ncommunication using half-duplex radios and can simplify the design of higher\nlayers of a network protocol stack significantly. The throughput of RODD is\nevaluated under some general settings, which is significantly larger than that\nof ALOHA. RODD is especially efficient in case the dominant traffic is\nsimultaneous broadcast from nodes to their one-hop peers, such as in\nspontaneous wireless social networks, emergency situations or on battlefield.\nImportant design issues of peer discovery, distribution of on-off signatures,\nsynchronization and error-control coding are also addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 14:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

In a related effect, Binary YORP (BYORP) the\norbital properties of a binary asteroid evolves under a radiation effect mostly\nacting on a tidally locked secondary. The BYORP effect can alter the orbital\nelements in $\\sim 10^{4-5}$ years for a $D_{p}=2\\;km$ primary with a\n$D_{s}=0.4\\; km$ secondary at $1\\; AU$. It can either separate the binary\ncomponents or cause them to collide. In this paper we devise a simple approach\nto calculate the YORP effect on asteroids and BYORP effect on binaries\nincluding $J_2$ effects due to primary oblateness and the sun. We apply this to\nasteroids with known shapes as well as a set of randomly generated bodies with\nvarious degrees of smoothness. We find a strong correlation between the\nstrengths of an asteroid's YORP and BYORP effects. Therefore, a statistical\nknowledge on one, could be used to estimate the effect of the other. We show\nthat the action of BYORP preferentially shrinks rather than expands the binary\norbit and that YORP preferentially slows down asteroids. This conclusion holds\nfor the two extremes of thermal conductivities studied in this work and\nassuming the asteroid reaches a stable point, but may break down for moderate\nthermal conductivity. The YORP and BYORP effects are shown to be smaller than\nwhat could be naively expected due to near cancellation of the effects on small\nscales. Taking this near cancellation into account, a simple order of magnitude\nestimate of the YORP and BYORP effects as function of the sizes and smoothness\nof the bodies is calculated. Finally, we provide a simple proof showing that\nthere is no secular effect due to absorption of radiation in BYORP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 14:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2010 08:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

Several\nmagnonic analog and digital logic devices have been proposed, and some\ndemonstrated.

In this framework, the description of the temporal\ncorrelation between turbulent eddies is an essential ingredient to model mode\namplitudes. However, there is a debate between a Gaussian or Lorentzian\ndescription of the eddy-time correlation function (Samadi et al. 2003, Chaplin\net al. 2005). Indeed, a Gaussian description reproduces the low-frequency shape\nof the mode amplitude for the Sun, but is unsatisfactory from a theoretical\npoint of view (Houdek, 2009) and leads to other disagreements with observations\n(Samadi et al., 2007). These are solved by using a Lorentzian description, but\nthere the low-frequency shape of the solar observations is not correctly\nreproduced. We reconcile the two descriptions by adopting the sweeping\napproximation, which consists in assuming that the eddy-time-correlation\nfunction is dominated by the advection of eddies, in the inertial range, by\nenergy-bearing eddies. Using a Lorentzian function together with a cut-off\nfrequency derived from the sweeping assumption allows us to reproduce the\nlow-frequency shape of the observations. This result also constitutes a\nvalidation of the sweeping assumption for highly turbulent flows as in the\nsolar case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 15:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In fact, a BP travels together with the\ninhomogeneity it creates. A natural question is what will happen with two BPs\nwhen they appear sufficiently close to each other such that the inhomogeneities\naround each of them start to interfere? In quest for the answer we examine\nhere, via Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of two BPs in a lattice gas of\nbath particles. We observe that for a sufficiently dense medium, surprisingly,\nboth BPs spend most of the time together which signifies that the interference\nof the microstructural inhomogeneities results in effectively attractive\ninteractions between them. Such statistical pairing of BPs minimizes the size\nof the inhomogeneity and hence reduces the frictional drag force exerted on the\nBPs by the medium. As a result, in some configurations the center-of-mass of a\npair of BPs propagates faster than a single isolated BP. These jamming-induced\nforces are very different from fundamental physical interactions, exist only in\npresence of an external force, and require the presence of a quiescent bath to\nmediate the interactions between the driven particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 15:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-08"}

Focusing on\nthe strongly frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ model and the spatially anisotropic\n$J_{1a}$-$J_{1b}$-$J_2$ model, very distinct low energy behaviors reflect\ndifferent levels of magnetic frustration. In the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, bound\nmagnons appear trapped near the impurity in the ground state and strongly\nreduce the ordered moments for sites proximal to the impurity. In contrast,\nlocal moments in the $J_{1a}$-$J_{1b}$-$J_2$ model are enhanced on the impurity\nneighboring sites. These theoretical predictions can be probed by experiments\nsuch as nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning tunneling microscopy, and the\nresults can elucidate the role of frustration in antiferromagnets and help\nnarrow the possible models to understand magnetism in the iron pnictdies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 20:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 19:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-28"}

The advantage of providing a\n(fixpoint) abstraction to the code consumer is that its validity is checked in\na single pass (i.e., one iteration) of an abstract interpretation-based\nchecker. A main challenge to make ACC useful in practice is to reduce the size\nof certificates as much as possible while at the same time not increasing\nchecking time. The intuitive idea is to only include in the certificate\ninformation that the checker is unable to reproduce without iterating. We\nintroduce the notion of reduced certificate which characterizes the subset of\nthe abstraction which a checker needs in order to validate (and re-construct)\nthe full certificate in a single pass. Based on this notion, we instrument a\ngeneric analysis algorithm with the necessary extensions in order to identify\nthe information relevant to the checker. Interestingly, the fact that the\nreduced certificate omits (parts of) the abstraction has implications in the\ndesign of the checker. We provide the sufficient conditions which allow us to\nensure that 1) if the checker succeeds in validating the certificate, then the\ncertificate is valid for the program (correctness) and 2) the checker will\nsucceed for any reduced certificate which is valid (completeness). Our approach\nhas been implemented and benchmarked within the ciaopp system. The experimental\nresults show that our proposal is able to greatly reduce the size of\ncertificates in practice.To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming\n(TPLP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 10:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-22"}
