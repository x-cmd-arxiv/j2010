Droplets\ncontaining solid particles show a preferential solute-migration during drying\nprocess. Recently we carried out experiments with vaporizing droplet suspended\nin an acoustic levitator. In this work, we present detailed study of a laser\nirradiated droplet containing nanosilica particles. Infrared and High speed\nimaging of the heating process for different concentrations of nanosilica\nrevealed an interesting solute migration pattern. Further investigation with\nParticle Image Velocimetry shows presence of strong recirculation within the\nlevitated droplet. It also reveals that with increasing viscosity of the liquid\nthe strength of this recirculation decreases. Due to the droplets rotation\nabout the levitator axis, a centrifugal force also dominated the flow field\nwithin the droplet. High speed imaging shows that initial stage of heating is\ndominated by sharper diameter reduction. At the end of this stage the droplet\ntakes a bowl shape. Next stage, which is termed as structure formation shows\ndifferent characteristics for higher and lower concentrations. For nanosilica\nconcentration of less than 1.3%, the bowl shape remains unaltered with further\nheating. On the other hand, for concentration greater than 1.9%, due to\nstronger centrifugal effect than recirculation, the particles migrate towards\nthe equator plane creating horizontal ring structure. The horizontal ring very\nsoon starts oscillating about the levitator axis. This creates an imbalance of\nforces resulting in reorientation of the ring. Thus a vertical ring is created.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2010 18:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}

Our major results include\ncalculating the LHC reach for each model's parameter space and prescribing a\nmethod for distinguishing the models after the collection of 100 fb^-1 at\nsqrt{s}=14 TeV. AMSB models are notorious for predicting too low a dark matter\nrelic density.

The results indicate that the\nVinet EOS model that fitted to low-pressure experimental data overestimates the\ncompressibility of dense hydrogen drastically when beyond 500 GPa. Metastable\nmulti-atomic molecular phases with weak covalent bonds are observed. When\ncompressed beyond about 2.8 TPa, these exotic low-coordinated phases become\ncompetitive with the groundstate and other high-symmetry atomic phases. Using\nnudged elastic band method, the transition path and the associated energy\nbarrier between these high-pressure phases are evaluated. In particular for the\ncase of dissociation of diatomic molecular phase into the atomic metallic Cs-IV\nphase, the existent barrier might raise the transition pressure about 200 GPa\nat low temperatures.

RSSI-based\ntechniques have been the preferred method for GSM localization on the handset\nas RSSI information is available in all cell phones. Although the GSM standard\nallows for a cell phone to receive signal strength information from up to seven\ncell towers, many of today's cell phones are low-end phones, with limited API\nsupport, that gives only information about the associated cell tower. In\naddition, in many places in the world, the density of cell towers is very small\nand therefore, the available cell tower information for localization is very\nlimited. This raises the challenge of accurately determining the cell phone\nlocation with very limited information, mainly the RSSI of the associated cell\ntower. In this paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model based solution that\nleverages the signal strength history from only the associated cell tower to\nachieve accurate GSM localization. We discuss the challenges of implementing\nour system and present the details of our system and how it addresses the\nchallenges. To evaluate our proposed system, we implemented it on Androidbased\nphones. Results for two different testbeds, representing urban and rural\nenvironments, show that our system provides at least 156% enhancement in median\nerror in rural areas and at least 68% enhancement in median error in urban\nareas compared to current RSSI-based GSM localization systems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2010 13:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}
