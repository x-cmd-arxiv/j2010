The paper answers two questions asked in the literature about\nthe iterated hairpin completion.\n  The first question is whether the class of regular languages is closed under\niterated bounded hairpin completion. Here we show that this is true by\nproviding a more general result which applies to all the classes of languages\nwhich are closed under finite union, intersection with regular sets, and\nconcatenation with regular sets. In particular, all Chomsky classes and all\nstandard complexity classes are closed under iterated bounded hairpin\ncompletion.\n  In the second part of the paper we address the question whether the iterated\nhairpin completion of a singleton is always regular. In contrast to the first\nquestion, this one has a negative answer. We exhibit an example of a singleton\nlanguage whose iterated hairpin completion is not regular, actually it is not\ncontext-free, but context-sensitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 16:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2011 15:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2011 17:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The initial sample is a collection of\n174 early-type stars selected from the literature. The stars are first\nclassified according to their evolutionary status in order to obtain a\nhomogeneous sample of 96 genuine main sequence stars. Their present velocities\nand flight times are then estimated using proper motion data from various\nastrometric catalogues (including Tycho-2, UCAC2, and USNO-B) and the ejection\nvelocities are computed by tracing their orbits back in time, based on a\ngalactic potential. The potential used is constructed from a mass density model\nchosen to fit the most recent observational constraints. We find evidence for\ntwo different populations of runaway stars: a \"high\" velocity population, with\na maximum ejection velocity of about 400 - 500 km/s, and a \"low\" velocity\npopulation, with a maximum ejection velocity of about 300 km/s.

This aerodynamic constraint limits the amount of power that can\nbe extracted from a given wind farm footprint. The resulting inefficiency of\nHAWT farms is currently compensated by using taller wind turbines to access\ngreater wind resources at high altitudes, but this solution comes at the\nexpense of higher engineering costs and greater visual, acoustic, radar and\nenvironmental impacts. We investigated the use of counter-rotating\nvertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in order to achieve higher power output per\nunit land area than existing wind farms consisting of HAWTs. Full-scale field\ntests of 10-m tall VAWTs in various counter-rotating configurations were\nconducted under natural wind conditions during summer 2010. Whereas modern wind\nfarms consisting of HAWTs produce 2 to 3 watts of power per square meter of\nland area, these field tests indicate that power densities an order of\nmagnitude greater can potentially be achieved by arranging VAWTs in layouts\nthat enable them to extract energy from adjacent wakes and from above the wind\nfarm. Moreover, this improved performance does not require higher individual\nwind turbine efficiency, only closer wind turbine spacing and a sufficient\nvertical flux of turbulence kinetic energy from the atmospheric surface layer.\nThe results suggest an alternative approach to wind farming that has the\npotential to concurrently reduce the cost, size, and environmental impacts of\nwind farms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 17:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2010 17:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 04:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-27"}

Observations of these shocks can provide valuable\ninformation on the merger dynamics and physical conditions in the cluster\nplasma, and even help constrain the nature of dark matter. To study shock\nfronts, one needs an X-ray telescope with high angular resolution (such as\nChandra), and be lucky to see the merger from the right angle and at the right\nmoment. As of this writing, only a handful of merger shock fronts have been\ndiscovered and confirmed using both X-ray imaging and gas temperature data --\nthose in 1E0657-56, A520, A754, and two fronts in A2146. A few more are\nprobable shocks awaiting temperature profile confirmation -- those in A521,\nRXJ1314-25, A3667, A2744, and Coma. The highest Mach number is 3 in 1E0657-56,\nwhile the rest has M=1.6-2.

This is contrary to the common\nwisdom that weak shocks are inefficient particle accelerators, and may shed\nlight on the mechanisms of relativistic electron production in astrophysical\nplasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 17:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}

In particular, we study the case of a silver grating\nplaced in vacuo. Consistent with previous studies on the topic, we highlight\nthat the main mechanism for extraordinary transmission is a TM-Fabry-Perot (FP)\nbranch supported by waveguide modes inside each slit. The TM-FP branch may also\ninteract with surface plasmons (SPs) at the air/Ag interface through the\nreciprocal lattice vectors of the grating, for periods comparable with the\nincoming wavelength. When the TM-FP branch crosses a SP branch, a band gap is\nformed along the line of the SP dispersion. The gap has a Fano-Feshbach\nresonance at the low frequency band edge and a ridge resonance with extremely\nlong lifetime at the high frequency band edge. We discuss the nature of these\ndispersion features, and in particular we describe the ridge resonance in the\nframework of guided-mode resonances (GMRs).

The equations are second-order and importantly, they reduce the loop\nlevel by one, so that they can be solved iteratively in the loop order. We\npresent several infinite series of integrals satisfying such iterative\ndifferential equations. The differential operators we use are best written\nusing momentum twistor space. The use of the latter was advocated in recent\npapers discussing loop integrals in N=4 super Yang-Mills. One of our\nmotivations is to provide a tool for deriving analytical results for scattering\namplitudes in this theory. We show that the integrals needed for planar MHV\namplitudes up to two loops can be thought of as deriving from a single master\ntopology. The master integral satisfies our differential equations, and so do\nmost of the reduced integrals. A consequence of the differential equations is\nthat the integrals we discuss are not arbitrarily complicated transcendental\nfunctions. For two specific two-loop integrals we give the full analytic\nsolution. The simplicity of the integrals appearing in the scattering\namplitudes in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills is strongly suggestive of a relation\nto the conjectured underlying integrability of the theory. We expect these\ndifferential equations to be relevant for all planar MHV and non-MHV\namplitudes.

One\nspecific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the\ncurvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with\nrespect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether\nthis is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of\ndamped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case\nof two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to\nthe scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory\nfor the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full\nmulti-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this\neffective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a\nfunctional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during\ninflation.

The former case is suggested\nby its association with a decaying non-thermal radio source, while the latter\nis suggested by its peculiar transient light curve and its low initial\nexpansion velocities. The crucial difference is that the star survives a\ntransient eruption but not an SN. All stars identified as possible survivors\nare significantly fainter, L_opt ~ 10^5 Lsun, than the L_opt ~ 3 10^6 Lsun\nprogenitor star at optical wavelengths. While this can be explained by dust\nabsorption in a shell of material ejected during the transient, the survivor\nmust then be present as a L_IR ~ 3 10^6 Lsun mid-infrared source. Using\narchival Spitzer observations of the region, we show that such a luminous\nmid-IR source is not present. The brightest source of dust emission is only\nL_IR ~ 10^5 Lsun and does not correspond to the previously identified\ncandidates for the surviving star. The dust cannot be made sufficiently distant\nand cold to avoid detection unless the ejection energy, mass and velocity\nscales are those of a SN or greater. We conclude that SN 1961V was a peculiar,\nbut real, supernova. Its peculiarities are probably due to enhanced mass loss\njust prior to the SN, followed by the interactions of the SN blast wave with\nthis ejecta. This adds to the evidence that there is a population of SN\nprogenitors that have major mass loss episodes shortly before core collapse.\nThe progenitor is a low metallicity, ~1/3 solar, high mass, M_ZAMS > 80 Msun,\nstar, which means either that BH formation can be accompanied by an SN or that\nsurprisingly high mass stars can form a NS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The most likely explanation for the variability is that a\nstructure in the BAL outflow moved out of our line of sight to the ultraviolet\ncontinuum emitting region of the quasar's accretion disk.

An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these\nexothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a\nrate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight\nconfinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can\napproach each other only in a \"side-by-side\" collision, where the chemical\nreaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show\nthat the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state\ncontrol of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.\nThe suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar\nmolecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the\ndipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to\nquantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where\nquantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 20:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

It has since\nbeen claimed by Miller et al that the lag can be produced by more distant\nmatter, at hundreds of gravitational radii (an outer reflector). Here, we\ncritically explore their interpretation of the lag. The detailed energy\ndependence of the time lags between soft and hard energy bands is well modelled\nby an inner reflector using our previously published spectral model. A contrary\nclaim by Miller et al was obtained by neglecting the blackbody component in the\nsoft band. Soft lags can be produced by a large-scale outer reflector if\nseveral, implausible, conditions are met. An additional transfer function is\nrequired in the soft band corresponding to a region that is physically close to\nthe continuum source, or lies close to our line of sight and subtends a small\nsolid angle at the source, challenging the production of the observed spectrum.\nWe show that the original inner reflector interpretation of reverberation very\nclose to the black hole provides a self-consistent and robust model which\nexplains the energy spectrum and timing properties, including the time delays,\npower spectra and the shape of the coherence function. Several of these\nproperties are opposite to the predictions from a simple large-scale outer\nreflection model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 21:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

From a series of calculations of\nsupersonic, hydrodynamic turbulence driven using purely solenoidal Fourier\nmodes, we find that the `standard' relationship between the variance in the log\nof density and the Mach number squared, i.e., sigma^2_(ln rho/rhobar)=ln (1+b^2\nM^2), with b = 1/3 is a good fit to the numerical results in the supersonic\nregime up to at least Mach 20, similar to previous determinations at lower Mach\nnumbers. While direct measurements of the variance in linear density are found\nto be severely underestimated by finite resolution effects, it is possible to\ninfer the linear density variance via the assumption of log-normality in the\nProbability Distribution Function. The inferred relationship with Mach number,\nconsistent with sigma_(rho/rhobar) ~ b M with b=1/3, is, however, significantly\nshallower than observational determinations of the relationship in the Taurus\nMolecular Cloud and IC5146 (both consistent with b~ 0.5), implying that\nadditional physics such as gravity is important in these clouds and/or that\nturbulent driving in the ISM contains a significant compressive component.\nMagnetic fields are not found to change this picture significantly, in general\nreducing the measured variances and thus worsening the discrepancy with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 22:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 23:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at\nperiastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very\neccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR140.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 01:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 17:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Utilizing the\narchival ASM data of 27 AGNs, we calculate the normalized excess variances of\nthe 300-day binned X-ray light curves on the longest timescale (between 300\ndays and 14 years) explored so far. The observed variance appears to be\nindependent of AGN black hole mass and bolometric luminosity, respectively.\nAccording to the scaling relation with black hole mass (and bolometric\nluminosity) from Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (GBHs) to AGNs, the break\ntimescales which correspond to the break frequencies detected in the power\nspectral density (PSD) of our AGNs are larger than binsize (300 days) of the\nASM light curves. As a result, the singly broken power-law (soft-state) PSD\npredicts the variance to be independent of mass and luminosity, respectively.\nNevertheless, the doubly-broken power-law (hard-state) PSD predicts, with the\nwidely accepted ratio of the two break frequencies, that the variance increases\nwith increasing mass and decreases with increasing luminosity, respectively.\nTherefore, the independence of the observed variance on mass and luminosity\nsuggests that AGNs should have the soft-state PSDs. If taking into account the\nscaling of breaking timescale with mass and luminosity synchronously, the\nobserved variances are also more consistent with the soft-state than the\nhard-state PSD predictions.

To reduce\ntheir contribution, timing measurements can be made over a range of frequencies\nthat depends on a variety of pulsar and instrumentation-dependent factors that\nwe identify. A salient trend for high signal-to-noise measurements of\nmillisecond pulsars is that time-of-arrival precision is limited either by\nirreducible interstellar scattering or by pulse-phase jitter caused by variable\nemission within pulsar magnetospheres. A cap on timing errors implies that\npulsars must be confined to low dispersion measures (DMs) and observed at high\nfrequencies. Use of wider bandwidths that increase signal-to-noise ratios will\ndegrade timing precision if nondispersive chromatic effects are not mitigated.\nThe allowable region in the DM-frequency plane depends on how chromatic timing\nperturbations are addressed. Without mitigation, observations at 1.4~GHz or\n5~GHz are restricted to $\\DM\\lesssim 30$ and $\\lesssim 100~\\DMu$, respectively.\nWith aggressive mitigation of interstellar scattering and use of large\ntelescopes to provide adequate sensitivity at high frequencies (e.g. Arecibo,\nFAST, phase 1 of the SKA, and the SKA), pulsars with DMs up to 500~$\\DMu$ can\nbe used in precision timing applications.

Interestingly,\narbitrary valued $M_5$-dipole charged rotating circular strings and Maldacena\nStrominger Witten black rings exhibit non-degenerate, positively curved,\ncomprehensively regular state-space configurations. Furthermore, the\nstate-space geometry of single bubbled rings admits a well-defined, positive\ndefinite, everywhere regular and curved intrinsic Riemannian manifold; except\nfor the two finite values of conserved electric charge. We also discuss the\nimplication and potential significance of this work for the physics of black\nholes in string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 09:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 14:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We show the existence of a positive and\ntime-dependent correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and per\ncapita CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Employing this empirical\nrelation, extrapolating the HDI, and using three population scenarios, the\ncumulative CO2 emissions necessary for developing countries to achieve\nparticular HDI thresholds are assessed following a Development As Usual\napproach (DAU). If current demographic and development trends are maintained,\nwe estimate that by 2050 around 85% of the world's population will live in\ncountries with high HDI (above 0.8). In particular, 300Gt of cumulative CO2\nemissions between 2000 and 2050 are estimated to be necessary for the\ndevelopment of 104 developing countries in the year 2000. This value represents\nbetween 20% to 30% of previously calculated CO2 budgets limiting global warming\nto 2{\\deg}C. These constraints and results are incorporated into a CO2\nreduction framework involving four domains of climate action for individual\ncountries.

No dynamo action occurs for\naxisymmetric flow while we always found a dynamo when non-axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical instabilities are excited. Without rotation of the outer sphere,\ntypical critical magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm_c$ are of the order of a few\nthousands. They increase as the mechanical forcing imposed by the inner core on\nthe flow increases (Reynolds number $Re$). Namely, no dynamo is found if the\nmagnetic Prandtl number $Pm=Rm/Re$ is less than a critical value $Pm_c\\sim 1$.\nOscillating quadrupolar dynamos are present in the vicinity of the dynamo\nonset. Saturated magnetic fields obtained in supercritical regimes (either\n$Re>2 Re_c$ or $Pm>2Pm_c$) correspond to the equipartition between magnetic and\nkinetic energies. A global rotation of the system (Ekman numbers $E=10^{-3},\n10^{-4}$) yields to a slight decrease (factor 2) of the critical magnetic\nPrandtl number, but we find a peculiar regime where dynamo action may be\nobtained for relatively low magnetic Reynolds numbers ($Rm_c\\sim 300$). In this\ndynamical regime (Rossby number $Ro\\sim -1$, spheres in opposite direction) at\na moderate Ekman number ($E=10^{-3}$), a enhanced shear layer around the inner\ncore might explain the decrease of the dynamo threshold.

They\nhave completely different characteristics and are associated with different\nkinds of ejections. One kind of emission has a flat or inverted spectrum\nindicating optically thick self-absorbed synchrotron emission; the second kind\nof emission corresponds to an optically thin \"transient\" outburst. The flat or\ninverted spectrum covers the whole radio band and has been established also at\nmillimeter and infrared wavelengths. When this kind of radio emission is\nspatially resolved it appears as a continuous jet, the so-called \"steady jet\".\nIn contrast, transient jets associated with optically thin events are resolved\nas \"plasmoids\" moving at relativistic speeds away from the center of the\nsystem. The most important point is that the two kinds of radio emission and\ntheir corresponding types of ejections seem to be related to each other; the\noptically thin outburst that characterizes the transient jet occurs after an\ninterval of emission with flat/inverted spectrum. Two different models\nsuccessfully describe the two jets: a conical flow and shocks.

This paper describes the pilot study of the three sources\nIRAS12326-6245, IRAS16060-5146, and IRAS16065-5158. To characterize the\nphysical and chemical properties of southern massive star-forming regions, the\nthree high-luminosity southern hemisphere hot cores were observed with APEX in\nfive frequency setups aimed at groups of lines from the following molecules:\nCH3OH, H2CO, and CH3CN. Using the LTE approximation, temperatures, source\nsizes, and column densities were determined through modeling of synthetic\nspectra with the XCLASS program. Dust continuum observations were done with the\nLarge APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) at 870um and the 3mm continuum was imaged\nwith the ATCA. Based on the detection of high-excitation CH3CN lines and lines\nfrom complex organic species, the three sources are classified as line rich,\nhot core type sources. For all three, the modeling indicates that the line\nemission emerges from a combination of an extended, cooler envelope, and a hot\ncompact component. All three sources show an overabundance of oxygen-bearing\nspecies compared to nitrogen-bearing species. Based on the results obtained in\nthe three sources, which served as templates for the survey, the most promising\n(and feasible) frequency setups for the remaining 44 sources were decided upon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 12:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We report on simulations of the interplay of differential rotation and\nmagnetic fields, the stability limits and non-linear evolution of such\nconfigurations, and the prospects of dynamo action from the unstable cases. The\naxisymmetric problem delivers a balance between field amplification and\nback-reaction of the magnetic field on the differential rotation. The\nnon-axisymmetric case involves also the Tayler instability of the amplified\ntoroidal fields. We consider limits for field amplification and apply these to\nyoung A stars. Apart from its application to Ap stars, the instability is\nscrutinized for the fundamental possibility of a dynamo. We are not looking for\na dynamo as an explanation for the Ap star phenomenon. The kinetic helicity is\nconcentrated near the tangent cylinder of the inner sphere of the computational\ndomain and is negative in the northern hemisphere.

In literature, both\nresponse-adaptive randomization (RAR) procedures (by changing randomization\nprocedure sequentially) and sequential monitoring (by changing analysis\nprocedure sequentially) have been proposed to achieve these objectives to some\ndegree. In this paper, we propose to sequentially monitor response-adaptive\nrandomized clinical trial and study it's properties. We prove that the\nsequential test statistics of the new procedure converge to a Brownian motion\nin distribution. Further, we show that the sequential test statistics\nasymptotically satisfy the canonical joint distribution defined in Jennison and\nTurnbull (\\citeyearJT00). Therefore, type I error and other objectives can be\nachieved theoretically by selecting appropriate boundaries. These results open\na door to sequentially monitor response-adaptive randomized clinical trials in\npractice. We can also observe from the simulation studies that, the proposed\nprocedure brings together the advantages of both techniques, in dealing with\npower, total sample size and total failure numbers, while keeps the type I\nerror.

With the aid of a new polarimeter attached to the HARPS\nspectrometer at the ESO 3.6m-telescope, we obtained high-quality circular\npolarization spectra of 41 single and double HgMn stars. Using a multi-line\nanalysis technique on each star, we co-added information from hundreds of\nspectral lines resulting in significantly greater sensitivity to the presence\nof magnetic fields, including very weak fields. For the 47 individual objects\nstudied, including 6 components of SB2 systems, we do not detect any magnetic\nfields at greater than the 3 sigma level. The lack of detection in the circular\npolarization profiles indicates that if strong fields are present on these\nstars, they must have complex surface topologies. For simple global fields, our\ndetection limits imply upper limits to the fields present of 2-10 Gauss in the\nbest cases. We conclude that HgMn stars lack large-scale magnetic fields,\ntypical for spotted magnetic Ap stars, sufficient to form and sustain the\nchemical spots observed on HgMn stars. Our study confirms that in addition to\nmagnetically altered atomic diffusion, there exists another differentiation\nmechanism operating in the atmospheres of late-B main sequence stars which can\ncompositional inhomogeneities on their surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 14:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However, they require that all the entries of the\nobservation matrix are known. This is unlikely to happen in practice, due to\nself-occlusion and limited field of view. Also, when processing long videos,\nregions that become occluded often appear again later. Current factorization\nmethods process these as new regions, leading to less accurate estimates of 3-D\nstructure. In this paper, we propose a global factorization method that infers\ncomplete 3-D models directly from the 2-D projections in the entire set of\navailable video frames. Our method decides whether a region that has become\nvisible is a region that was seen before, or a previously unseen region, in a\nglobal way, i.e., by seeking the simplest rigid object that describes well the\nentire set of observations. This global approach increases significantly the\naccuracy of the estimates of the 3-D shape of the scene and the 3-D motion of\nthe camera. Experiments with artificial and real videos illustrate the good\nperformance of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 14:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

In this paper, we introduce a semi-Markovian framework to analyze the\nperformance of two of the most popular rate adaptation algorithms used in\nwireless LANs, namely Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF) and Adaptive Automatic Rate\nFallback (AARF). Given our modeling assumptions, the analysis is exact and\nprovides closed form expressions for the achievable throughput of ARF and AARF.\nWe illustrate the benefit of our analysis by numerically comparing the\nthroughput performance of ARF and AARF in two different channel regimes. The\nresults show that neither of these algorithms consistently outperforms the\nother. We thus propose and analyze a new variant to AARF, called Persistent\nAARF (or PAARF), and show that it achieves a good compromise between the two\nalgorithms, often performing close to the best algorithm in each of the studied\nregimes. The numerical results also shed light into the impact of MAC overhead\non the performance of the three algorithms.

This state has been shown to generate a small\ncosmological constant in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. Here\nwe show that the usual Lorenz gauge-breaking term now plays the role of an\neffective electromagnetic current. Such a current is generated during inflation\nfrom quantum fluctuations and gives rise to a stochastic effective charge\ndensity distribution. Due to the high electric conductivity of the cosmic\nplasma after inflation, the electric charge density generates currents which\ngive rise to both vorticity and magnetic fields on sub-Hubble scales. Present\nupper limits on vorticity coming from temperature anisotropies of the CMB are\ntranslated into lower limits on the present value of cosmic magnetic fields. We\nfind that, for a nearly scale invariant vorticity spectrum, magnetic fields\n$B_{\\lambda}> 10^{-12}$ G are typically generated with coherence lengths\nranging from sub-galactic scales up to the present Hubble radius.

Castor oil (viscosity =\n500 mPas) is used and the Reynolds number was fixed to 24,000. The process was\nrecorded with a high-speed camera. Initially, the oil is at the air water\ninterface. At the beginning of the stirring, the oil is dragged into the liquid\nbulk and rotates around the impeller shaft, then is pushed radially into the\nflow ejected by the impeller. In this region, the flow is turbulent and\nexhibits velocity gradients that contribute to elongate the oil phase. Viscous\nthin filaments are generated and expelled from the impeller. Thereafter, the\nfilaments are elongated and break to form drops. This process is repeated in\nall the oil phase and drops are incorporated into the dispersion. Two main\nzones can be identified in the tank: the impeller discharge characterized by\nhigh turbulence and the rest of the flow where low velocity gradients appear.\nIn this region surface forces dominate the inertial ones, and drops became\nspheroidal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 18:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}
