For energies below the pion-production threshold it is\npossible to eliminate the pionic degrees of freedom and derive nuclear\npotentials and nuclear current operators solely in terms of the nucleonic\ndegrees of freedom. This is very important because, despite a lot of experience\ngained in the past, the consistency between two-nucleon forces, many-nucleon\nforces and the corresponding current operators has not been achieved yet.

One is to deplete the lithium abundance during the early phase of\nred giant branch. Another is to decrease the C/N ratio by one order of\nmagnitude during the red giant branch phase.

For battery replenishment, a model with discrete packets\nof energy arrivals is considered.

The channel\nassociated with the relay is thus an out-of-band relay channel (OBRC). The\nfocus is on a symmetric channel model, in order to assess the fundamental\nimpact of the OBRC on the signal interaction of the IC, in the simplest\npossible setting. First, the linear deterministic model is investigated and the\nsum capacity of this channel is established for all possible channel\nparameters. In particular, it is observed that the impact of OBRC, as its links\nget stronger, is similar to that of output feedback for the IC. The insights\nobtained from the deterministic model are then used to design achievable\nschemes for the Gaussian model. The interference links are classified as\nextremely strong, very strong, strong, moderate, weak, and very weak. For\nstrong and moderate interference, separate encoding is near optimal. For very\nstrong and extremely strong interference, the interference links provide side\ninformation to the destinations, which can help the transmission through the\nOBRC. For weak or very weak interference, an extension of the Han-Kobayashi\nscheme for the IC is utilized, where the messages are split into common and\nprivate. To achieve higher rates, it is beneficial to further split the common\nmessage into two parts, and the OBRC plays an important role in decoding the\ncommon message. It is shown that our strategy achieves the symmetric capacity\nto within 1.14625 bits per channel use with duplexing factor 0.5, and 1.27125\nbits per channel use for arbitrary duplexing factors, for all channel\nparameters. An important observation from the constant gap result is that\nstrong interference can be beneficial with the presence of an OBR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 18:39:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 01:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

These settings are in fact the densest pieces of the\ncosmic web, where no hot particles show up, and dynamically organized as a\nhierarchy of flow convergence regions, that is, attraction basins for mass\nflows. On the other hand, mass elements identified at the diffuse hot coronae\nsurrounding massive galaxies at z = 0, do not display a clear web-like\nmorphology at any z. Diffuse gas is heated when flow convergence regions go\nthrough contractive deformations, and most of it keeps hot and with low density\nalong the evolution.\n  To shed light on the physical foundations of the behaviour our analyses show\nup, as well as on their possible observational implications, these patterns\nhave been confronted with some generic properties of singular flows as\ndescribed by the adhesion model.

Prior to decoupling the balance between tidal and viscous\ntorques drives the disk to a quasistationary equilibrium state, perturbed\nslightly by small amplitude, spiral density waves emanating from the edges of\nthe gap. We consider a black hole binary with a companion of smaller mass and\nconstruct a simple Newtonian model for a geometrically thin, Keplerian disk in\nthe orbital plane of the binary.

We examine, in detail, the topology of such magnetic configurations using\nan analytical source surface model that allows for analysis of the field with\narbitrary resolution. Our analysis reveals three important new results: First,\na coronal hole boundary can join stably to the separatrix boundary of a\nparasitic polarity region. Second, a single parasitic polarity region can\nproduce multiple null points in the corona and, more important, separator lines\nconnecting these points. It is known that such topologies are extremely\nfavorable for magnetic reconnection, because they allow this process to occur\nover the entire length of the separators rather than being confined to a small\nregion around the nulls. Finally, the coronal holes are not connected by an\nopen-field corridor of finite width, but instead are linked by a singular line\nthat coincides with the separatrix footprint of the parasitic polarity. We\ninvestigate how the topological features described above evolve in response to\nthe motion of the parasitic polarity region.

We examine the magnetospheric structure using a 3D isothermal\nmagnetohydrodynamic model that includes: a static \"dead zone\" near the magnetic\nequator containing magnetically confined gas; a \"wind zone\" outside the\nmagnetic equator in which thermal pressure gradients and the\nmagneto-centrifugal-tidal effect give rise to transonic outflow; and a region\nnear the poles where sufficiently strong tidal forces may suppress transonic\noutflow. Using dipole field geometry, we estimate the size of the dead zone to\nbe ~1-10 planetary radii for a range of parameters. To understand appropriate\nbase conditions for the 3D isothermal model, we compute a 1D thermal model in\nwhich photoelectric heating from the stellar Lyman continuum is balanced by\ncollisionally-excited Lyman {\\alpha} cooling. This 1D model exhibits a H layer\nwith temperatures T=5000-10000K down to pressures of 10-100 nbar. Using the 3D\nisothermal model, we compute H column densities and Lyman {\\alpha} transmission\nspectra for parameters appropriate to HD 209458b. Line-integrated transit\ndepths of 5-10% can be achieved for the above base conditions. Strong magnetic\nfields increase the transit signal while decreasing the mass loss, due to\nhigher covering fraction and density of the dead zone. In our model, most of\nthe transit signal arises from magnetically confined gas, some of which may be\noutside the L1 equipotential. Hence the presence of gas outside the L1\nequipotential does not directly imply mass loss. Lastly, we discuss the domain\nof applicability for the magnetic wind model described in this paper and in the\nRoche-lobe overflow model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In doing so, we consider a family of\ngeneric goodput-based utilities that facilitate, e.g., throughput-based\npricing, quality-of-service enforcement, and/or the treatment of practical\nmodulation-and-coding schemes (MCS). Since perfect knowledge of channel state\ninformation (CSI) may be difficult to maintain at the base-station, especially\nwhen the number of users and/or subchannels is large, we consider scheduling\nand resource allocation under imperfect CSI, where the channel state is\ndescribed by a generic probability distribution. First, we consider the\n\"continuous\" case where multiple users and/or code rates can time-share a\nsingle OFDMA subchannel and time slot. This yields a non-convex optimization\nproblem that we convert into a convex optimization problem and solve exactly\nusing a dual optimization approach. Second, we consider the \"discrete\" case\nwhere only a single user and code rate is allowed per OFDMA subchannel per time\nslot. For the mixed-integer optimization problem that arises, we discuss the\nconnections it has with the continuous case and show that it can solved exactly\nin some situations. For the other situations, we present a bound on the\noptimality gap. For both cases, we provide algorithmic implementations of the\nobtained solution. Finally, we study, numerically, the performance of the\nproposed algorithms under various degrees of CSI uncertainty, utilities, and\nOFDMA system configurations. In addition, we demonstrate advantages relative to\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 21:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2011 18:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2011 17:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This result can be used to prove the result of\nSparre Andersen (1954) that the number of vertices of the smallest concave\nmajorant of the empirical distribution function of a sample of size n from the\nuniform distribution on [0,1] is asymptotically normal, with an asymptotic\nexpectation and variance which are both of order log n. A similar (Markovian)\ninverse jump process was introduced in Groeneboom (1989), in an analysis of the\nleast concave majorant of two-sided Brownian motion with a parabolic drift.\nThis process is quite different from the process for one-sided Brownian motion\nwithout drift: the number of vertices in a (corresponding slopes) interval has\nan expectation proportional to the length of the interval and the variance of\nthe number of vertices in such an interval is about half the size of the\nexpectation, if the length of the interval tends to infinity. We prove an\nasymptotic normality result for the number of vertices in an increasing\ninterval, which translates into a corresponding result for the least concave\nmajorant of an empirical distribution function of a sample of size n, generated\nby a strictly concave distribution function. In this case the number of\nvertices is of order cube root n, and the variance is again about half the size\nof the asymptotic expectation. As a side result we obtain some interesting\nrelations between the first moments of the number of vertices, the square of\nthe location of the maximum of Brownian motion minus a parabola, the value of\nthe maximum itself, the squared slope of the least concave majorant at zero,\nand the value of the least concave majorant at zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 21:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2011 13:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2011 14:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 15:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

Therefore\neven weak magnetic fields from AGNs can be used to magnetize the cluster to the\nobserved level. The final magnetic energy in the ICM is determined by the ICM\nturbulent energy, with a weak dependence on the AGN injection energy.

Therefore,\nRL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state\nitself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the\nsuitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification\n(SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much\ninformation as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two\napproaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set\nof features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function\napproximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called\nPredictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive\nstate representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects a\nlarge set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of\npredictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to\nestimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior\napproaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent,\nperform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its\npotential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 03:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 02:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The\nphysical conditions within the observed areas are inferred from spectroscopic\ndata obtained from IRS and from SWS and LWS onboard ISO, together with\nphotometric data from Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). Adopting a\npower-law distribution for the gas temperature in the observed region, the H2\nS(0) to S(7) spectral line maps obtained with IRS were used to constrain the\ngas density, yielding estimated n(H2) in the range 2-4*10^3 cm^-3. The\nexcitation of H2 S(9) to S(12) and high-J CO pure rotational lines, however,\nrequire environments several times denser. The inconsistency among the best-fit\ndensities estimated from different species can be explained by density\nfluctuations within the observed regions.

The zeros of this beta\nfunction are isolated points in the landscape of quantum field theories, and so\nwe arrive at a denumerable, or perhaps even finite, set of quantum theories for\nmatter, where not only the coupling constants, but also the masses and the\ncosmological constant are all fixed, and computable, in terms of the Planck\nunits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 11:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-02"}

It has revisited all attempts at a full physical understanding or\nmathematical formulation. The main reason for this failure are related to the\nlarge hierarchy of scales involved, the highly nonlinear character inherent in\nthe Navier-Stokes equations, and the spatial intermittency of the dynamically\nactive regions. Richardson has described the interplay between large and small\nscales and the phenomena so described are known as the Richardson cascade. This\nlocal interplay also forms the basis of a theory by Kolmogorov. In this letter,\nwe use the explicit map method to analyze the nonlinear dynamical behavior for\ncascade in isotropic turbulence. This deductive scale analysis is shown to\nprovide the first visual evidence of the celebrated Richardson cascade, and\nreveals in particular its multiscale character. The results also indicate that\nthe energy cascading process has remarkable similarities with the deterministic\nconstruction rules of the logistic map. Cascade of period-doubling bifurcations\nhave been seen in this isotropic turbulent systems that exhibit chaotic\nbehavior. The `cascade' appears as an infinite sequence of period-doubling\nbifurcations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 11:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-13"}

This interaction provides a way to electrically\ncontrol spins and as such lies at the foundation of spintronics. Even at the\nlevel of single electrons, spin-orbit interaction has proven promising for\ncoherent spin rotations. Here we report a spin-orbit quantum bit implemented in\nan InAs nanowire, where spin-orbit interaction is so strong that spin and\nmotion can no longer be separated. In this regime we realize fast qubit\nrotations and universal single qubit control using only electric fields. We\nenhance coherence by dynamically decoupling the qubit from the environment. Our\nqubits are individually addressable: they are hosted in single-electron quantum\ndots, each of which has a different Land\\'e g-factor. The demonstration of a\nnanowire qubit opens ways to harness the advantages of nanowires for use in\nquantum computing. Nanowires can serve as one-dimensional templates for\nscalable qubit registers. Unique to nanowires is the possibility to easily vary\nthe material even during wire growth. Such flexibility can be used to design\nwires with suppressed decoherence and push semiconductor qubit fidelities\ntowards error-correction levels. Furthermore, electrical dots can be integrated\nwith optical dots in p-n junction nanowires. The coherence times achieved here\nare sufficient for the conversion of an electronic qubit into a photon, the\nflying qubit, for long-distance quantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 11:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The method considers the null\nfour-vectors built from the period of the pulses and the direction cosines of\nthe propagation from each source. Starting from a simplified problem (a\nreceiver at rest) we have been able to calibrate our procedure, evidencing the\ninfluence of the uncertainty on the arrival times of the pulses as measured by\nthe receiver, and of the numerical treatment of the data. The most relevant\nparameter turns out to be the accuracy of the clock used by the receiver.\nActually the uncertainty used in the simulations combines both the accuracy of\nthe clock and the fluctuations in the sources. As an evocative example the\nmethod has then been applied to the case of an ideal observer moving as a point\non the surface of the Earth. The input have been the simulated arrival times of\nthe signals from four pulsars at the location of the Parkes radiotelescope in\nAustralia.

A rough application of the method to a three days run gives a\ncorrect result with a poor accuracy. The accuracy is then enhanced to the order\nof a few hundred meters if a continuous set of data is assumed. The method\ncould actually be used for navigation across the solar system and be based on\nartificial sources, rather than pulsars.

The\ndependence of snr on the area of the survey and the survey shot noise is also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 15:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2011 10:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
