We formulate\nthis within a probabilistic decision-theoretic framework. Our approach is\ncompared with related work by Robins and others: in particular, we show how\nRobins's 'G-computation' algorithm arises naturally from this\ndecision-theoretic perspective. Careful attention is paid to the mathematical\nand substantive conditions required to justify the use of this formula. These\nconditions revolve around a property we term stability, which relates the\nprobabilistic behaviours of observational and interventional regimes. We show\nhow an assumption of 'sequential randomization' (or 'no unmeasured\nconfounders'), or an alternative assumption of 'sequential irrelevance', can be\nused to infer stability. Probabilistic influence diagrams are used to simplify\nmanipulations, and their power and limitations are discussed. We compare our\napproach with alternative formulations based on causal DAGs or potential\nresponse models. We aim to show that formulating the problem of assessing\ndynamic treatment strategies as a problem of decision analysis brings clarity,\nsimplicity and generality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2010 16:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}

We study here\nthe combined problem of scheduling and power control, where we seek both an\nassignment of power settings and a partition of the links so that each set\nsatisfies the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) constraints.\n  We give an algorithm that attains an approximation ratio of $O(\\log n \\cdot\n\\log\\log \\Delta)$, where $n$ is the number of links and $\\Delta$ is the ratio\nbetween the longest and the shortest link length. Under the natural assumption\nthat lengths are represented in binary, this gives the first approximation\nratio that is polylogarithmic in the size of the input. The algorithm has the\ndesirable property of using an oblivious power assignment, where the power\nassigned to a sender depends only on the length of the link. We give evidence\nthat this dependence on $\\Delta$ is unavoidable, showing that any\nreasonably-behaving oblivious power assignment results in a $\\Omega(\\log\\log\n\\Delta)$-approximation.\n  These results hold also for the (weighted) capacity problem of finding a\nmaximum (weighted) subset of links that can be scheduled in a single time slot.\nIn addition, we obtain improved approximation for a bidirectional variant of\nthe scheduling problem, give partial answers to questions about the utility of\ngraphs for modeling physical interference, and generalize the setting from the\nstandard 2-dimensional Euclidean plane to doubling metrics. Finally, we explore\nthe utility of graph models in capturing wireless interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2010 16:34:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2011 12:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-19"}

Her constructions rely heavily on some\ntriangularity property of the product, but do not use explicitly that the\n0-Hecke algebra is a monoid algebra.\n  The thesis of this paper is that considering the general setting of monoids\nadmitting such a triangularity, namely J-trivial monoids, sheds further light\non the topic. This is a step to use representation theory to automatically\nextract combinatorial structures from (monoid) algebras, often in the form of\nposets and lattices, both from a theoretical and computational point of view,\nand with an implementation in Sage.\n  Motivated by ongoing work on related monoids associated to Coxeter systems,\nand building on well-known results in the semi-group community (such as the\ndescription of the simple modules or the radical), we describe how most of the\ndata associated to the representation theory (Cartan matrix, quiver) of the\nalgebra of any J-trivial monoid M can be expressed combinatorially by counting\nappropriate elements in M itself. As a consequence, this data does not depend\non the ground field and can be calculated in O(n^2), if not O(nm), where n=|M|\nand m is the number of generators. Along the way, we construct a triangular\ndecomposition of the identity into orthogonal idempotents, using the usual\nM\\\"obius inversion formula in the semi-simple quotient (a lattice), followed by\nan algorithmic lifting step.\n  Applying our results to the 0-Hecke algebra (in all finite types), we recover\npreviously known results and additionally provide an explicit labeling of the\nedges of the quiver. We further explore special classes of J-trivial monoids,\nand in particular monoids of order preserving regressive functions on a poset,\ngeneralizing known results on the monoids of nondecreasing parking functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2010 22:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 20:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2011 23:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-22"}

This latter population of galaxies\nis known as the backsplash population. Differentiating them from the infalling\npopulation presents an interesting challenge for observational studies of\ngalaxy evolution. To attempt to do this, we assemble a sample of 14 redshift-\nand spatially-isolated galaxy clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\nclean this sample of cluster-cluster mergers to ensure that the galaxies\ncontained within them are (to an approximation) only backsplashing from the\ncentre of their parent clusters and are not being processed in sub-clumps. By\nstacking them together to form a composite cluster, we find evidence for both\ncategories of galaxies at intermediate radii from the cluster centre.\nApplication of mixture modelling to this sample then serves to differentiate\nthe infalling galaxies (which we model on galaxies from the cluster outskirts)\nfrom the backsplash ones (which we model on galaxies in the high density core\nwith low velocity offsets from the cluster mean). We find that the fraction of\ngalaxies with populations similar to the low velocity cluster core galaxies is\nf = -0.052R/R_virial + 0.612 +/- 0.06 which we interpret as being the\nbacksplash population fraction at 1<R/R_virial<2.

They then\nmigrate inwards to their current observed orbital separations. Different\ntheories of how this migration occurs lead to varying distributions of orbital\neccentricity and the alignment between the rotation axis of the star and the\norbital axis of the planet. The spin-orbit alignment of a transiting system is\nrevealed via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which is the anomaly present in\nthe radial velocity measurements of the rotating star during transit due to the\nplanet blocking some of the starlight. In this paper we aim to measure the\nspin-orbit alignment of the WASP-3 system via a new way of analysing the\nRossiter-McLaughlin observations. We apply a new tomographic method for\nanalysing the time variable asymmetry of stellar line profiles caused by the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect.

We find a value for\nthe projected stellar spin rate of v sin i = 13.9 \\pm 0.03 km/s which is in\nagreement with previous measurements but has a much higher precision. The\nsystem is found to be well aligned which favours an evolutionary history for\nWASP-3b involving migration through tidal interactions with a protoplanetary\ndisc.

High resolution high speed videos (0.13 mm/pixel, 500 frames/second)\nof the dynamics of the impact were acquired. A few milliseconds after forming\nthe usually observed cavity, canopy and coronet (Prosperetti et al. 1993),\ndrops of diameters typically greater than 3.8 mm consistently generated\ntoroidal (donut-shaped) air bubbles upon impact at the water surface. Videos of\nthe dynamics of the impingement were successively taken from different angles,\nand with a 105 mm lens focused on different regions of the event. These allowed\nfor a qualitative description and hypothetical explanation of the observed\nphenomena, which are presented alongside the actual video footage, in the\nhereby displayed fluid dynamics video. The video displays a cartoon of the\nexperimental setup, followed by two simultaneously running videoclips of the\ndrop impact upon the water surface, from 2 different viewpoints (front and\ntop). As the event occurs over less than 1 second, the videos were slowed down\nto a frame rate of 12 frames/sec. The footage suggests that the air is trapped\nby the converging rim (or coronet) of the closing canopy. The very bottom of\nthe cavity then rises rapidly, and collides with the falling water mass\nprovided by the fully converged canopy rim. This incidentally prevents the\nformation of a secondary jet. The center (or donut hole) of the unstable\ntoroidal air bubble eventually moves outward, thus yielding a hemispherical air\nbubble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 09:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-19"}

We fully exploit the 3+1\nEulerian formalism, so that all the equations are written in terms of familiar\n3D vectors and tensors alone, we adopt spherical coordinates for the conformal\nbackground metric, and we consider axisymmetric spacetimes and fluid\nconfigurations. The GRMHD conservation laws are solved by means of\nshock-capturing methods within a finite-difference discretization, whereas, on\nthe same numerical grid, the Einstein elliptic equations are treated by\nresorting to spherical harmonics decomposition and solved, for each harmonic,\nby inverting band diagonal matrices. As a side product, we build and make\navailable to the community a code to produce GRMHD axisymmetric equilibria for\npolytropic relativistic stars in the presence of differential rotation and a\npurely toroidal magnetic field.

In order to study MC`evolution the self-similar approach method and a\nnumerical approach are used.

For Ising-like\nsystems without quenched disorder, $P_L(m)$ becomes scale invariant at the\ncritical point, where it assumes a characteristic bimodal shape featuring two\noverlapping peaks. In particular, the ratio between the value of $P_L(m)$ at\nthe peaks ($P_{L, max}$) and the value at the minimum in-between ($P_{L, min}$)\nbecomes $L$-independent at criticality. However, for Ising-like systems with\nquenched random fields, we argue that instead $\\Delta F_L := \\ln (P_{L, max} /\nP_{L, min}) \\propto L^\\theta$ should be observed, where $\\theta>0$ is the\n\"violation of hyperscaling\" exponent.

This is difficult to achieve\nwith the standard MHD numerical methods because they still have to deal with\nplasma inertial terms even when these terms are much smaller than the\nelectromagnetic terms.

It relies on\nMAC burst repetitions and on interference cancellation to increase the\nnormalized throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. CRDSA allows\nachieving a larger throughput than slotted ALOHA, at the price of an increased\naverage transmitted power. A way to trade-off the increment of the average\ntransmitted power and the improvement of the throughput is presented in this\npaper. Specifically, it is proposed to divide each MAC burst in k sub-bursts,\nand to encode them via a (n,k) erasure correcting code. The n encoded\nsub-bursts are transmitted over the MAC channel, according to specific\ntime/frequency-hopping patterns. Whenever n-e>=k sub-bursts (of the same burst)\nare received without collisions, erasure decoding allows recovering the\nremaining e sub-bursts (which were lost due to collisions). An interference\ncancellation process can then take place, removing in e slots the interference\ncaused by the e recovered sub-bursts, possibly allowing the correct decoding of\nsub-bursts related to other bursts. The process is thus iterated as for the\nCRDSA case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 14:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 07:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

Nevertheless,\nwhen one defines a differential equation on such a manifold, this theorem is\nalways ignored. For example, the differential formulation of Schrodinger\nequation is defined as a form so that a tangent vector is a product of\nHamiltonian and state vector. In this case, if the Hamiltonian and the state\nvector are both globally smooth functions on parameter space, then the tangent\nvector will be compelled to become smooth so that the Euler characteristic of\nthe parameter space must be zero. As a result, some Berry phases related to\nnon-zero Euler characteristic will be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 10:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2013 05:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

We\nshow herein that the emergent equations from the ASTG, under some critical\nconditions determined by the spin, do possess repulsive gravitational fields in\nthe polar regions of the gravitating body in question. This places the ASTG on\nan interesting pedestal to infer the origins of outflows as a repulsive\ngravitational phenomenon. Outflows are a ubiquitous phenomenon found in star\nforming systems and their true origin is a question yet to be settled. Given\nthe current thinking on their origin, the direction that the present paper\ntakes is nothing short of an asymptotic break from conventional wisdom; at the\nvery least, it is a complete paradigm shift because gravitation is not at all\nassociated with this process, but rather it is thought to be an all-attractive\nforce that only tries to squash matter together onto a single point.\nAdditionally, we show that the emergent Azimuthally Symmetric Gravitational\nField from the ASTG strongly suggests a solution to the supposed Radiation\nProblem that is thought to be faced by massive stars in their process of\nformation. That is, at about 8-10Msun radiation from the nascent star is\nexpected to halt the accretion of matter. We show that in-falling material will\nfall onto the equatorial disk and from there, this material will be channeled\nonto the forming star via the equatorial plane, thus accretion of mass\ncontinues well past the value of about 8-10Msun, albeit via the disk. Along the\nequatorial plane, the net force (with the radiation force included) on any\nmaterial there-on right up to the surface of the star is directed toward the\nforming star, hence accretion of mass by the nascent star is un-hampered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 06:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
