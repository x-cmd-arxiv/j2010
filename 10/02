Parameters of the\nsystem were derived from time-resolved optical spectral observations in the\nbright state that we obtained in Sep. 1998. The radial velocity semi-amplitude\nof the white dwarf (33.8 +/- 2.5 km/s) and corresponding mass function (f(M) =\n5.5 +/- 1.2 *10^{-4}~ M_sun) were derived from the motion of the emission\ncomponents of Balmer lines. The mass ratio q (\\approx 0.315) was evaluated from\nthe fractional period excess of the superhump period over the orbital period\n\\epsilon (\\approx 0.085), and a secondary mass range (0.18 - 0.38 M_sun) was\nestimated from the orbital period. Therefore, the white dwarf mass range is\n0.57 - 1.2 M_sun and the inclination angle of the system to the line of sight\nis 17 - 22.5 degrees. The adopted distance to the system is 335 +/- 50 pc. To\nfit the observed SED it is necessary to add a thermal spectrum with T \\approx\n11600 K and luminosity \\approx 0.4 L_disk to the accretion disc spectrum. This\ncombined spectrum successfully describes the observed Balmer lines absorption\ncomponents.

Unique features observed in the central core\nof MACSJ1931.8-2634 hint to a wealth of past activity that has greatly\ndisrupted the original cool core. We observe a spiral of relatively cool,\ndense, X-ray emitting gas connected to the cool core, as well as highly\nelongated intracluster light (ICL) surrounding the cD galaxy. Extended radio\nemission is observed surrounding the central AGN, elongated in the east-west\ndirection, spatially coincident with X-ray cavities. The power input required\nto inflate these `bubbles' is estimated from both the X-ray and radio emission\nto reside between 4 and 14e45 erg/s, putting it among the most powerful jets\never observed. This combination of a powerful AGN outburst and bulk motion of\nthe cool core have resulted in two X-ray bright ridges to form to the north and\nsouth of the central AGN at a distance of approximately 25 kpc. The northern\nridge has spectral characteristics typical of cool cores and is consistent with\nbeing a remnant of the cool core after it was disrupted by the AGN and bulk\nmotions. It is also the site of H-alpha filaments and young stars. The X-ray\nspectroscopic cooling rate associated with this ridge is approximately 165\nsolar masses/yr, which agrees with the estimate of the star formation rate from\nbroad-band optical imaging (170 solar masses/yr).

We\nfocus on recursion relations that arise from complex deformations of all\nexternal momenta. Under certain conditions, these \"all-line shift recursion\nrelations\" imply the MHV vertex expansion.

To\noptimize light and nutrient uptake, many microorganisms swim in directions\nbiased by environmental cues (e.g. phototaxis in algae and chemotaxis in\nbacteria). Such taxes inevitably lead to accumulations of cells, which, as many\nmicroorganisms have a density different to the fluid, can induce hydrodynamic\ninstabilites. The large-scale fluid flow and spectacular patterns that arise\nare termed bioconvection. However, the extent to which bioconvection is\naffected or suppressed by an imposed fluid flow, and how bioconvection\ninfluences the mean flow profile and cell transport are open questions. This\nexperimental study is the first to address these issues by quantifying the\npatterns due to suspensions of the gravitactic and gyrotactic green\nbiflagellate alga Chlamydomonas in horizontal tubes subject to an imposed flow.\nWith no flow, the dependence of the dominant pattern wavelength at pattern\nonset on cell concentration is established for three different tube diameters.\nFor small imposed flows, the vertical plumes of cells are observed merely to\nbow in the direction of flow. For sufficiently high flow rates, the plumes\nprogressively fragment into piecewise linear diagonal plumes, unexpectedly\ninclined at constant angles and translating at fixed speeds. The pattern\nwavelength generally grows with flow rate, with transitions at critical rates\nthat depend on concentration. Even at high imposed flow rates, bioconvection is\nnot wholly suppressed and perturbs the flow field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 20:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

Towards this goal, the present paper develops a\nspline-based approach to field estimation, which relies on a basis expansion\nmodel of the field of interest. The model entails known bases, weighted by\ngeneric functions estimated from the field's noisy samples. A novel field\nestimator is developed based on a regularized variational least-squares (LS)\ncriterion that yields finitely-parameterized (function) estimates spanned by\nthin-plate splines. Robustness considerations motivate well the adoption of an\novercomplete set of (possibly overlapping) basis functions, while a sparsifying\nregularizer augmenting the LS cost endows the estimator with the ability to\nselect a few of these bases that ``better'' explain the data. This parsimonious\nfield representation becomes possible, because the sparsity-aware spline-based\nmethod of this paper induces a group-Lasso estimator for the coefficients of\nthe thin-plate spline expansions per basis. A distributed algorithm is also\ndeveloped to obtain the group-Lasso estimator using a network of wireless\nsensors, or, using multiple processors to balance the load of a single\ncomputational unit. The novel spline-based approach is motivated by a spectrum\ncartography application, in which a set of sensing cognitive radios collaborate\nto estimate the distribution of RF power in space and frequency. Simulated\ntests corroborate that the estimated power spectrum density atlas yields the\ndesired RF state awareness, since the maps reveal spatial locations where idle\nfrequency bands can be reused for transmission, even when fading and shadowing\neffects are pronounced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 22:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Orbiting a quiet M-star, it receives considerably less mass-loss\ndriving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b, so that the interior may be quite\ndissimilar in composition, including the possibility of a large fraction of\nwater. We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock\ncore) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a\nmixture of H/He and H2O.

Motivated by failures\ncascading among electrical grids, we study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile\nmodel on two sparsely-coupled random regular graphs. By approximating\navalanches (cascades) as a multi-type branching process and using a\ngeneralization of Lagrange's expansion to multiple variables, we calculate the\ndistribution of avalanche sizes within each network. Due to coupling, large\navalanches in the individual networks are mitigated--in contrast to the\nconclusion for a simpler model [36]. Yet when compared to uncoupled networks,\ninterdependent networks more frequently suffer avalanches that are large in\nboth networks. Thus sparse connections between networks stabilize them\nindividually but destabilize them jointly, as coupling introduces reservoirs\nfor extra load yet also inflicts new stresses. These results suggest that in\npractice, to greedily mitigate large avalanches in one network, add connections\nbetween networks; conversely, to mitigate avalanches that are large in both\nnetworks, remove connections between networks. We also show that when only one\nnetwork receives load, the largest avalanches in the second network increase in\nsize and in frequency, an effect that is amplified with increased coupling\nbetween networks and with increased disparity in total capacity.

Buoyancy production at the moving\ninterface drives fluid motion, which in turn generates flow that advects the\nreaction front. As a consequence of this interplay between fluid flow and\nchemical reaction, autocatalytic plumes exhibit a rich dynamics during their\nascent through the reactant medium. One of the more interesting dynamical\nfeatures is the production of an accelerating vortical plume head that in\ncertain cases pinches-off and detaches from the upwelling conduit. After\npinch-off, a new plume head forms in the conduit below, and this can lead to\nmultiple generations of plume heads for a single plume initiation.

Furthermore, to\nestimate the best fit approximation parameter, we propose a distributive online\nstochastic learning algorithm using stochastic approximation theory. Finally,\nwe establish technical conditions for almost-sure convergence and show that\nunder heavy traffic, the proposed low complexity distributive control is global\noptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 03:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We summarize existing\ndecametre-wavelength observations of RRLs, which have detected only carbon\nRRLs. We then show that, for an interferometric array, the primary instrumental\nfactor limiting detection and study of the RRLs is the areal filling factor of\nthe array. We consider the Long Wavelength Array (LWA-1), the LOw Frequency\nARray (LOFAR), the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA-lo), and a future Lunar Radio Array (LRA), all of which will operate at\ndecametre wavelengths. These arrays offer digital signal processing, which\nshould produce more stable and better defined spectral bandpasses; larger\nfrequency tuning ranges; and better angular resolution than that of the\nprevious generation of instruments that have been used in the past for RRL\nobservations. Detecting Galactic carbon RRLs, with optical depths at the level\nof 10^-3, appears feasible for all of these arrays, with integration times of\nno more than 100 hr. The SKA-lo and LRA, and the LWA-1 and LOFAR at the lowest\nfrequencies, should have a high enough filling factor to detect lines with much\nlower optical depths, of order 10^-4 in a few hundred hours. The amount of\nRRL-hosting gas present in the Galaxy at the high Galactic latitudes likely to\nbe targeted in 21-cm cosmology studies is currently unknown.

The 3D geometry of these\nray-like features is largely unknown and its knowledge should clarify their\nassociation to the CS and place constraints on CME physics and coronal\nconditions. With this study we test these important implications for the first\ntime. An example of such a post-CME ray was observed by various coronagraphs,\nincluding these of the SECCHI instrument suite of the STEREO twin spacecraft\nand the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph LASCO onboard the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ray was observed in the aftermath of a CME\nwhich occurred on 9 April 2008. The twin STEREO spacecraft were separated by\nabout degrees on that day. This significant separation combined with a third\n\"eye\" view supplied by LASCO allow for a truly multi-viewpoint observation of\nthe ray and of the CME. We applied 3D forward geometrical modeling to the CME\nand to the ray as simultaneously viewed by SECCHI-A and B and by SECCHI-A and\nLASCO, respectively. We found that the ray can be approximated by a rectangular\nslab, nearly aligned with the CME axis, and much smaller than the CME in both\nterms of thickness and depth (~ 0.05 and 0.15 Rsun respectively). We found that\nthe ray and CME are significantly displaced from the associated post-CME\nflaring loops. The properties and location of the ray are fully consistent with\nthe expectations of the standard CME theories for post-CME current sheets.\nTherefore, our multi-viewpoint observations supply strong evidence that the\nobserved post-CME ray is indeed related to a post-CME current sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 11:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this situation various properties of $G$ are\nshown to be close to the corresponding properties of $C_G(H)$. By using\nClifford's theorem it is proved that the order $|G|$ is bounded in terms of\n$|H|$ and $|C_G(H)|$, the rank of $G$ is bounded in terms of $|H|$ and the rank\nof $C_G(H)$, and that $G$ is nilpotent if $C_G(H)$ is nilpotent. Lie ring\nmethods are used for bounding the exponent and the nilpotency class of $G$ in\nthe case of metacyclic $FH$. The exponent of $G$ is bounded in terms of $|FH|$\nand the exponent of $C_G(H)$ by using Lazard's Lie algebra associated with the\nJennings--Zassenhaus filtration and its connection with powerful subgroups. The\nnilpotency class of $G$ is bounded in terms of $|H|$ and the nilpotency class\nof $C_G(H)$ by considering Lie rings with a finite cyclic grading satisfying a\ncertain `selective nilpotency' condition. The latter technique also yields\nsimilar results bounding the nilpotency class of Lie rings and algebras with a\nmetacyclic Frobenius group of automorphisms, with corollaries for connected Lie\ngroups and torsion-free locally nilpotent groups with such groups of\nautomorphisms. Examples show that such nilpotency results are no longer true\nfor non-metacyclic Frobenius groups of automorphisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 14:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-18"}

In previous work, incentive conditions\nfor two users to cooperate using a simple version of Han-Kobayashi scheme was\nstudied and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) was used to obtain a fair\noperating point. Here a noncooperative bargaining game of alternating offers is\nadopted to model the bargaining process and rates resulting from the\nequilibrium outcome are analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the operating\npoint resulting from the formulated bargaining game depends on the cost of\ndelay in bargaining and how bargaining proceeds. If the associated bargaining\nproblem is regular, a unique perfect equilibrium exists and lies on the\nindividual rational efficient frontier of the achievable rate region. Besides,\nthe equilibrium outcome approaches the NBS if the bargaining costs of both\nusers are negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 15:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

Their\nquantitative analysis relied primarily on the \"disparity equivalence\"\napproximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral\ntranslation satisfies a strong (\"asymptotic\") approximation to binocular\ndisparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense\nthat it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension\nto peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central\nvision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic\nformula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where\nless precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the\nvision literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 19:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}
