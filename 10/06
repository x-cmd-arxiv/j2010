The metabolic network of any one organism is encoded by a\nmetabolic genotype, defined by a set of enzyme-coding genes whose products\ncatalyze the network's reactions. Each metabolic genotype has a metabolic\nphenotype, such as the ability to synthesize biomass on a spectrum of different\nsources of chemical elements and energy. We here focus on sulfur metabolism,\nwhich is attractive to study the evolution of metabolic networks, because it\ninvolves many fewer reactions than carbon metabolism. Specifically, we study\nproperties of the space of all possible metabolic genotypes, and analyze\nproperties of random metabolic genotypes that are viable on different numbers\nof sulfur sources. We show that metabolic genotypes with the same phenotype\nform large connected genotype networks that extend far through metabolic\ngenotype space. How far they reach through this space is a linear function of\nthe number of super-essential reactions in such networks, the number of\nreactions that occur in all networks with the same phenotype. We show that\ndifferent neighborhoods of any genotype network harbor very different novel\nphenotypes, metabolic innovations that can sustain life on novel sulfur\nsources. We also analyze the ability of evolving populations of metabolic\nnetworks to explore novel metabolic phenotypes. This ability is facilitated by\nthe existence of genotype networks, because different neighborhoods of these\nnetworks contain very different novel phenotypes. In contrast to\nmacromolecules, where phenotypic robustness may facilitate phenotypic\ninnovation, we show that here the ability to access novel phenotypes does not\nmonotonically increase with robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 16:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

In particular, for topological superconductors (or\nsuperfluids) with time-reversal symmetry which lack SU(2) spin rotation\nsymmetry (e.g. due to spin-orbit interactions), such as the B phase of $^3$He,\nthe thermal response is the only probe which can detect the non-trivial\ntopological character through transport. We show that, for such topological\nsuperconductors, applying a temperature gradient produces a thermal- (or mass-)\nsurface current perpendicular to the thermal gradient. Such charge, thermal, or\nmagnetic dipole responses provide a definition of topological insulators and\nsuperconductors beyond the single-particle picture. Moreover we find, for a\nsignificant part of the 'ten-fold' list of topological insulators found in\nprevious work in the absence of interactions, that in general dimensions the\neffective field theory describing the space-time responses is governed by a\nfield theory anomaly. Since anomalies are known to be insensitive to whether\nthe underlying fermions are interacting or not, this shows that the\nclassification of these topological insulators is robust to adiabatic\ndeformations by interparticle interactions in general dimensionality.

An examination of the\nbarycentric motion of exoplanet host stars, and their stellar activity cycles,\nhas the potential of proving or disproving the Sun's motion as an underlying\nfactor in the complex patterns of short- and long-term solar variability\nindices, by establishing whether such correlations exist in other planetary\nsystems. A variety of complex patterns of barycentric motions of exoplanet host\nstars is demonstrated, depending on the number, masses and orbits of the\nplanets. Each of the behavioural types proposed to correlate with solar\nactivity are also evident in exoplanet host stars: repetitive patterns\ninfluenced by massive multiple planets, epochs of rapid change in orbital\nangular momentum, and intervals of negative orbital angular momentum. The study\nprovides the basis for independent investigations of the widely-studied but\nunproven suggestion that the Sun's motion is somehow linked to various\nindicators of solar activity.

GRB080607 is a unique case of a highly extinguished (A_V~3 mag)\nafterglow that was yet sufficiently bright for high-quality absorption-line\nspectroscopy. The host galaxy is clearly resolved in deep HST WF3/IR F160W\nimages and well detected in the Spitzer IRAC 3.5 micron and 4.5 micron\nchannels, while displaying little/no fluxes in deep optical images from Keck\nand Magellan. The extremely red optical-infrared colors are consistent with the\nlarge extinction seen in the afterglow light, suggesting that the large amount\nof dust and gas surface mass density seen along the afterglow sightline is not\nmerely local but likely reflects the global dust content across the entire host\ngalaxy.

The maximum 2 -- 10\nkeV flux in the January and February flares was measured as 120 +- 10 mCrab and\n164 +- 17 mCrab respectively; the latter is the highest among those reported\nfrom the object. A comparison of the MAXI and Swift BAT data suggests a convex\nX-ray spectrum with an approximated photon index of about 2. This spectrum is\nconsistent with a picture that MAXI is observing near the synchrotron peak\nfrequency. The source exhibited a spectral variation during these flares,\nslightly different from those in the previous observations, in which the\npositive correlation between the flux and hardness was widely reported. By\nequating the halving decay timescale in the January flare, $t_{\\rm d} \\sim 2.5\n\\times 10^{4}$ s, to the synchrotron cooling time, the magnetic field was\nevaluated as B = 0.045 G $(\\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, where $\\delta$ is the jet\nbeaming factor.

Specifically, for the $K$-user cyclic Gaussian\ninterference channel, a compact representation of the Han-Kobayashi achievable\nrate region using Fourier-Motzkin elimination is first derived, a capacity\nregion outer bound is then established. It is shown that the Etkin-Tse-Wang\npower splitting strategy gives a constant gap of at most 2 bits in the weak\ninterference regime.

Further, based on the capacity results, this paper\nstudies the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric cyclic\ninterference channel.

We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural\nproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the\nthermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,\nif present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a\nsubstantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from\ncoronae in cluster environment. The total X-ray luminosity of a corona,\nhowever, depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and ram\npressures. These environment dependences should at least partly explain the\nlarge dispersion in the observed diffuse X-ray luminosities of spheroids with\nsimilar stellar properties.

Since a racemic mixture of chiral\nnucleotides frustrates the extension and replication of RNA and DNA,\nunderstanding the origin of homochirality has important implications to the\ninvestigation of the origin of life. Here we suggest a novel solution to the\nhomochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation\ntheory for the origin of life. Homochirality is suggested to have been\nincorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right-\nover left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean\nsea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of\nRNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the\nsomewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late\nafternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular\ndichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of\nRNA/DNA. A numerical model is presented demonstrating the efficacy of such a\nmechanism in procuring 100% homochirality of RNA or DNA from an original\nracemic solution in less than 500 Archean years assuming a photon absorption\nthreshold for replication representing the hydrogen bonding energies between\ncomplimentary strands. Because cholesteric D-nucleic acids have greater\naffinity for L-amino acids due to a positive structural complementarity, and\nbecause D-RNA/DNA+L-amino acid complexes also have a negative circular\ndichroism band between 200 - 300 nm, the homochirality of amino acids can also\nbe explained by the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 04:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-07"}

The next generation of radio telescope arrays such as the Allen\nTelescope Array (ATA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) have key science\ngoals that involve making large mosaicked observations filled with bright point\nsources. We present a new method for calibrating the shape of the telescope's\nmean primary beam that uses the multiple redundant observations of these bright\nsources in the mosaic. The method has an analytical solution for simple\nGaussian beam shapes but can also be applied to more complex beam shapes\nthrough $\\chi^2$ minimization. One major benefit of this simple, conceptually\nclean method is that it makes use of the science data for calibration purposes,\nthus saving telescope time and improving accuracy through simultaneous\ncalibration and observation. We apply the method both to 1.43 GHz data taken\nduring the ATA Twenty Centimeter Survey (ATATS) and to 3.14 GHz data taken\nduring the ATA's Pi Gigahertz Sky Survey (PiGSS). We find that the beam's\ncalculated full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are consistent with the\ntheoretical values, the values measured by several independent methods, and the\nvalues from the simulation we use to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod on data from future telescopes such as the expanded ATA and the SKA.\nThese results are preliminary, and can be expanded upon by fitting more complex\nbeam shapes. We also investigate, by way of a simulation, the dependence of the\naccuracy of the telescope's FWHM on antenna number. We find that the\nuncertainty returned by our fitting method is inversely proportional to the\nnumber of antennas in the array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 05:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Given\nits large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution\nmodels. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating\nsolar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to\nprovide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand\nwhether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on\nthe inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We\ncombine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available\nspectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the\nsystem parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling\n(including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10%\nreduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions\nare found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet\na mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at\nleast 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and\nsignificant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main\nsequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is\n1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young\nsolutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then\nbe matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state,\nprovided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to\nusual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in\nany case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the\nresult of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with\nanother Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system\nwhich caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid\ncircularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2\nthat could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess\nand the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The\ndetermination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and\nsecondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's\natmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a\nmanner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 07:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}

One theme that\nemerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column\noffsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are\ncommon. We then discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our own\ninvestigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 08:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-07"}

Currently, the\nbest-known results for synchronization for single-hop networks of $m$\nprocessors is a randomized algorithm due to \\cite{BKO09} of O(\\sqrt {n /m}\n\\cdot poly-log(n)) awake times per processor and a lower bound of\nOmega(\\sqrt{n/m}) of the number of awake times needed per processor\n\\cite{BKO09}.

Therefore,\nour algorithm is {optimal} in terms of energy efficiency and completely\nresolves a long sequence of works in this area. In order to achieve these\nresults we devise a novel {adaptive} technique that determines the times when\ndevices power their radios on and off. In addition, we prove several lower\nbounds on the energy efficiency of algorithms for {multi-hop networks}.\nSpecifically, we show that any algorithm for multi-hop networks must have radio\nuse of Omega(\\sqrt n) per processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 10:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

A 2D relativistic PIC\nsimulation models the collision of two plasma clouds, in the presence of a\nquasi-parallel magnetic field. The cloud density ratio is 10. The densities of\nions & electrons & the temperature of 131 keV are equal in each cloud. The mass\nratio is 250.

The magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial plasma flow\ndirection is amplified to values that exceed those expected from shock\ncompression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is\nquasi-perpendicular due to this amplification, caused by a current sheet which\ndevelops in response to the differing deflection of the incoming upstream\nelectrons & ions. The electron deflection implies a charge separation of the\nupstream electrons & ions; the resulting electric field drags the electrons\nthrough the magnetic field, whereupon they acquire a relativistic mass\ncomparable to the ions.

We model the star as consisting of a mixture of neutrons,\nprotons and electrons, and allow for particle reactions and binary collisions\nbetween species. Our analysis is in much the same spirit as that of Goldreich &\nReisenegger (1992), and we content ourselves with rough estimates of magnetic\ndiffusion timescales, rather than solving accurately for some particular field\ngeometry. However, our work improves upon previous treatments in one crucial\nrespect: we allow for superfluidity in the neutron star matter. We find that\nthe consequent mutual friction force, coupling the neutrons and charged\nparticles, together with the suppression of particles collisions and reactions,\ndrastically affect the ambipolar magnetic field diffusion timescale. In\nparticular, the addition of superfluidity means that it is unlikely that there\nis ambipolar diffusion in magnetar cores on the timescale of the lifetimes of\nthese objects, contradicting an assumption often made in the modelling of the\nflaring activity commonly observed in magnetars. Our work suggests that if a\ndecaying magnetic field is indeed the cause of magnetar activity, the field\nevolution is likely to take place outside of the core, and might represent\nHall/Ohmic diffusion in the stellar crust, or else that a mechanism other than\nstandard ambipolar diffusion is active, e.g. flux expulsion due to the\ninteraction between neutron vortices and magnetic fluxtubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 13:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 09:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 15:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
