This transport produces mid-tropospheric minima in\nquantities such as water vapor and moist static energy and maxima where the\nclouds detrain.

Observations of elevated dust layers on Mars further support the\nnotion that non-local deep transport is an important mechanism in the\natmosphere of Mars. On Titan, the presence of deep convective clouds almost\nassures that non-local, deep transport is occurring and these clouds may play a\nrole in global cycling of energy, momentum, and methane.

The nonlinear behavior of the plasma\nat small scale is described by using a MHD shell model for velocity field and\nmagnetic field fluctuations.The shell model allow to study this problem in a\nlarge parameter regime which characterizes the dynamo phenomenon in many\nnatural systems and which is beyond the power of supercomputers at today. Under\nspecific conditions of the plasma turbulent state, the field fluctuations at\nsmall scales are able to trigger the dynamo instability. We study this\ntransition considering the stability curve which shows a strong decrease in the\ncritical magnetic Reynolds number for increasing inverse magnetic Prandlt\nnumber $\\textrm{Pm}^{-1}$ in the range $[10^{-6},1]$ and slows an increase in\nthe range $[1,10^{8}]$. We also obtain hysteretic behavior across the dynamo\nboundary reveling the subcritical nature of this transition. The system,\nundergoing this transition, can reach different dynamo regimes, depending on\nReynolds numbers of the plasma flow. This shows the critical role that the\nturbulence plays in the dynamo phenomenon. In particular the model is able to\nreproduce the dynamical situation in which the large-scale magnetic field jumps\nbetween two states which represent the opposite polarities of the magnetic\nfield, reproducing the magnetic reversals as observed in geomagnetic dynamo and\nin the VKS experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 18:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

Although the plant response to\nenvironmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional\nplasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics\nmodels have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models\nwithout architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x\nenvironment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study\nintroducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives\naccess to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection\nand thus to promising tools for yield optimization. Methods: The GreenLab model\nwas selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL.\nVirtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic\nmodel that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model.\nThe QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated\nplant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for\nyield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic\ncombination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors\nconstant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals\ngenerated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be\nsimulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits\n- such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to\nbe more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is\nillustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype)\nassociated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper\ndiscusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype\ninteractions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of\nbiomass supply over demand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 19:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

Recent mm-wave VLBI and radio timing observations as well as\nnumerical GRMHD simulations now have provided several breakthroughs that put\nSgr A* back into the focus. Firstly, VLBI observations have now measured the\nintrinsic size of Sgr A* at multiple frequencies, where the highest frequency\nmeasurements have approached the scale of the black hole shadow. Moreover,\nmeasurements of the radio variability show a clear time lag between 22 GHz and\n43 GHz. The combination of size and timing measurements, allows one to actually\nmeasure the flow speed and direction of magnetized plasma at some tens of\nSchwarzschild radii. This data strongly support a moderately relativistic\noutflow, consistent with an accelerating jet model. This is compared to recent\nGRMHD simulation that show the presence of a moderately relativistic outflow\ncoupled to an accretion flow Sgr A*. Further VLBI and timing observations\ncoupled to simulations have the potential to map out the velocity profile from\n5-40 Schwarzschild radii and to provide a first glimpse at the appearance of a\njet-disk system near the event horizon. Future submm-VLBI experiments would\neven be able to directly image those processes in strong gravity and directly\nconfirm the presence of an event horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2010 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

To address this issue, we have observed eight apparently\nisolated OB stars in the SMC using HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Five of\nthese objects appear as isolated stars, two of which are confirmed to be\nrunaways. The remaining three objects are found to exist in sparse clusters,\nwith <10 companion stars revealed, having masses of 1-4 solar mass. Stochastic\neffects dominate in these sparse clusters, so we perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations to explore how our observations fit within the framework of\nempirical, galactic cluster properties. We generate clusters using a simplistic\n-2 power-law distribution for either the number of stars per cluster (N_*) or\ncluster mass (M_cl). These clusters are then populated with stars randomly\nchosen from a Kroupa IMF. We find that simulations with cluster lower-mass\nlimits of M_cl,lo >20 solar mass and N_*,lo >40 match best with observations of\nSMC and Galactic OB star populations.

These results suggest that clusters are built stochastically by\nrandomly sampling stars from a universal IMF with a fixed stellar upper-mass\nlimit.

RM variance on an angular scale of 1 degree is\ncorrelated with length of the line of sight through the Galaxy, with a\ncontribution from local structures. The slope of the SFs is less concentrated\nto the Galactic plane and less correlated with length of the line of sight\nthrough the Galaxy, suggesting a more local origin for RM structure on angular\nscales ~ 10 degrees. The RM variance is a factor ~2 higher towards the SGP than\ntowards the NGP, reflecting a more wide-spread asymmetry between the northern\nand southern Galactic hemispheres.

The foamy structures are\nprovided by lower-dimensional background brane defects in a D3-brane Universe,\nwhose density is a free parameter to be constrained phenomenologically. Such\nconstraining can be provided by high energy gamma-ray photon tests, including\nultra-high energy/infrared photon-photon scattering. In the second part, I\nanalyze the currently available data from MAGIC and FERMI Telescopes on delayed\ncosmic photon arrivals in this context. It is understood of course that\nconventional Astrophysics source effects, which currently are far from being\nunderstood, might be the dominant reason for the observed delayed arrivals. I\nalso discuss how the stringent constraints from studies of\nsynchrotron-radiation from distant Nebulae, absence of cosmic birefringence and\nnon observation of ultra-high-energy cosmic photons can be accommodated within\nthe aforementioned stringy space-time foam model. I argue that, at least within\nthe currently available sets of astrophysical data, the stringy foam model can\navoid all theses constraints in a natural range of the string coupling and mass\nscale. The key features are: (i) transparency of the foam to electrons and\ncharged probes in general, (ii) absence of birefringence effects and (iii) a\nbreakdown of the local effective lagrangian formalism. However, in order to\naccommodate, in this theoretical framework, the data of the FERMI satellite on\nthe delayed arrival of photons from the short intense Gamma Ray Burst GRB\n090510, in a way consistent with the findings of the MAGIC telescope, a non\nuniform density of brane foam defects must be invoked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 10:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}

Several empirical prescriptions have been\nproposed, trying to express the mass-loss rate (Mdot) as a function of\nfundamental stellar parameters (mass, luminosity, effective temperature). Our\ngoal is to test whether the de Jager et al. (1988) prescription, used in some\nstellar evolution models, is still valid in view of more recent mass-loss\ndeterminations. By considering 40 Galactic RSGs presenting an infrared excess\nand an IRAS 60-mu flux larger than 2 Jy, and assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio\nof 200, it is found that the de Jager rate agrees within a factor 4 with most\nMdot estimates based on the 60-mu signal. It is also in agreement with 6 of the\nonly 8 Galactic RSGs for which Mdot can be measured more directly through\nobservations of the circumstellar gas. The two objects that do not follow the\nde Jager prescription (by an order of magnitude) are mu Cep and NML Cyg. We\nhave also considered the RSGs of the Magellanic Clouds. Thanks to the works of\nGroenewegen et al. (2009) and Bonanos et al. (2010), we find that the RSGs of\nthe SMC have Mdots consistent with the de Jager rate scaled by\n(Z/Zsun)**(alpha), where Z is the metallicity and alpha is 0.7. The situation\nis less clear for the LMC RSGs. In particular, for luminosties larger than\n1.6E+05 Lsun, one finds numerous RSGs (except WOH-G64) having Mdot\nsignificantly smaller than the de Jager rate, and indicating that Mdot would no\nlonger increase with L. Before this odd situation is confirmed through further\nanalysis of LMC RSGs, we suggest to keep the de Jager prescription unchanged at\nsolar metallicity in the stellar evolutionary models and to apply a\n(Z/Zsun)**0.7 dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 11:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Currently, a large range of Newtonian\nrelaxation, or \"cooling\", times (~10 days to ~1 hour) is used among different\nmodels and within a single model over the model domain. In this study we\ndemonstrate that a short relaxation time (much less than the planetary rotation\ntime) leads to a large amount of unphysical, grid-scale oscillations that\ncontaminate the flow field. These oscillations force the use of an excessive\namount of artificial viscosity to quench them and prevent the simulation from\n\"blowing up\". Even if the blow-up is prevented, such simulations can be highly\ninaccurate because they are either severely over-dissipated or\nunder-dissipated, and are best discarded in these cases. Other numerical\nstability and timestep size enhancers (e.g., Robert-Asselin filter or\nsemi-implicit time-marching schemes) also produce similar, but less excessive,\ndamping.

We exploited the spectral archive of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create a sample of more than 9000 quasars in the\nStripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve\nCatalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and individual first-order structure functions\nwere computed. The structure functions are used to create a variability\nindicator that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (1\nto 2 yr in the rest frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS\nfilter bands as a function of redshift. While variability is almost always\nstronger in the bluer passband compared to the redder, the variability ratio\ndepends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the\nother. The variability ratio-redshift relations resemble the corresponding\ncolour index-redshift relations. From the comparison with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of variable quasar spectra we find that the observed variability\nratio-redshift relations are closely fitted assuming that (a) the r.m.s.\nfluctuation of the quasar continuum follows a power law-dependence on the\nintrinsic wavelength with an exponent -2 (i.e., bluer when brighter) and (b)\nthe variability of the emission line flux is only about 10% of that of the\nunderlying continuum. These results, based upon the photometry of more than\n8000 quasars, confirm the previous findings by Wilhite et al. (2005) from 315\nquasars with repeated SDSS spectroscopy. Finally, we find that quasars with\nunusual spectra and weak emission lines tend to have less variability than\nconventional quasars.

Any observed X-ray\nflux from on-disc sources is composed of direct emission plus Compton\nbackscattered photons (albedo). This affects both the observed spectra and\nimages as well as the physical quantities derived from them such as the spatial\nand spectral distributions of accelerated electrons or characteristics of the\nsolar atmosphere. Aims: We propose a new indirect method to measure albedo and\nto infer the directivity of X-rays in imaging using RHESSI data. Methods:\nVisibility forward fitting is used to determine the size of a disc event\nobserved by RHESSI as a function of energy. This is compared to the sizes of\nsimulated sources from a Monte Carlo simulation code of photon transport in the\nchromosphere for different degrees of downward directivity and true source\nsizes to find limits on the true source size and the directivity. Results: The\nobserved full width half maximum of the source varies in size between 7.4\narcsec and 9.1 arcsec with the maximum between 30 and 40 keV. Such behaviour is\nexpected in the presence of albedo and is found in the simulations. A source\nsize smaller than 6 arcsec is improbable for modest directivities and the true\nsource size is likely to be around 7 arcsec for small directivities.\nConclusions: While it is difficult to image the albedo patch directly, the\neffect of backscattered photons on the observed source size can be estimated.\nThe increase in source size caused by albedo has to be accounted for when\ncomputing physical quantities that include the size as a parameter such as\nflare energetics. At the same time, the study of the albedo signature provides\nvital information about the directivity of X-rays and related electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 13:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The theory is based on the eigendecomposition (EID) of\nthe operator, given by the difference of the weighted density operators, namely\nD = q1r1-q0r0. In general, this EID is obtained explicitly only with pure\nstates, whereas with mixed states it must be carried out numerically. In this\nletter we show that the same evaluation can be performed on the basis of a\nmodified version of the Gram matrix. The advantage is due to the fact that the\nouter products of density operators are replaced by inner product, with a\nconsiderable dimensionality reduction. At the limit, in quantum optical\ncommunications the density operators have infinite dimensions, whereas the\ninner products are simply scalar quantities. The Gram matrix approach permits\nthe explicit (not numerical) evaluation of a binary system performance in cases\nnot previously developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 13:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts. Indeed, if the symmetry energy is supersoft, the surface\ncontribution becomes dominant. We note that the linear correlation of NST of\n208Pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from\nthe bulk part of NST. We also note that most models predict a mixed-type\n(between halo and skin) neutron distribution for 208Pb.

The theoretical models predict\nmodifications to the radiation dispersion relations, which are quadratically\nsuppressed by the string mass scale, and time delays in the arrival times of\nphotons (assumed to be emitted more or less simultaneously from the source),\nwhich are proportional to the photon energy, so that the more energetic photons\narrive later.

The problem of predecessors is finding\nthe probability that a path along the oriented bonds passes sequentially fixed\nsites $i$ and $j$. The conformal field theory for the Potts model predicts the\nfractal dimension of the path to be 5/4. Using this result, we show that the\nprobability in the predecessors problem for two sites separated by large\ndistance $r$ decreases as $P(r) \\sim r^{-3/4}$. If sites $i$ and $j$ are\nnearest neighbors on the square lattice, the probability $P(1)=5/16$ can be\nfound from the analytical theory developed for the sandpile model. The known\nequivalence between the loop erased random walk (LERW) and the directed path on\nthe spanning tree says that $P(1)$ is the probability for the LERW started at\n$i$ to reach the neighboring site $j$. By analogy with the self-avoiding walk,\n$P(1)$ can be called the return probability.

We may think of x as a trap, and tau_x as the depth of the trap\nat x. We are interested in the trap process, namely the process that associates\nto time t the depth of the currently visited trap. Our first result is the\nconvergence of the law of that process under suitable scaling. The limit\nprocess is given by the jumps of a certain alpha-stable subordinator at the\ninverse of another alpha-stable subordinator, correlated with the first\nsubordinator.
