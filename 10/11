According to the conditions that the structure constants\n(deformation parameters) should satisfy, we argue that there are two types of\nnoncommutative phase space with Lie-algebraic structure. The exact classical\nsolutions in commutative and type I noncommutative cases are presented. In the\nframework of this type of deformed phase space, we investigate the possibility\nof building a Bianchi I model with cyclic scale factors in which the size of\nthe universe in each direction experiences an endless sequence of contractions\nand re-expansions. We also obtain some approximate solutions for the type II\nnoncommutative structure by numerical methods and show that the cyclic behavior\nis repeated as well. These results are compared with the standard commutative\ncase, and similarities and differences of these solutions are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 16:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 18:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We identify 47 distinct\nstar clusters with the application of the nearest-neighbor density method to\nthis catalog for a detection threshold of 3sigma above the average stellar\ndensity. The size distribution of the detected clusters can be very well\napproximated by a Gaussian with a peak at ~ 68 pc. Their cluster mass function\nis fitted very well by a power-law with index alpha ~ 1.5 +/- 0.7, consistent\nwith other Local Group galaxies and the cluster initial mass function. The\napplication of the nearest-neighbor density method for various density\nthresholds, other than 3sigma, enabled the identification of stellar\nconcentrations in various length-scales. The stellar density maps constructed\nwith this technique provide a direct proof of hierarchically structured stellar\nconcentrations in NGC 6822. We illustrate this hierarchy by the so-called\n\"dendrogram\" of the detected stellar structures, which demonstrates that most\nof the detected structures split up into several substructures over at least\nthree levels. We quantify the hierarchy of these structures with the use of the\nminimum spanning tree method. The morphological hierarchy in stellar\nclustering, which we observe in NGC 6822 resembles that of the turbulent\ninterstellar matter, suggesting that turbulence on pc- and kpc-scales has been\nprobably the major agent that regulated clustered star formation in NGC 6822.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 16:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

If the constraints are monotone (the two\nvariables appear with opposite sign coefficients) then the problems of\nsubmodular minimization or supermodular maximization are polynomial time\nsolvable. The key idea is to link these problems to a submodular s,t-cut\nproblem defined here. This framework includes the problems: SM-vertex cover;\nSM-2SAT; SM-min satisfiability; SM-edge deletion for clique, SM-node deletion\nfor biclique and others. We also introduce here the submodular closure problem\nand and show that it is solvable in polynomial time and equivalent to the\nsubmodular cut problem.

For\ntemperature systematics we consider gain fluctuation and beam distortions. For\npolarization we consider effects related to known instrumental systematics:\ncalibration, pixel rotation, differential gain, pointing, and ellipticity of\nthe instrument beam. We consider these effects at next to leading order, which\nwe refer to as non-linear systematic effects. We find that if the instrumental\nresponse is linearly proportional to the received CMB intensity, then only the\nshape of the primordial CMB bispectrum, if there is any, will be distorted. We\nshow that the nonlinear response of the instrument can in general result in\nspurious non-Gaussian features on both the CMB temperature and polarization\nanisotropies, even if the primordial CMB is completely Gaussian. We determine\nthe level for both the linear and non-linear systematics parameters for which\nthey would cause no significant degradation of our ability to constrain the\nprimordial non-Gaussianity amplitude f_{nl}. We find that the non-linear\nsystematics are potentially bigger worry for extracting the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity than the linear systematics. Especially because the current and\nnear future CMB probes are optimized for CMB power-spectrum measurements which\nare not particularly sensitive to the non-linear instrument response. We find\nthat if instrumental non-linearities are not controlled by dedicated\ncalibration, the effective local non-Gaussianity can be as large as f_{nl} ~\nO(10) before the corresponding non-linearities show up in the CMB dipole\nmeasurements. The higher order multipoles are even less sensitive to\ninstrumental non-linearities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 19:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-07"}

We use synthetic spectral templates with a variety of simple\nparametric star formation histories to fit broadband spectral energy\ndistributions. These parametric models are used to infer ages, star formation\nrates and stellar masses for a mock data set drawn from a hierarchical\nsemi-analytic model of galaxy evolution. Traditional parametric models\ngenerally assume an exponentially declining rate of star-formation after an\ninitial instantaneous rise. Our results show that star formation histories with\na much more gradual rise in the star formation rate are likely to be better\ntemplates, and are likely to give better overall estimates of the age\ndistribution and star formation rate distribution of Lyman break galaxies. For\nB- and V-dropouts, we find the best simple parametric model to be one where the\nstar formation rate increases linearly with time. The exponentially-declining\nmodel overpredicts the age by 100 % and 120 % for B- and V-dropouts, on\naverage, while for a linearly-increasing model, the age is overpredicted by 9 %\nand 16 %, respectively.

This work extends our\nprevious studies that explored the cases of low-mass perturbers on circular\norbits and massive perturbers on straight-line trajectories. The background\nmedium is assumed to be non-rotating, adiabatic with index 5/3, and uniform\nwith density rho0 and sound speed a0. We model the gravitating perturber using\na Plummer sphere with mass Mp and softening radius rs in a uniform circular\nmotion at speed Vp and orbital radius Rp, and run various models with differing\nR=rs/Rp, Mach=Vp/a0, and B=G*Mp/(a0^2*Rp). A quasi-steady density wake of a\nsupersonic model consists of a hydrostatic envelope surrounding the perturber,\nan upstream bow shock, and a trailing low-density region. The continuous change\nin the direction of the perturber motion makes the detached shock distance\nreduced compared to the linear-trajectory cases, while the orbit-averaged\ngravity of the perturber gathers the gas toward the center of the orbit,\nmodifying the background preshock density to rho1=(1 + 0.46B)*rho0 depending\nweakly on Mach. For sufficiently massive perturbers, the presence of a\nhydrostatic envelope makes the drag force smaller than the prediction of the\nlinear perturbation theory, resulting in F = 4*pi*rho1*(G*Mp/Vp)^2 * (0.7/etaB)\nfor etaB = B/(Mach^2 -1) > 0.1; the drag force for low-mass perturbers with\netaB < 0.1 agrees well with the linear prediction. The nonlinear drag force\nbecomes independent of R as long as R < etaB/2, which places an upper limit on\nthe perturber size for accurate evaluation of the drag force in numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 04:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The first\napproach, which we will call the contravariant approach, was originally\nproposed by Isham and Butterfield, and was later extended by Doering and Isham.\nThe second approach, which we will call the covariant approach, was developed\nby Heunen, Landsman and Spitters. Motivated by coarse-graining and the\nKochen-Specker theorem, the contravariant approach uses the topos of presheaves\non a specific context category, defined as the poset of commutative von Neumann\nsubalgebras of some given von Neumann algebra. In particular, the approach uses\nthe spectral presheaf. The intuitionistic logic of this approach is given by\nthe (complete) Heyting algebra of closed open subob jects of the spectral\npresheaf. We show that this Heyting algebra is, in a natural way, a locale in\nthe ambient topos, and compare this locale with the internal Gelfand spectrum\nof the covariant approach. In the covariant approach, a non-commutative\nC*-algebra (in the topos Set) defines a commutative C*-algebra internal to the\ntopos of covariant functors from the context category to the category of sets.\nWe give an explicit description of the internal Gelfand spectrum of this\ncommutative C*-algebra, from which it follows that the external spectrum is\nspatial. Using the daseinisation of self-adjoint operators from the\ncontravariant approach, we give a new definition of the daseinisation arrow in\nthe covariant approach and compare it with the original version. States and\nstate-proposition pairing in both approaches are compared. We also investigate\nthe physical interpretation of the covariant approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 08:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2011 12:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

After careful consideration of any\nsystematic effects, we find that the neutral gas consists of less than ~10% of\nthe total gas, and this limit decreases with the more ionised that the X-ray\nabsorbing gas is, which in our spectral fits is assumed to be neutral. Only a\nvery small fraction of this ionised gas, however, is detected in UV absorption\nlines with ionisation potentials up to ~200eV (i.e. SiIV, CIV, NV, OVI), which\nleaves us to postulate that the X-ray excess is due to ultra-highly-ionised,\ndense gas in the GRB vicinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 08:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Based on this, the\nequivalent width (EW) of [OIII] should provide a direct measure of theta. Here\nwe analyze the distribution of EW([OIII]) in a sample of ~6,000 SDSS quasars,\nand find that it can be accurately reproduced assuming a relatively small\nintrinsic scatter and a random distribution of inclination angles. This result\nhas several implications: 1) it is a direct proof of the disc-like emission of\nthe optical continuum of quasars; 2) the value of EW([OIII]) can be used as a\nproxy of the inclination, to correct the measured continuum emission and then\nestimate the bolometric luminosity of quasars; 3) the presence of almost\nedge-on discs among broad line quasars implies that the accretion disc is not\naligned with the circumnuclear absorber, and/or that the covering fraction of\nthe latter is rather small.

One possible\nrelationship between these two notions of space was unearthed by Banaschewski\nand Mulvey, who proved a constructive version of Gelfand duality in which the\nGelfand spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra comes out as a pointfree space.\nBeing constructive, this result applies in arbitrary toposes (with natural\nnumbers objects, so that internal C*-algebras can be defined). Earlier work by\nthe first three authors, shows how a noncommutative C*-algebra gives rise to a\ncommutative one internal to a certain sheaf topos. The latter, then, has a\nconstructive Gelfand spectrum, also internal to the topos in question.

However, we obtain the external\nspectrum as a fibered topological space in the usual sense.

However, the Compton-thick\nAGN (NH>1e24 cm^-2) population is basically unconstrained, with less than few\ndozen confirmed Compton-thick AGN found and studied so far. A way to select\nheavily obscured AGN is to compare the X-ray emission below 10 keV (which is\nstrongly depressed) with the emission from other bands less affected by the\nabsorption, i.e. the IR band. To this end, we have cross-correlated the 2XMM\ncatalogue with the IRAS Point Source catalogue and, by using the X-ray to\ninfrared flux ratio and X-ray colors, we selected a well defined sample of\nCompton-thick AGN candidates at z<0.1.

To this end we\nobtained deep (100 ks) Suzaku observations (AO4 call) and performed a joint fit\nwith SWIFT-BAT data. We analyzed XMM-Newton, Suzaku and SWIFT-BAT data and we\npresent here the results of this broad-band (0.4-100 keV) spectral analysis.

In particular, the most\nprobable scenario is that of a mildly (NH (1.3-1.5)x1e24 cm^-2, L(2-10 keV)\n(5-7)x1e43 erg s^-1) Compton-thick AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 12:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

I inverted the\nspectra of five photospheric lines with a model that mimicked vertically\ninterlaced magnetic fields with two components, labeled background field and\nflow channels. The flow channels were modeled as a perturbation of the\nbackground field with a Gaussian shape using the SIRGAUS code. The location and\nextension of the Gaussian perturbation in the optical depth scale was then\nconverted to a geometrical height scale. I investigated the relative amount of\nmagnetic flux in the flow channels and the background field atmosphere. The\nuncombed model is able to reproduce the NCP well on the limb side of the spot\nand worse on the center side; the VIS lines are better reproduced than the\nnear-IR lines. The Evershed flow happens along nearly horizontal field lines\nclose to the solar surface. The magnetic flux that is related to the flow\nchannels makes up about 20-50% of the total magnetic flux in the penumbra. The\ngradients obtainable by a Gaussian perturbation are too small for a perfect\nreproduction of the NCP in the IR lines with their small formation height\nrange. Two peculiarities of the observed NCP, a sign change of the NCP of the\nVIS lines on the center side and a ring structure around the umbra in the Ti\nline at 630.37nm and the FeI line at 1565.2nm deserve closer attention.

Recently it has\nbeen introduced into evolutionary game theory. In evolutionary game dynamics,\nthe probability to be imitated or to reproduce depends on the performance in a\ngame. The influence of the game on the stochastic dynamics in finite\npopulations is governed by the intensity of selection. In many models of both\nunstructured and structured populations, a key assumption allowing analytical\ncalculations is weak selection, which means that all individuals perform\napproximately equally well. In the weak selection limit many different\nmicroscopic evolutionary models have the same or similar properties. How\nuniversal is weak selection for those microscopic evolutionary processes? We\nanswer this question by investigating the fixation probability and the average\nfixation time not only up to linear, but also up to higher orders in selection\nintensity. We find universal higher order expansions, which allow a rescaling\nof the selection intensity. With this, we can identify specific models which\nviolate (linear) weak selection results, such as the one--third rule of\ncoordination games in finite but large populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 13:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-15"}

This is because, once the growth of a condensation becomes non-linear,\nit tends to be growing non-competitively from its own essentially separate\nreservoir; we call this Oligarchic Accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 15:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A two-dimensional conservation law\ndescribes the age and maturity structuration of the follicular cell\npopulations. The densities intersect through a coupled hyperbolic system\nbetween different follicles and cell phases, which results in a vector\nconservation law and coupling boundary conditions.

We use intermediate\nresolution spectra, obtained with WHT in December 2008, when GR290 was at\nminimum (V = 18.6), as well as new low resolution spectra and B V R I\nphotometry obtained with the Loiano and Cima Ekar telescopes during 2007-2010.\nWe identify more than 80 emission lines in the 3100-10000 A range, belonging to\ndifferent species and to forbidden transitions. Many lines, especially the HeI\ntriplets, show a P Cygni profile with an a-e radial velocity difference from\n-300 to -500 km/s. The shape of the 4630-4713 A emission blend and of other\nemission lines resembles that of WN9 stars; the blend deconvolution shows that\nthe HeII 4686 A has a strong broad component with FWHM \\simeq 1700 km/s. During\n2003-2010 the star underwent large spectral variations, best seen in the\n4630-4686 A emission feature. Using the late-WN spectral types of Crowther &\nSmith (1997), GR290 apparently varied between the WN11 and WN8-9 spectral\ntypes, the hotter being the star the fainter its visual magnitude. This\nspectrum-visual luminosity anticorrelation of GR290 is reminiscent of the\nbehaviour of the best studied LBVs. During the 2008 minimum we find a\nsignificant decrease in bolometric luminosity, which could be attributed to\nabsorption by newly formed circumstellar matter. We suggest that, presently,\nthe broad 4686 A line and the optical continuum are formed in a central WR\nregion, while the narrow emission line spectrum originate in an extended,\nslowly expanding envelope, that is composed by matter ejected during previous\nhigh luminosity phases, and ionized by the central nucleus.
