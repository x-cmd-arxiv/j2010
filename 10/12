To accommodate high operating rates while retaining low\ncomputational cost, efficient analog-to digital (ADC) converters must be\ndeveloped. Many of limitations encountered in current converters are due to a\ntraditional assumption that the sampling state needs to acquire the data at the\nNyquist rate, corresponding to twice the signal bandwidth. In this thesis a\nmethod of sampling far below the Nyquist rate for sparse spectrum multiband\nsignals is investigated. The method is called periodic non-uniform sampling,\nand it is useful in a variety of applications such as data converters, sensor\narray imaging and image compression. Firstly, a model for the sampling system\nin the frequency domain is prepared. It relates the Fourier transform of\nobserved compressed samples with the unknown spectrum of the signal. Next, the\nreconstruction process based on the topic of compressed sensing is provided. We\nshow that the sampling parameters play an important role on the average sample\nratio and the quality of the reconstructed signal. The concept of condition\nnumber and its effect on the reconstructed signal in the presence of noise is\nintroduced, and a feasible approach for choosing a sample pattern with a low\ncondition number is given. We distinguish between the cases of known spectrum\nand unknown spectrum signals respectively. One of the model parameters is\ndetermined by the signal band locations that in case of unknown spectrum\nsignals should be estimated from sampled data. Therefore, we applied both\nsubspace methods and non-linear least square methods for estimation of this\nparameter. We also used the information theoretic criteria (Akaike and MDL) and\nthe exponential fitting test techniques for model order selection in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 17:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-12"}

The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is sensitive to dark\nenergy and presents an independent signature of dark energy in the absence of\nmodified gravity and curvature. The ISW effect occurs on large scales, where\ncosmic variance is high and where there are large amounts of missing data in\nthe CMB and large scale structure maps due to Galactic confusion. Moreover,\nexisting methods in the literature often make strong assumptions about the\nstatistics of the underlying fields or estimators. Together these effects can\nseverely limit signal extraction. We review literature on the ISW effect,\ncomparing statistical subtleties between existing methods, and identifying\nseveral limitations. We propose a novel method to detect and measure the ISW\nsignal. This method assumes only that the primordial CMB field is Gaussian. It\nis based on a sparse inpainting method to reconstruct missing data and uses a\nbootstrap technique to avoid assumptions about the statistics of the estimator.\nIt is a complete method, using three complementary statistical methods. We\napply our method to Euclid-like simulations and show we can expect a \\sim\n7\\sigma model-independent detection of the ISW signal with WMAP7-like data,\neven with missing data. Other tests return \\sim 4.7\\sigma detection levels for\na Euclid-like survey, with levels independent from whether the galaxy field is\nnormally or lognormally distributed. We apply our method to the 2 Micron All\nSky Survey (2MASS) and WMAP7 CMB data and find detections in the 1.1 -\n2.0\\sigma range, as expected from simulations.

Testing and calibrating against observations is essential for\ntheir reliability. For this purpose one preferably uses observed stars that\nhave never experienced strong binary interaction, i.e. \"true single stars\".\nHowever, the binary fraction among massive stars is high and identifying \"true\nsingle stars\" is not straight forward. Binary interaction affects systems in\nsuch a way that the initially less massive star becomes, or appears to be,\nsingle. For example, mass transfer results in a widening of the orbit and a\ndecrease of the luminosity of the donor star, which makes it very hard to\ndetect. After a merger or disruption of the system by the supernova explosion,\nno companion will be present.\n  The only unambiguous identification of \"true single stars\" is possible in\ndetached binaries, which contain two main-sequence stars. For these systems we\ncan exclude the occurrence of mass transfer since their birth. A further\nadvantage is that binaries can often provide us with direct measurements of the\nfundamental stellar parameters. Therefore, we argue these binaries are worth\nthe effort needed to observe and analyze them. They may provide the most\nstringent test cases for single stellar models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-13"}

We estimate that, although relatively bright, the primordial\nstellar populations are very diffuse, producing a population with surface\nbrightnesses below surveys` detection limits and are easily stripped by tidal\nforces. Although we cannot yet present unmistakable evidence for the existence\nof the fossils of first galaxies in the Local Group, the results of our studies\nsuggest observational strategies that may demonstrate their existence.\nPrimarily, the detection of \"ghost halos\" of primordial stars around isolated\ndwarfs would prove that stars formed in minihalos (M<10^8 M_solar) before\nreionization, and strongly suggest that at least a fraction of the ultra-faint\ndwarfs are fossils of the first galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 20:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 21:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In fact, exact thresholds on the\nsparsity (the size of the support set), under which with high probability a\nsparse signal can be recovered from i.i.d.

It was also known\nthat there is a tradeoff between the sparsity and the $\\ell_1$ minimization\nrecovery stability. In this paper, we give a \\emph{closed-form}\ncharacterization for this tradeoff which we call the scaling law for\ncompressive sensing recovery stability.

A\nmajority of the results obtained, thus far, in this field and reviewed in this\narticle are theoretical. Nevertheless, relevant experimental settings are\nsurveyed too, with emphasis on perspectives for implementation of the\ntheoretical predictions in the experiment. Physical systems discussed in the\nreview belong to the realms of nonlinear optics (including artificial optical\nmedia, such as photonic crystals, and plasmonics) and Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC). The solitons are considered in one, two, and three\ndimensions (1D, 2D, and 3D). Basic properties of the solitons presented in the\nreview are their existence, stability, and mobility. Although the field is\nstill far from completion, general conclusions can be drawn. In particular, a\nnovel fundamental property of 1D solitons, which does not occur in the absence\nof NLs, is a finite threshold value of the soliton norm, necessary for their\nexistence. In multidimensional settings, the stability of solitons supported by\nthe spatial modulation of the nonlinearity is a truly challenging problem, for\nthe theoretical and experimental studies alike.

We perform first\ncosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation that simultaneously\ninclude magnetic fields, radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction.\nIn isolated and idealized cluster models, the magnetothermal instability (MTI)\ntends to reorient the magnetic fields radially. Using cosmological simulations\nof the Santa Barbara cluster we detect radial bias in the velocity and magnetic\nfields. Such radial bias is consistent with either the inhomogeneous radial gas\nflows due to substructures or residual MTI-driven field rearangements that are\nexpected even in the presence of turbulence. Although disentangling the two\nscenarios is challenging, we do not detect excess bias in the runs that include\nanisotropic thermal conduction. The anisotropy effect is potentially detectable\nvia radio polarization measurements with LOFAR and SKA and future X-ray\nspectroscopic studies with the IXO.

Such a signature was found by Schweizer and Seitzer (1992;\nAJ, 104, 1039) at roughly 4sigma confidence. In this paper, we revisit this\nissue with a nearly ten-fold larger sample of 0.01<z<0.03 galaxies selected\nfrom the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\nparameterize tidal structure using a repeatable algorithmic measure of\nasymmetry, and correlate this with color offset from the early-type galaxy\ncolor-magnitude relation. We recover the color offset-asymmetry correlation;\nfurthermore, we demonstrate observationally for the first time that this effect\nis driven by a highly-significant trend towards younger ages at higher\nasymmetry values. We present a simple model for the evolution of early-type\ngalaxies through gas-rich major and minor mergers that reproduces their\nobserved build-up from z=1 to the present day and the distribution of\npresent-day colors and ages. We show using this model that if both stellar\npopulations and asymmetry were ideal `clocks' measuring the time since last\nmajor or minor gas-rich interaction, then we would expect a rather tight\ncorrelation between age and asymmetry. We suggest that the source of extra\nscatter is natural diversity in progenitor star formation history, gas content,\nand merger mass ratio, but quantitative confirmation of this conjecture will\nrequire sophisticated modeling. We conclude that the asymmetry-age correlation\nis in basic accord with the merger hypothesis, and indicates that an important\nfraction of the early-type galaxy population is affected by major or minor\nmergers at cosmologically-recent times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 01:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We assume that the mass\nloss from a cluster is provided by mass loss from evolved stars and by the\ndynamical evaporation of low-mass members due to two-body relaxation. The data\nfor the latter process were scaled to the models from high-resolution N-body\ncalculations. We also investigate how a change of the $m_l$-limit influences\nmagnitudes and colours of clusters of a given mass and derive a necessary\ncondition for a luminosity and colour flash. The discreteness of the IMF leads\nto bursts in magnitude and colour of model clusters at moments when red\nsupergiants or giants appear and then die. The amplitude of the burst depends\non the cluster mass and on the spectral range; it is strongly increased in the\nNIR compared to optical passbands. In the discrete case, variations of the\nparameter $m_l$ are able to substantially change the magnitude-age and\n$M/L$-age relations. For the colours, the lowering of $m_l$ considerably\namplifies the discreteness effect. The influence of dynamical mass loss on\ncolour and magnitude is weak, although it provides a change of the slopes of\nthe considered relations, improving their agreement with observations. For the\nGalactic open clusters we determined luminosity and tidal mass independent of\neach other. The derived mass-to-luminosity ratio shows, on average, an increase\nwith cluster age in the optical, but gradually declines with age in the NIR.\nThe observed flash statistics can be used to constrain $m_l$ in open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 07:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

We\nbegin by deriving a tight lower bound on the variance of the entropy production\nfor a given mean of this random variable. It is shown that the Evans-Searles\nfluctuation theorem alone imposes a significant lower bound on the variance\nonly when the mean entropy production is very small. It is then nonetheless\ndemonstrated that upon incorporating additional information concerning the\nentropy production, this lower bound can be significantly improved, so as to\ncapture extensivity properties. Another important aspect of the fluctuation\nproperties of the entropy production is the relationship between the mean and\nthe variance, on the one hand, and the probability of the event where the\nentropy production is negative, on the other hand. Accordingly, we derive upper\nand lower bounds on this probability in terms of the mean and the variance.\nThese bounds are tighter than previous bounds that can be found in the\nliterature. Moreover, they are tight in the sense that there exist probability\ndistributions, satisfying the Evans-Searles fluctuation theorem, that achieve\nthem with equality.

In particular, Elashoff's objection appears to be\nimportant because it was the very first critique pointing directly to the\ncentral problem of the FSN: \"R & R claim that the number of studies hidden in\nthe drawers would have to be 65,000 to achieve a mean effect size of zero when\ncombined with the 345 studies reviewed here. But surely, if we allowed the\nhidden studies to be negative, on the average no more than 345 hidden studies\nwould be necessary to obtain a zero mean effect size\" (p. 392). Thus, users of\nmeta-analysis could have been aware right from the beginning that something was\nwrong with the statistical reasoning of the FSN. In particular, from an applied\nresearch perspective, it is therefore of interest whether any of the\nfundamental objections on the FSN are reflected in standard handbooks on\nmeta-analysis as well as -and of course even more importantly- in meta-analytic\nstudies itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 09:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-13"}

In this paper we investigate a similar model with a hyper-cubic\nsymmetry coupled to an unbroken U(1) in which the domain walls can form\njunctions and hence a lattice. We call this model the charge-coupled\ncubic-anisotropy (CCCA) model. First, we present a detailed parametric study of\nthe U(1) x Z2 model; features which we vary include the nature of the initial\nconditions and the coupling constants. This allows us to identify interesting\nparameters to vary in the more complicated, and hence more computationally\nintensive, CCCA models. In particular we find that the coefficient of the\ninteraction term can be used to engineer three separate regimes: phase mixing,\ncondensation and phase separation with the condensation regime corresponding to\na single value of the coupling constant defined by the determinant of the\nquartic interaction terms being zero. We then identify the condensation regime\nin the CCCA model and show that, in this regime, the number of domain walls\ndoes not scale in the standard way if the initial conditions have a\nsufficiently high background charge. Instead of forming loops of domain wall,\nwe find that, within the constraints of dynamic range, the network appears to\nbe moving toward a glass-like configuration. We find that the results are\nindependent of the dimension of the hyper-cube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 09:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-24"}

Besides, an\nambiguity in high-energy behavior of pion and especially kaon production cross\nsections for nucleon-nucleus collisions may affect essentially the calculated\nneutrino flux. There is the energy region where above flux uncertainties\nsuperimpose.

However unlike the type I\nor type II Higgs doublet models, the charged Higgs couplings in these models\ncontain additional flavor dependent CP violating phases. These phases can\naccount for the recent hints of the beyond standard model CP violation in the\n$B_d$ and $B_s$ mixing. In particular, there is a range of parameters in which\nnew phases do not contribute to the $K$ meson CP violation but give identical\nnew physics phases in the $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 10:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Two models are\nanalyzed: an exponential and an inverse power law dependence for the density as\na function of distance from the equatorial plane. The presence of a medium with\nvariable density along the polar direction progressively converts the original\nspherical shell into a bipolar nebula. In the case of the nebula around\n$\\eta$-Carinae, we know the time elapsed since the great outburst in 1840. An\nexact match between observed radii and velocities can be obtained by fine\ntuning the parameters involved, such as initial radius, initial velocity and\nthe typical scale that characterizes the gradient in density. The observed\nradius and velocity of the Homunculus as a function of the polar angle in\nspherical coordinates can be compared with the corresponding simulated data by\nintroducing the efficiency in a single or multiple directions. Once the 3D\nspatial structure of the Homunculus is obtained, we can compose the image by\nintegrating along the line of sight. In order to simulate the observed image,\nwe have considered a bipolar nebula with constant thickness and an optically\nthin emitting layer. Some simulated cuts of the relative intensity are reported\nand may represent a useful reference for the astronomical cuts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 11:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-20"}

The decays can be classified according to the\ntype of the anomaly (triangle or box) that governs the corresponding amplitude\nwhen it is extrapolated to the chiral point. In order to take the momentum\ndependencies of the form factors into account, the actual calculations are\nperformed in the frame work of vector meson dominance (VMD) models, namely in\nterms of the original hidden gauge model and modern generalized models. The\nresults of the triangle-anomaly sector show that the hidden gauge model and the\nmodern modifications can describe the data equally well.

It has been claimed that these detections show that the cosmic ray\nintensity in the starburst galaxies is three orders of magnitude higher than in\nthe Milky Way galaxy, assuming that the observed gamma rays arise due to pion\nproduction of cosmic rays interacting with the ambient gas. The observed\nspectrum is flatter than the cosmic ray spectrum in the Milky Way galaxy, and\nthis could be due to the much higher gas density in the starburst galaxies [3].\nThe interpretation seems to be in line with the Ginzburg-model of the origin of\ncosmic rays according to which the cosmic rays are accelerated in the shells of\nsupernova remnants. As an immediate corollary it follows that the cosmic ray\ndriven gamma ray luminosity should scale with the gas density and supernova\nrate. At lower energies, gamma-ray measurements with the Fermi LAT instrument\ncould provide support for this scaling [4]. However, there are nagging doubts\nabout the interpretation of the observations at very high energies.

Previous differential equation modeling and analysis of MMOs has mainly\nfocused on local mechanisms to explain the small oscillations. Numerical\ncontinuation studies reported different MMO patterns based on parameter\nvariation. This paper aims at improving the link between local analysis and\nnumerical simulation. Our starting point is a numerical study of a singular\nreturn map for the Koper model which is a prototypical example for MMOs that\nalso relates to local normal form theory. We demonstrate that many MMO patterns\ncan be understood geometrically by approximating the singular maps with affine\nand quadratic maps. Motivated by our numerical analysis we use abstract affine\nand quadratic return map models in combination with two local normal forms that\ngenerate small oscillations. Using this decomposition approach we can reproduce\nmany classical MMO patterns and effectively decouple bifurcation parameters for\nlocal and global parts of the flow.

Their behaviors often\ndiffer from what is expected on general physical grounds and field-theory\nconsiderations. We identify the configurations of physical interest by\nexamining the stability of the string (brane) solutions dual to the flux tubes\nbetween the bound states. In particular, we formulate and prove several general\nstatements concerning the perturbative stability of such string (brane)\nsolutions, relevant for these configurations in a general class of backgrounds.\nWe apply the results to N = 4 SYM and N = 1 at finite temperature and at\ngeneric points of the Coulomb branch. In all cases, the problematic regions are\nfound to be unstable and hence physically irrelevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 15:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-13"}

Its quantisation is therefore straightforward in LQG like\nrepresentations which by design lead to non anomalous, unitary, albeit\ndiscontinuous representations of the spatial diffeomorphism group. In\nparticular, the complete set of (distributional) solutions to the quantum\nconstraints, a preferred and complete algebra of Dirac observables and the\nassociated physical inner product has been constructed. On the other hand, the\ntwo copies of Witt algebras are classically isomorphic to the Dirac or\nhypersurface deformation algebra of General Relativity (although without\nstructure functions). The question we address in this paper, also raised by\nLaddha and Varadarajan in their paper, is whether we can quantise the Dirac\nalgebra in such a way that its space of distributional solutions coincides with\nthe one just described. This potentially teaches us something about LQG where a\nclassically equivalent formulation of the Dirac algebra in terms of spatial\ndiffeomorphism Lie algebras is not at our disposal. We find that, in order to\nachieve this, the Hamiltonian constraint has to be quantised by methods that\nextend those previously considered. The amount of quantisation ambiguities is\nsomewhat reduced but not eliminated. We also show that the algebra of\nHamiltonian constraints closes in a precise sense, with soft anomalies, that\nis, anomalies that do not cause inconsistencies. We elaborate on the relevance\nof these findings for full LQG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 15:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-13"}
