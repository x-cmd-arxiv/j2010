Given a set $V$ of $n$\nelements, we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels. A\npairwise preference label is obtained as a response, typically from a human, to\nthe question \"which if preferred, u or v?$ for two elements $u,v\\in V$. We\nassume possible non-transitivity paradoxes which may arise naturally due to\nhuman mistakes or irrationality. The goal is to linearly order the elements\nfrom the most preferred to the least preferred, while disagreeing with as few\npairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two\nparameters: The loss and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference\nlabels we obtain). This is a typical learning problem, with the exception that\nthe space from which the pairwise preferences is drawn is finite, consisting of\n${n\\choose 2}$ possibilities only. We present an active learning algorithm for\nthis problem, with query bounds significantly beating general (non active)\nbounds for the same error guarantee, while almost achieving the information\ntheoretical lower bound. Our main construct is a decomposition of the input\ns.t. (i) each block incurs high loss at optimum, and (ii) the optimal solution\nrespecting the decomposition is not much worse than the true opt. The\ndecomposition is done by adapting a recent result by Kenyon and Schudy for a\nrelated combinatorial optimization problem to the query efficient setting. We\nthus settle an open problem posed by learning-to-rank theoreticians and\npractitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To\nfurther show the power and practicality of our solution, we show how to use it\nin concert with an SVM relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 21:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 11 May 2011 12:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 17 May 2011 11:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 18:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 08:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2011 07:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 20:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2011 20:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 20:14:43 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 5 May 2011 19:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 7 May 2011 18:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-18"}

The field\neigenmodes are expanded on the basis of Bloch modes of the corresponding\nperiodic structure, and the resulting eigenvalue problem is diagonalized on a\ntruncated basis including a finite number of Bloch bands. The Bloch-mode\nexpansion is very effective for modeling modes of very extended disordered\nstructures in a given frequency range, as only spectrally close bands must be\nincluded in the basis set. The convergence can be easily verified by repeating\nthe diagonalization for an increased band set. As illustrations, we apply the\nmethod to the W1 line-defect waveguide and to the L3 coupled-cavity waveguide,\nboth based on a photonic crystal slab with a triangular lattice of circular\nholes. We compute and characterize the eigenfrequencies, spatial field profiles\nand radiation loss rates of the localized modes induced by disorder. For the W1\nwaveguide, we demonstrate that radiation losses, at the bottom of the\nspatially-even guided band, are determined by a small hybridization with Bloch\nmodes of the spatially-odd band, induced by disorder in spite of their\nfrequency separation. The Bloch-mode expansion method has a very broad range of\napplications: it can be also used to accurately compute the modes of structures\nwith systematic modulations of the periodic dielectric constant, as in several\ndesigns of high-Q cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 21:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 14:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-21"}

Despite extensive studies, however, the optical light curve\nhas never been discussed and its redshift is unconstrained. Possible\ncorrelations between optical and X-ray data are analysed. Methods: Photometric\ndata from TNG in the R and I bands were used to compare the optical afterglow\nwith the X-ray light curve. The HyperZ package and a late time VLT host\nobservation were used to derive redshift estimates. Results: The I-band\nafterglow decay followed a power-law of index {\\alpha} = 2.1 $\\pm$ 0.6, after a\nlate break at ~ $1.3 \\times 10^5$ s. The R - I color is remarkably red and the\nbroadband spectral index {\\beta}_OX = $0.9 \\pm 0.1$ is consistent with the\nX-ray spectral slope {\\beta}_X. Although a photometric redshift of z > 4 is the\nmost conservative result to consider, a photometric redshift of z = 5.2 $\\pm$\n0.3 is suggested with no extinction in the host, based on which an isotropic\nenergy E_{\\gamma},iso = $(3.8 \\pm 0.7) \\times 10^52$ erg and a jet opening\nangle {\\theta} ~ $3.7^{\\circ}$ are subsequently derived.\n  Conclusions: The combined X-ray and optical data suggest an achromatic break,\nwhich we interpret as a jet break. The post jet break slope obeys roughly the\nclosure relation for the jet slow cooling model. Because of the afterglow's\nvery red color, in order for the redshift to be low (z < 1), extinction, if\npresent in the host, must be significantly high. Since the optical-to-X-ray\nindex is consistent with the X-ray spectrum, and there is no XRT evidence for\nexcess N_H, GRB 050502B was likely at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 23:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We prepare the initial state in form of a\ncollapsing wave-packet of a small occupation number but of very high energy,\nand observe that the classical configuration indeed develops. Our results\nconfirm the previous estimates, showing that because of self-sourcing the\nwave-packet forms a classicalon configuration with radius that increases with\ncenter of mass energy. Thanks to self-sourcing by energy, unlike solitons, the\nproduction of classicalons dominates the high-energy scattering. In order to\nconfront classicalizing and non-classicalizing theories, we use a language in\nwhich the scattering cross section can be universally understood as a geometric\ncross section set by a classical radius down to which waves can propagate\nfreely. The difference is, that in non-classicalizing examples this radius\nshrinks with increasing energy, whereas in classicalizing theories expands and\nbecomes macroscopic. We study analogous scattering in a Galileon system and\ndiscover that classicalization is less efficient there. We thus observe, that\nclassicalization is source-sensitive and that Goldstones pass the first test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 23:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}

There are two\nmajor proposed models for the driving of molecular outflows: (1) molecular gas\nis accelerated by a magnetic pressure gradient or magnetocentrifugal wind\nmechanism before the magnetic field and molecular gas are decoupled, (2) the\nlinear momentum of a highly collimated jet is transferred to the ambient\nmolecular gas. In order to distinguish between these two models, it is crucial\nto observe the configuration of the magnetic field. An observation of a\ntoroidal magnetic field is strong evidence that the first of the models is\nappropriate. In this paper, we calculated the polarization distribution of\nthermal dust radiation due to the alignment of dust grains along the magnetic\nfield using molecular outflow data calculated by two-dimensional axisymmetric\nMHD simulations. An asymmetric distribution around the z-axis is characteristic\nfor magnetic fields composed of both poloidal and toroidal components. We\ndetermined that the outflow has a low polarization degree compared with the\nenvelope and that the envelope and outflow have different polarization\ndirections (B-vector), namely, the magnetic field within the envelope is\nparallel to the global magnetic field lines while the magnetic field of the\noutflow is perpendicular to it. Thus we have demonstrated that the\npoint-symmetric (rather than axisymmetric) distributions of low polarization\nregions indicate that molecular outflows are likely to be magnetically driven.\nObservations of this polarization distribution with tools such as ALMA would\nconfirm the origin of the molecular outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2010 04:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2011 12:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Current criteria to assess different models of a\nnetwork mainly rely on how close a model matches the network in terms of\ntopological characteristics. Typical topological metrics are clustering\ncoefficient, distance distribution, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency\nmatrix, and the gap between the first and the second largest eigenvalues, which\nare widely used to evaluate and compare different models of a network. In this\npaper, we show that evaluating complex network models based on the current\ntopological metrics can be quite misleading.

We further show that it is not useful to assess network\nmodels by examining some topological characteristics such as clustering\ncoefficient and distance distribution, if robustness of the Internet against\nrandom node removals is the only concern.

All of them are already\npublished or submitted for publication. I present here the short summary of\nmain results: The ultraviolet singular structure of the bulk-to-bulk\npropagators for higher spin gauge fields in AdS4 space is analyzed in details.\nOne loop mass renormalization is studied on a simple example. The conformal\ninvariant Lagrangian with the k-th power of Laplacian for the hierarchy of\nconformally coupled scalars with increasing scaling dimensions connected with\nthe k-th Euler density is rederived using the Fefferman-Graham ambient space\napproach. The corresponding gauged ambient metric, Fefferman- Graham expansion\nand extended Penrose-Brown-Henneaux transformations are proposed and analyzed.\nLinearized gauge invariant interactions of scalar and general higher even spin\nfields in the AdSD space are obtained. A generalized Weyl transformation is\nproposed and the corresponding Weyl invariant action for cubic coupling of a\nscalar to a spin \\ell field is constructed. Using Noether's procedure several\ncubic interactions between different HS gauge fields are derived, including\ncubic selfinteraction of even spin gauge fields in a flat background. Then the\nmain result - the complete off-shell gauge invariant Lagrangian for the\ntrilinear interactions of Higher Spin Fields with arbitrary spins s1, s2, s3 in\na flat background is presented.

The process of mixing of this instability in the ISM near the\nGalactic plane is investigated. The initial ISM is assumed to consist of two\nfluids: plasma gas and cosmic-ray particles, in hydrostatic equilibrium,\ncoupled with a uniform, azimuthally-aligned magnetic field. The evolution of\nthe instability is explored in two models: an isothermal exponential-declining\ndensity model and a two-layered, hyperbolic tangent temperature model. After a\nsmall perturbation, the unstable gas aggregates at the bottom of the magnetic\nloops and forms dense blobs. The growth rate of the instability decreases as\nthe coupling between the cosmic rays and the plasma becomes stronger (meaning a\nsmaller CR diffusion coefficient). The mixing is enhanced by the cosmic-ray\ndiffusion, while the shape of the condensed gas depends sensitively on the\ninitial equilibrium conditions. The hyperbolic tangent temperature model\nproduces a more concentrated and round shape of clumps at the foot points of\nrising magnetic arches, like the observed giant molecular cloud, whereas the\nexponential density model gives rise to a filamentary morphology of the clumpy\nstructure. When considering a minimum perpendicular or cross field diffusion of\ncosmic rays, which is often substantially smaller than the parallel coefficient\n$\\kappa_{\\|}$, around $2%-4%$ of $\\kappa_{\\|}$, the flow speed is significantly\nincreased such that the magnetic loops extend to a greater altitude. We\nspeculate that the galactic wind flow perpendicular to the galactic disk may be\nfacilitated by Parker instabilities through the cross field diffusion of cosmic\nrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2010 15:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2011 04:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-07"}
