Some of the\npredictions have already appeared on previous paper (O, Mg, Si, S and Ca) but\nsome other predictions are new (Ba, Cr and Ti).\n  We compute several chemical evolution models by adopting different initial\nmass functions for the Galactic bulge and then compare the results to new data\nincluding both giants and dwarf stars in the bulge. In this way we can impose\nstrong constraints on the star formation history of the bulge.\n  We find that in order to reproduce at best the metallicity distribution\nfunction one should assume a flat IMF for the bulge not steeper than the\nSalpeter one. The initial mass function derived for the solar vicinity provides\ninstead a very poor fit to the data. The [el/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations in the\nbulge are well reproduced by a very intense star formation rate and a flat IMF\nas in the case of the stellar metallicity distribution.

Finally, our model can also reproduce the decrease of the\n[O/Mg] ratio for [Mg/H] > 0 in the bulge, which is confirmed by the new data\nand interpreted as due to mass loss in massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 16:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

For example, hadrons can be produced at large transverse\nmomentum directly within a hard higher-twist QCD subprocess, rather than from\njet fragmentation. Such \"direct\" processes can explain the deviations from\nperturbative QCD predictions in measurements of inclusive hadron cross sections\nat fixed x_T= 2p_T/\\sqrt s, as well as the \"baryon anomaly\", the anomalously\nlarge proton-to-pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy ion collisions.\nInitial-state and final-state interactions of the struck quark lead to\nBjorken-scaling single-spin asymmetries, diffractive deep inelastic scattering,\nthe breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions, as well as\nnuclear shadowing and antishadowing. The Gribov-Glauber theory predicts that\nantishadowing of nuclear structure functions is not universal, but instead\ndepends on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark, thus\nexplaining the anomalous nuclear dependence measured in deep-inelastic neutrino\nscattering. One cannot attribute such phenomena to the structure of the hadron\nor nucleus itself. It is thus important to distinguish \"static\" structure\nfunctions computed from the square of the target light-front wavefunctions,\nversus \"dynamical\" structure functions which include the effects of the\nfinal-state rescattering of the struck quark. The importance of the J=0\nphoton-quark QCD contact interaction in deeply virtual Compton scattering is\nemphasized. The scheme-independent BLM method for setting the renormalization\nscale is discussed. Eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity greatly\nimproves the precision of QCD predictions and increases the sensitivity of\nsearches for new physics at the LHC. Other novel features of QCD are discussed,\nincluding the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 18:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Satellites of these galaxies are accreted anisotropically, entering\nthe virial radius of their hosts from specific \"spots\" with respect to the\nlarge scale structure. Furthermore, material which is tidally stripped from\nthese satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and is\ncharacterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. The angular\npattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projected\nstripped DM is investigated within a coordinate system determined by the\nlocation of the LG companion and the simulated Virgo cluster across concentric\nshells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. Remarkably, the principal axis of the\nellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well within\nthe halo to a few r_vir. A spherical harmonics transform applied to the angular\ndistributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributions\nof both the satellites entry points and stripped DM is dominated by the l=2\nquadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shells\nconsidered. It follows that the structure of the outer (r>0.5 r_vir) regions of\nthe main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it is\nembedded. Given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of the\nMilky Way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be applied\nto the stellar halo of the MW and M31.

This notion could have implications on our understanding of the\nevolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) and possibly on their contribution\nto cosmic energy. This paper discusses the evolution of a non-singular black\nhole (NSBH) based on a recent model [1]. We begin with a study of the\nthermodynamic process of the black hole in this model, and demonstrate the\nexistence of a maximum horizon temperature T_{max}, corresponding to a unique\nmass value. At this mass value the specific heat capacity C changes signs to\npositive and the body begins to lose its black hole characteristics. With no\nloss of generality, the model is used to discuss the time evolution of a\nprimordial black hole (PBH), through the early radiation era of the universe to\npresent, under the assumption that PBHs are non-singular. In particular, we\ntrack the evolution of two benchmark PBHs, namely the one radiating up to the\nend of the cosmic radiation domination era, and the one stopping to radiate\ncurrently, and in each case determine some useful features including the\ninitial mass m_{f} and the corresponding time of formation t_{f}. It is found\nthat along the evolutionary history of the universe the distribution of PBH\nremnant masses (PBH-RM) PBH-RMs follows a power law.

SU(4) Kondo physics has been\nexperimentally observed, and studied in detail, in Carbon Nanotube Quantum\nDots. Adopting a two molecular orbital basis, the Hamiltonian is recast into a\nform where one of the molecular orbitals decouples from the charge reservoir,\nalthough still interacting capacitively with the other molecular orbital. This\nbasis transformation explains in a clear way how the charge transport in this\nsystem turns from double- to single-channel when it transitions from the SU(4)\nto the 2LSU2 regime. The charge occupancy of these molecular orbitals displays\ngate-potential-dependent occupancy oscillations that arise from a competition\nbetween the Kondo and Intermediate Valence states. The determination of whether\nthe Kondo or the Intermediate Valence state is more favorable, for a specific\nvalue of gate potential, is assessed by the definition of an energy scale\n$T_0$, which is calculated through DMRG.

While analytically\nconvenient, the PPP only accurately models networks whose nodes are placed\nindependently and use ALOHA as the channel access protocol, which preserves the\nindependence. Correlations between transmitter locations in non-Poisson\nnetworks, which model intelligent access protocols, makes the outage analysis\nextremely difficult.

It is a\nvolume-, magnitude-, and size-limited (d < 40 Mpc, |b| > 30 degrees, m_(Bcorr)\n< 15.5, D25>1') survey of 2,331 galaxies using IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 microns.\nEach galaxy is observed for 240 s and mapped to > 1.5 x D25. The final\nmosaicked images have a typical 1 sigma rms noise level of 0.0072 and 0.0093\nMJy / sr at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively. Our azimuthally-averaged surface\nbrightness profile typically traces isophotes at mu_3.6 (AB) (1 sigma) ~ 27 mag\narcsec^-2, equivalent to a stellar mass surface density of ~ 1 Msun pc^-2. S^4G\nthus provides an unprecedented data set for the study of the distribution of\nmass and stellar structures in the local Universe. This paper introduces the\nsurvey, the data analysis pipeline and measurements for a first set of\ngalaxies, observed in both the cryogenic and warm mission phase of Spitzer. For\nevery galaxy we tabulate the galaxy diameter, position angle, axial ratio,\ninclination at mu_3.6 (AB) = 25.5 and 26.5 mag arcsec^-2 (equivalent to ~ mu_B\n(AB) =27.2 and 28.2 mag arcsec^-2, respectively). These measurements will form\nthe initial S^4G catalog of galaxy properties. We also measure the total\nmagnitude and the azimuthally-averaged radial profiles of ellipticity, position\nangle, surface brightness and color. Finally, we deconstruct each galaxy using\nGALFIT into its main constituent stellar components: the bulge/spheroid, disk,\nbar, and nuclear point source, where necessary. Together these data products\nwill provide a comprehensive and definitive catalog of stellar structures, mass\nand properties of galaxies in the nearby Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 05:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 16:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However,\nunderstanding these issues is limited by a fundamental issue of spatial\nscaling: most evidence of past trends comes from rain gauge data, whereas\ntrends into the future are produced by climate models, which rely on gridded\naggregates. To study this further, we fit the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)\ndistribution to the right tail of the distribution of both rain gauge and\ngridded events. The results of this modeling exercise confirm that return\nvalues computed from rain gauge data are typically higher than those computed\nfrom gridded data; however, the size of the difference is somewhat surprising,\nwith the rain gauge data exhibiting return values sometimes two or three times\nthat of the gridded data.

We then\ninvestigate the effect of loyalty on the outcome of an auction. In doing so, we\nare confronted with several statistical challenges in that standard statistical\nmodels lead to a misrepresentation of the data and a violation of the model\nassumptions. The reason is that loyalty networks result in an extreme\nclustering of the data, with few high-volume sellers accounting for most of the\nindividual transactions.

While these studies have investigated sources of differing\ncomplexity, the one thing they all have in common is they assume continuous\ndata streams. In reality, the LISA data stream will contain gaps from such\npossible events such as repointing of the satellite antennae, to discharging\nstatic charge build up on the satellites, to disruptions due to micro-meteor\nstrikes. In this work we conduct a large scale Monte Carlo parameter estimation\nsimulation for galactic binaries assuming data streams containing gaps. As the\nexpected duration and frequency of the gaps are currently unknown, we have\ndecided to focus on gaps of approximately one hour, occurring either once per\nday or once per week. We also study the case where, as well as the expected\nperiodic gaps, we have a data drop-out of one continuous week. Our results show\nthat for for galactic binaries, a gap of once per week introduces a bias of\nbetween 0.5% and 1% in the estimation of parameters, for the most important\nparameters such as the sky position, amplitude and frequency. This number rises\nto between 3% and 7% for the case of one gap a day, and to between 4% and 9%\nwhen we have one gap a day and a spurious gap of a week.

The images of fermion\nannihilation-creation operators must satisfy the canonical anti-commutation\nrelations, when they operate on a spinor subspace.

In the current work, we investigated the\nuse of total variation superiorization (TVS) schemes that can be applied as an\nalgorithmic add-on to perturbation-resilient iterative projection algorithms\nfor pCT image reconstruction. Methods: The block-iterative diagonally relaxed\northogonal projections (DROP) algorithm was used for reconstructing Geant4\nMonte Carlo simulated pCT data sets. Two TVS schemes added on to DROP were\ninvestigated; the first carried out the superiorization steps once per cycle\nand the second once per block.

Results: With both TVS schemes, superior\nspatial and density resolution was achieved compared to the standard DROP\nalgorithm. Eliminating the feasibility proximity check improved the image\nquality, in particular image noise, in the once-per-block superiorization,\nwhile also halving image reconstruction time.

We demonstrate that the reported analyses for both non-resonant\nand resonant magnetic diffraction at low energies near the absorption K-edge\nare not appropriate. In its place, we apply a radically different formulation,\nthoroughly tried and tested, that incorporates all magnetic contributions to\nresonant x-ray diffraction allowed by the established chemical and magnetic\nstructures. Essential to a correct formulation of diffraction by a magnetic\ncrystal with resonant ions at sites that are not centres of inversion symmetry\nare parity-odd atomic multipoles, time-even (polar) and time-odd\n(magneto-electric), that arise from enhancement by the electric-dipole (E1) -\nelectric-quadrupole (E2) event. Analyses of azimuthal-angle scans on two\nspace-group forbidden reflections, hexagonal (0, 0, 3)h and (0, 0, 9)h,\ncollected by Kokubun et al. above and below the Morin temperature (TM = 250K),\nallow us to obtain good estimates of contributing polar and magneto-electric\nmultipoles, including the iron anapole.

In this paper we study a quite different geometrical object:\nthe spin clusters, defined as connected domains where the spin takes a constant\nvalue. Unlike the usual loops, the domain walls separating different spin\nclusters can cross and branch. Moreover, they come in two versions, \"thin\" or\n\"thick\", depending on whether they separate spin clusters of different or\nidentical colours. For these reasons their critical behaviour is different\nfrom, and richer than, those of FK clusters. We develop a transfer matrix\ntechnique enabling the formulation and numerical study of spin clusters even\nwhen Q is not an integer. We further identify geometrically the crossing events\nwhich give rise to conformal correlation functions. We study the critical\nbehaviour both in the bulk, and at a boundary with free, fixed, or mixed\nboundary conditions. This leads to infinite series of fundamental critical\nexponents, h_{l_1-l_2,2 l_1} in the bulk and h_{1+2(l_1-l_2),1+4 l_1} at the\nboundary, valid for 0 <= Q <= 4, that describe the insertion of l_1 thin and\nl_2 thick domain walls.

Here we find\nthat the connectivity among a very small portion of the richest nodes can\ndominate the assortativity and clustering coefficients of a large network,\nwhich reveals that the rich-club connectivity is leveraged throughout the\nnetwork. Our study suggests that more attention should be payed to the\norganization pattern of rich nodes, for the structure of a complex system as a\nwhole is determined by the associations between the most influential\nindividuals. Moreover, by manipulating the connectivity pattern in a very small\nrich-club, it is sufficient to produce a network with desired assortativity or\ntransitivity. Conversely, our findings offer a simple explanation for the\nobserved assortativity and transitivity in many real world networks --- such\nbiases can be explained by the connectivities among the richest nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 14:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for\nstudying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft over a long period of time.\nThese properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 15:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-11"}
