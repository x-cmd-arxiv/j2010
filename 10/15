The study presents a systematic large-scale analysis\nof such conformational changes in the side chains. The results indicate that\nshort and long side chains have different propensities for the conformational\nchanges. Long side chains with three or more dihedral angles are often subject\nto large conformational transition. Shorter residues with one or two dihedral\nangles typically undergo local conformational changes not leading to a\nconformational transition. The relationship between the local readjustments and\nthe equilibrium fluctuations of a side chain around its unbound conformation is\nsuggested. Most of the side chains undergo larger changes in the dihedral angle\nmost distant from the backbone. The amino acids with symmetric aromatic (Phe\nand Tyr) and charged (Asp and Glu) groups show the opposite trend where the\nnear-backbone dihedral angles change the most. The frequencies of the\ncore-to-surface interface transitions of six nonpolar residues and Tyr exceed\nthe frequencies of the opposite, surface-to-core transitions. The binding\nincreases both polar and nonpolar interface areas. However, the increase of the\nnonpolar area is larger for all considered classes of protein complexes.

High quality, deep HST/ACS data, allowed us to obtain\nthe deepest color-magnitude diagram to date, reaching the old main sequence\nturnoff (F814 ~ 29) with good photometric accuracy. Our analysis, based on\nthree different SFH codes, shows that Tucana is an old and metal-poor stellar\nsystem, which experienced a strong initial burst of star formation at a very\nearly epoch (~ 13 Gyr ago) which lasted a maximum of 1 Gyr (sigma value). We\nare not able to unambiguously answer the question of whether most star\nformation in Tucana occurred before or after the end of the reionization era,\nand we analyze alternative scenarios that may explain the transformation of\nTucana from a gas-rich galaxy into a dSph. Current measurements of its radial\nvelocity do not preclude that Tucana may have crossed the inner regions of the\nLocal Group once, and so gas stripping by ram pressure and tides due to a close\ninteraction cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the high star formation\nrate measured at early times may have injected enough energy into the\ninterstellar medium to blow out a significant fraction of the initial gas\ncontent. Gas that is heated but not blown out would also be more easily\nstripped via ram pressure. We compare the SFH inferred for Tucana with that of\nCetus, the other isolated LG dSph galaxy in the LCID sample. We show that the\nformation time of the bulk of star formation in Cetus is clearly delayed with\nrespect to that of Tucana. This reinforces the conclusion of Monelli et al.\n(2010) that Cetus formed the vast majority of its stars after the end of the\nreionization era implying, therefore, that small dwarf galaxies are not\nnecessarily strongly affected by reionization, in agreement with many\nstate-of-the-art cosmological models.

Our goal is to\nminimize the time by which all of the packets for both users are delivered to\ntheir respective destinations.

We prove that the optimal total\ntransmit power has the same structure as the optimal single-user transmit\npower. We also prove that there exists a cut-off power level for the stronger\nuser. If the optimal total transmit power is lower than this cut-off level, all\ntransmit power is allocated to the stronger user, and when the optimal total\ntransmit power is larger than this cut-off level, all transmit power above this\nlevel is allocated to the weaker user.

One direct operational manifestation of these\nuncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information\nlocking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a\nuniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical\nkey of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this\nquantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about\nthe message, in which case the message is said to be \"locked\". Furthermore,\nknowing the key, it is possible to recover, that is \"unlock\", the message. In\nthis paper, we make the following contributions by exploiting a connection\nbetween uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. We\nintroduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to\nlow-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also\nimplies an entropic uncertainty relation. We prove that random bases satisfy\nuncertainty relations with a stronger definition and better parameters than\npreviously known. Our proof is also considerably simpler than earlier proofs.\nWe apply this result to show the existence of locking schemes with key size\nindependent of the message length. We give efficient constructions of metric\nuncertainty relations. The bases defining these metric uncertainty relations\nare computable by quantum circuits of almost linear size. This leads to the\nfirst explicit construction of a strong information locking scheme. Moreover,\nwe present a locking scheme that is close to being implementable with current\ntechnology. We apply our metric uncertainty relations to exhibit communication\nprotocols that perform quantum equality testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 19:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 19:55:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 03:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2013 11:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-09"}

The CO\nemission is in agreement with a disk in keplerian rotation around a 2.0 Msun\nstar, confirming that MWC758 is indeed an intermediate mass star. By comparing\nthe observation with theoretical disk models, we derive that the disk surface\ndensity Sigma(r) steeply increases from 40 to 100 AU, and decreases\nexponentially outward. Within 40 AU, the disk has to be optically thin in the\ncontinuum emission at millimeter wavelengths to explain the observed dust\nmorphology, though our observations lack the angular resolution and sensitivity\nrequired to constrain the surface density on these spatial scales.

The algorithm is trained with a visual\nclassification and then compared to several independent visual classifications\nincluding the Galaxy Zoo first release catalog. We find a very good correlation\nbetween the automated classification and classical visual ones.

In this paper we study the influence of the ionizing cluster mass on\nthe emission line spectrum of Hii regions in order to determine the influence\nof low mass clusters on the integrated emission line spectra of galaxies.\nMethods. For this purpose, we present a grid of photoionization models that\ncovers metallicities from Z = 0.001 to Z = 0.040, ages from 0.1 to 10 Ma (with\na time step of 0.1 Ma), and cluster initial masses from 1 to 107 Mo. The\nstellar masses follow a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) in an\ninstantaneous burst mode of star formation. We obtain power-law scale-relations\nbetween emission-line luminosities and ionizing cluster masses from the grids\nand we evaluate the dependences on the ionizing cluster mass for some line\nluminosities, equivalent widths and line ratios. Results. Power-law\nscale-relations are shown to be useful tools to obtain robust diagnostics, as\nexamples: (a) H?/H? ratio varies from the usually assumed value of 2.86, these\nvariations imply the existence of a lower limit to the attainable precision in\nextinction estimations of ?E(B - V) ~ 0.1.; (b) EW(H?) is a good age indicator\nwith a small dependence on cluster mass, while EW([O iii] 5007) shows a\nnoteworthy mass dependence; (c) abundance estimations from R23 are practically\nunaffected by variations of the cluster mass; (d) estimations from S 23 and ?'\nwould improve if the cluster mass dependences were considered and (e) [Oii]\n3727/H? is a good star formation rate indicator for ages older than -4.5 Ma.

We show\nthat the growth of density fluctuations is scale-dependent even in the linear\nregime in some modified gravity theories, which opens a new possibility of\ntesting the theories observationally. We propose to use the genus of the\niso-density contours, an intrinsic measure of the topology of large scale\nstructure, as a statistic to be used in such tests. In Einstein's general\ntheory of relativity, density fluctuations are growing at the same rate on all\nscales in the linear regime, and the genus per comoving volume is almost\nconserved as structures are growing homologously, so we expect that the\ngenus-smoothing scale relation is basically time-independent. However, in some\nmodified gravity models where structures grow with different rates on different\nscales, the genus-smoothing scale relation should change over time. This can be\nused to test the gravity models with large scale structure observations. We\nstudied the case of the f(R) theory, DGP braneworld theory as well as the\nparameterized post-Friedmann (PPF) models.

In classical\napproach the problem of complex equilibrium is solved by minimization of the\nsystem Gibbs' free energy subject to logistic constraints. DTD demands any\nisolated system to comprise smaller subentities, which individual equilibria\nare based on the balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces, acting\nagainst them. The internal forces are equal to the subsystems thermodynamic\naffinities, while external forces originate from subsystems mutual\ninteractions. Those interactions impose additional constraints on the mother\nsystem Gibbs' free energy minimum. Basic expression of discrete thermodynamics,\nbeing multiplied by subsystems deviations from their \"true\" thermodynamic\nequilibria, is naturally identical to d'Alembert's principle. A thermodynamic\nversion of d'Alembert's principle in combination with derived from it\nthermodynamic version of the principle of virtual work, allowed us to express\nthe interactive constraints as a condition, that the sum of all subsystems\nthermodynamic affinities, multiplied by their deviations from their \"true\"\nequilibria, must be equal to zero. The revised formula of global equilibrium\ncondition in complex chemical systems contains three terms - system Gibbs' free\nenergy, logistic constraints, identical to their classical version, and\ninteractive constraints, originated from the subsystems mutual interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 22:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-13"}

For 30 Oe < H < 100 Oe, the PMFC response crosses over to a\ndiamagnetic response as the temperature is lowered below 8 K. For 100 Oe < H <\n300 Oe, the diamagnetic response undergoes an unexpected reversal in its field\ndependence above a characteristic temperature (designated as T*(VL) = 7.9 K),\nwhere the field-cooled cool-down magnetization curves intersect. The in-phase\nand out-of-phase ac susceptibility data confirm the change in the\nsuperconducting state across T*(VL).

The nonlinear\ndynamics of the whistlers and the wakefields is shown to be governed by a\ncoupled set of nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) and driven Boussinesq-like\nequations. It is found that the quantum force associated with the Bohm\npotential introduces two characteristic length scales, which lead to the\nexcitation of multiple wakefields in a strongly magnetized dense plasma (with a\ntypical magnetic field strength $B_{0}\\gtrsim10^{9}$ T and particle density\n$n_{0}\\gtrsim10^{36}$ m$^{-3}$), where the SPF strongly dominates over the CPF.\nIn other regimes, namely $B_{0}\\lesssim10^{8}$ T and $\\ n_{0}\\lesssim10^{35}$\nm$^{-3}$, where the SPF is comparable to the CPF, a plasma wakefield can also\nbe excited self-consistently with one characteristic length scale. Numerical\nresults reveal that the wakefield amplitude is enhanced by the quantum\ntunneling effect, however it is lowered by the external magnetic field.

We also work with\nextinction (Av) maps of the LMC. A total of 272 molecular clouds have been\ndetected in the LMC in a previous molecular survey, accounting for 230 giant\nmolecular clouds and 42 smaller clouds. We perform correlations between the IR\nemission/extinction, and atomic and molecular gas tracers. We compare the\natomic gas that surrounds the molecular cloud with the molecular gas in the\ncloud. Using a dust emission model, we derive the physical properties of dust\nin and outside the clouds: equilibrium temperature, emissivity and extinction.\nWe also determine the luminosity of the interstellar radiation field\nintercepted by the cloud, and the total IR luminosity. Statistically, we do not\nfind any significant difference in the dust properties between the atomic and\nthe molecular phases. In particular we do not find evidence for a systematic\ndecrease of the dust temperature in the molecular phase, with respect to the\nsurrounding, presumably atomic gas. This is probably because giant molecular\nclouds are the sites of star formation, which heat the dust, while the smallest\nclouds are unresolved. The ratio between the IR luminosity and the cloud mass\n(LDust/Mgas) does not seem to correlate with Mgas. The highest value of the\nratio we derived is 18.1 Lsol/Msol in the 30 Doradus region, which is known to\nbe the most prominent star formation region of the LMC, while the most likely\nvalue is 0.5 and is representative of quiescent clouds.

Asteroseismology is an effcient tool not only for testing stellar\nstructure and evolutionary theory but also constraining the parameters of stars\nfor which solar-like oscillations are detected, presently. As an important\nsouthern asteroseismic target, Tau Ceti, is a metal-poor star. The main\nfeatures of the oscillations and some frequencies of ? Ceti have been\nidentified. Many scientists propose to comprehensively observe this star as\npart of the Stellar Observations Network Group. Aims. Our goal is to obtain the\noptimal model and reliable fundamental parameters for the metal-poor star Tau\nCeti by combining all non-asteroseismic observations with these seismological\ndata. Methods. Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC), a grid of stellar\nmodel candidates that fall within all the error boxes in the HR diagram have\nbeen constructed, and both the model frequencies and large- and small-\nfrequency separations are calculated using the Guenther's stellar pulsation\ncode. The \\chi2c minimization is performed to identify the optimal modelling\nparameters that reproduce the observations within their errors. The frequency\ncorrections of near-surface effects to the calculated frequencies using the\nempirical law, as proposed by Kjeldsen and coworkers, are applied to the\nmodels. Results. We derive optimal models, corresponding to masses of about\n0.775 - 0.785 M? and ages of about 8 - 10 Gyr. Furthermore, we find that the\nquantities derived from the non-asteroseismic observations (effective\ntemperature and luminosity) acquired spectroscopically are more accurate than\nthose inferred from interferometry for ? Ceti, because our optimal models are\nin the error boxes B and C, which are derived from spectroscopy results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 13:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

Namely, one could either store an\nentangled state and retrieve it directly from the memory, or rather store two\nseparate single-mode squeezed states and then combine them with a beam-splitter\nto generate the final entangled state. In this paper, we address the question\nof which of these two options yields the higher entanglement. By adopting a\nwell established descrip- tion of QND feedback memories, and a simple but\nrealistic noise model, we analytically determine the optimal choice for several\nregions of noise parameters and quantify the advantage it entails, not only in\nterms of final entanglement but also in terms of the capability of the final\nstate to act as a shared resource for quantum teleportation. We will see that,\nfor 'ideal' or 'nearly ideal' memories, the more efficient of the two options\nis the one that better protects the quadrature subject to the largest noise in\nthe memory (by increasing it and making it more robust).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 13:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Such models predict an\nequation of state with w=P/rho=-2/3 and can be represented in cosmological\nperturbation theory by an elastic medium with rigidity and a relativistic sound\nspeed. An important question is whether such a network can be created from\nrandom initial conditions. We consider various models which allow the formation\nof domain walls, and present results from an extensive set of numerical\ninvestigations. The idea is to give a mechanism which prevents the natural\npropensity of domain walls to collapse and lose energy, almost to the point\nwhere a domain wall network freezes in. We show that when domain walls couple\nto a field with a conserved charge, there is a parameter range for which charge\ncondenses onto the domain walls, providing a resistive force to the otherwise\nnatural collapse of the walls\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 15:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-18"}

The light curve of SN 1999dn is mostly\nsimilar in shape to that of other SNeIb but with a moderately faint peak\nM_V=-17.2 mag). From the bolometric light curve and ejecta expansion\nvelocities, we estimate that about 0.11 Msun of 56Ni were produced during the\nexplosion and that the total ejecta mass was 4-6 Msun with a kinetic energy of\nat least 5x10^{51} erg.
