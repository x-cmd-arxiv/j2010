The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a\nconvex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First,\nwe build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of\nsub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of\npossible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by\nefficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard\nsparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are\nidentified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the\ncoding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the\ntemporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of\nsamples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual\nsamples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration\nis critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in\nparticular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the\nsub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of\nC-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the\nsub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each\nindividual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument\nidentification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use\nsparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic\nsounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number\nof sources on a recording.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2010 16:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An\ninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates\nadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe\ncomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked\ncluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.\nRelativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting\nwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. The\nevolution of Cygnus A is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowing\nfrom the hotspots. Mass flowing into hotspots from the jets is assumed to be\nsmall, greatly reducing the mass of gas flowing back along the jet, common in\nprevious calculations, that would disrupt the spatial segregation of\nsynchrotron-loss ages observed inside FR II radio lobes. We compute the\nevolution of the cocoon when the velocity and cosmic ray luminosity of the\nhotspots are constant and when they vary with time. If cosmic rays mix with\ncluster gas in hotspots before flowing into the radio lobe, the thermal gas is\nheated to mildly relativistic temperatures, producing an unobserved pressure\ninside the lobe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2010 18:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Methods: The H.E.S.S.\narray of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) has a high\nsensitivity compared with previous instruments (~1% of the Crab flux in 25\nhours observation time for a 5 sigma point-source detection) and has a large\nfield of view (~5 deg in diameter). HESS J1507-622 was discovered within the\nongoing H.E.S.S. survey of the inner Galaxy, and the source was also studied by\nmeans of dedicated multiwavelength observations. Results: A Galactic gamma-ray\nsource, HESS J1507-622, located ~3.5 deg from the Galactic plane was detected\nwith a statistical significance > 9 sigma.

We performed rheometry and video\nmicroscopy measurements on a variety of suspensions to determine the mechanism\nfor this behavior. Shear profiles and normal stress measurements indicate that,\nin the shear thickening regime, stresses are transmitted through frictional\nrather than viscous interactions, and come to the surprising conclusion that\nthe local constitutive relation between stress and shear rate is not\nnecessarily shear thickening. If the suspended particles are heavy enough to\nsettle we find the onset stress of shear thickening tau_min corresponds to a\nhydrostatic pressure from the weight of the particle packing where neighboring\nparticles begin to shear relative to each other. Above tau_min, dilation is\nseen to cause particles to penetrate the liquid-air interface of the sheared\nsample. The upper stress boundary tau_max of the shear thickening regime is\nshown to roughly match the ratio of surface tension divided by a radius of\ncurvature on the order of the particle size. These results suggest a new model\nin which the increased dissipation in the shear thickening regime comes from\nfrictional stresses that emerge as dilation is frustrated by a confining stress\nfrom surface tension at the liquid-air interface. When instead the suspensions\nare confined by solid walls and have no liquid-air interface, we find tau_max\nis set by the stiffness of the most compliant boundary which frustrates\ndilation. This rheology can be described by a non-local constitutive relation\nin which the local relation between stress and shear rate is shear thinning,\nbut where the stress increase comes from a normal stress term which depends on\nthe global dilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 00:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 07:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Both the simulations and\nhelioseismic measurements are extremely challenging, but it becomes clear that\nthe key to understanding the enigma of sunspots is a synergy between models and\nobservations. Recent observations and radiative MHD numerical models have\nprovided a convincing explanation to the Evershed flows in sunspot penumbrae.\nAlso, they lead to the understanding of sunspots as self-organized magnetic\nstructures in the turbulent plasma of the upper convection zone, which are\nmaintained by a large-scale dynamics. Local helioseismic diagnostics of\nsunspots still have many uncertainties, some of which are discussed in this\nreview. However, there have been significant achievements in resolving these\nuncertainties, verifying the basic results by new high-resolution observations,\ntesting the helioseismic techniques by numerical simulations, and comparing\nresults obtained by different methods. For instance, a recent analysis of\nhelioseismology data from the Hinode space mission has successfully resolved\nseveral uncertainties and concerns (such as the inclined-field and phase-speed\nfiltering effects) that might affect the inferences of the subsurface\nwave-speed structure of sunspots and the flow pattern.

MCs, over a free-fall\ntime are exposed to numerous dynamical phenomena, of which, the interaction\nwith a thin, dense shell of gas is but one. Below we present results from\nself-gravitating, 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({\\small SPH})\nsimulations of the problem; seven realisations of the problem have been\nperformed by varying the precollision density within the cloud, the nature of\nthe post-collision shock, and the spatial resolution in the computational\ndomain. Irrespective of the type of shock, a complex network of dense\nfilaments, seeded by numerical noise, readily appears in the shocked cloud.\nSegregation of the dense and rarefied gas phases also manifests itself in a\nbimodal distribution of gas density. We demonstrate that the power-spectrum for\nrarefied gas is Kolomogorov like, while that for the denser gas is considerably\nsteeper. As a corollary to the main problem, we also look into the possibly\ndegenerative effect of the {\\small SPH} artificial viscosity on the impact of\nthe incident shell. It is observed that stronger viscosity leads to greater\npost-shock dissipation, that strongly decelerates the incident shock-front and\npromotes formation of contiguous structure, albeit on a much longer timescale.\nWe conclude that too much viscosity is likely to enhance the proclivity towards\ngravitational boundedness of structure, leading to unphysical fragmentation.On\nthe other hand, insufficient resolution appears to suppress fragmentation.\nConvergence of results is tested at both extremes, first by repeating the test\ncase with more than a million particles and then with only half the number of\nparticles in the original test case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 06:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The result is a single-variable light-front Schrodinger equation\nwhich determines the eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons\nfor general spin and orbital angular momentum. The coordinate z in AdS space is\nuniquely identified with a Lorentz-invariant coordinate zeta which measures the\nseparation of the constituents within a hadron at equal light-front time and\ndetermines the off-shell dynamics of the bound state wavefunctions as a\nfunction of the invariant mass of the constituents. The hadron eigenstates\ngenerally have components with different orbital angular momentum; e.g., the\nproton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless quarks has L=0 and L=1 light-front\nFock components with equal probability. Higher Fock states with extra\nquark-anti quark pairs also arise. The soft-wall model also predicts the form\nof the non-perturbative effective coupling and its beta-function. The AdS/QCD\nmodel can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal\nsolutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian or by applying\nthe Lippmann-Schwinger method to systematically include QCD interaction terms.\nSome novel features of QCD are discussed, including the consequences of\nconfinement for quark and gluon condensates.

No jet is seen for the case of Schwartzschild black hole\ncase, while the total energy of the jet is as large as 10^50 erg for a rapidly\nrotating Kerr black hole case (a=0.95). In order to explain the high luminosity\nof a GRB, it is concluded that a rapidly rotating black hole is favored\n('faster is better'). We also find in the case of a=0.95 that (i) the\nstagnation region is clearly found in the jet region, (ii) the ordered poloidal\nfield lines are seen in the jet, (iii) the jet region is surrounded by a\n'Wall-like' structure that has a higher pressure than the jet region and\ncontains strong vertical magnetic fields, and (iv) the jet is initiated by\noutgoing Poynting flux from the outer horizon of the black hole\n(Blandford-Znajek effect). The bulk Lorentz factor of the jet is still of the\norder of unity. However, energy density of electro-magnetic fields dominates\nthe one of rest-mass in the jet. It can be expected that a relativistic jet\nwill be seen if we perform a simulation for a longer time scale (of the order\nof 10-100 sec).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2010 14:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2010 11:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 09:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
