Only 10 such systems are\nknown to exist, 6 of which have yielded NS masses in the range 1.06 - 1.86\nM$_{\\odot}$.We present the first orbital solutions of two further eclipsing\nsystems, OAO 1657-415 and EXO 1722-363, whose donor stars have only recently\nbeen identified. Using observations obtained using the VLT/ISAAC NIR\nspectrograph, our initial work was concerned with providing an accurate\nspectral classification of the two counterpart stars, leading to a consistent\nexplanation of the mechanism for spin period evolution of OAO 1657-415.\nCalculating radial velocities allowed orbital solutions for both systems to be\ncomputed. These are the first accurate determinations of the NS and counterpart\nmasses in XRB pulsar systems to be made employing NIR spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 16:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}

The fundamental reason for this was attributed to a \"threshold\nsaturation\" phenomena derived by Kudekar, Richardson and Urbanke. In\nparticular, it was shown that the belief propagation (BP) threshold of the\nspatially coupled codes is equal to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding\nthreshold of the underlying constituent codes. In this sense, the BP threshold\nis saturated to its maximum value. Moreover, it has been empirically observed\nthat the same phenomena also occurs when transmitting over more general classes\nof BMS channels. In this paper, we show that the effect of spatial coupling is\nnot restricted to the realm of channel coding. The effect of coupling also\nmanifests itself in compressed sensing. Specifically, we show that\nspatially-coupled measurement matrices have an improved sparsity to sampling\nthreshold for reconstruction algorithms based on verification decoding. For\nBP-based reconstruction algorithms, this phenomenon is also tested empirically\nvia simulation. At the block lengths accessible via simulation, the effect is\nquite small and it seems that spatial coupling is not providing the gains one\nmight expect. Based on the threshold analysis, however, we believe this\nwarrants further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 17:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}

When a solid body is\ndragged through a viscous fluid at constant velocity, the presence of a wall\nincreases fluid drag, and thus the net force required to maintain speed has to\nincrease. In contrast, recent optical trapping experiments have revealed that\nthe propulsive force generated by human spermatozoa is decreased by the\npresence of boundaries. Here, we use a series of simple models to analytically\nelucidate the propulsive effects of a solid boundary on passively actuated\nfilaments and model flagella. For passive flexible filaments actuated\nperiodically at one end, the presence of the wall is shown to increase the\npropulsive forces generated by the filaments in the case of displacement-driven\nactuation, while it decreases the force in the case of force-driven actuation.\nIn the case of active filaments as models for eukaryotic flagella, we\ndemonstrate that the manner in which a solid wall affects propulsion cannot be\nknown a priori, but is instead a nontrivial function of the flagellum\nfrequency, wavelength, its material characteristics, the manner in which the\nmolecular motors self-organize to produce oscillations (prescribed activity\nmodel or self-organized axonemal beating model), and the boundary conditions\napplied experimentally to the tethered flagellum.

Coinciding with\nthe launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope, both space- and ground-based data\nhave supported a picture whereby asteroid analogs persist at a significant\nfraction of cool white dwarfs, and are prone to tidal disruption when passing\nclose to the compact stellar remnant. The ensuing debris can produce a\ndetectable infrared excess, and the material gradually falls onto the star,\npolluting the atmosphere with heavy elements that can be used to determine the\nbulk composition of the destroyed planetary body. Based on the observations to\ndate, the parent bodies inferred at white dwarfs are best described as\nasteroids, and have a distinctly rocky composition similar to material found in\nthe inner Solar System. Their minimum masses are typical of large asteroids,\nand can approach or exceed the mass of Vesta and Ceres, the two largest\nasteroids in the Solar System. From the number of stars surveyed in various\nstudies, the fraction of white dwarfs that host terrestrial planetary system\nremnants is at least a few percent, but likely to be in the range 20% to 30%.\nTherefore, A- and F-type stars form terrestrial planets efficiently, with a\nfrequency at least as high as the remnants detected at their white dwarf\ndescendants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 13:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 08:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

However, the AGNs found in\ndeep X-ray surveys are often too weak to allow direct measurement of the column\ndensity of obscuring matter. One method adopted in recent years to identify\nheavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs under such circumstances is to use the\nobserved mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio as a proxy for the column\ndensity. This is based on the supposition that the amount of energy lost by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum to the obscuring matter and reprocessed into\ninfrared emission is directly related to the column density and that the proxy\nis not sensitive to other physical parameters of the system (aside from\ncontamination by dust emission from, for example, star-forming regions). Using\nMonte Carlo simulations, we find that the energy losses experienced by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum in the obscuring matter are far more sensitive to\nthe shape of the X-ray continuum and to the covering factor of the X-ray\nreprocessor than they are to the column density of the material. Specifically\nwe find that it is possible for the infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio for a\nCompton-thin source to be just as large as that for a Compton-thick source even\nwithout any contamination from dust. Since the intrinsic X-ray continuum and\ncovering factor of the reprocessor are poorly constrained from deep X-ray\nsurvey data, we conclude that the mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio is not\na reliable proxy for the column density of obscuring matter in AGNs even when\nthere is no other contribution to the mid-infrared luminosity aside from X-ray\nreprocessing. This conclusion is independent of the geometry of the obscuring\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 20:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We define a set of elliptical annular regions around the\ncentral ionizing cluster with an uniformity in their observed properties and\nconsider each annulus as an independent thin shell structure. For the first\ntime our models fit the relative surface brightness profiles in both the\noptical (Halpha, [OII], [OIII]) and the mid-infrared emissions (8 mi and 24\nmi), under the assumption of a uniform metallicity (12+log(O/H) = 8.45; Esteban\net al. 2009) and an age for the stellar cluster of 4.5 Myr (Malumuth et al.\n1996). Our models also reproduce the observed uniformity of the R23 parameter\nand the increase of the [OII]/[OIII] ratio due to the decrease of the\nionization parameter. The variation of the Halpha profile is explained in terms\nof the differences of the occupied volume (the product of filling factor and\ntotal volume of the shell) in a matter-bounded geometry, which also allows to\nreproduce the observed pattern of the extinction. The 8 mi/24 mi ratio is low\n(ranging between 0.04 and 0.4) because it is dominated by the surviving of\nsmall dust grains in the HII region, while the PAHs emit more weakly because\nthey cannot be formed in these thin HII gas shells.

Chartrand\net al. obtained that $G$ is a tree if and only if $src(G)=m$, we will show that\n$src(G)\\neq m-1$, so $G$ is not a tree if and only if $src(G)\\leq m-2$, where\n$m$ is the number of edge of $G$. Furthermore, we characterize the graphs $G$\nwith $src(G)=m-2$. We next give a sharp upper bound for $src(G)$ according to\nthe number of edge-disjoint triangles in graph $G$, and give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the equality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 07:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

This is due to the fact that\nthe kernels of such operators are not locally integrable on the diagonal, so\nthe integral formally defining the operator or its bilinear form is not well\ndefined (the integrand is not in L^1) even for nice functions. However, since\nthe kernel only has singularities on the diagonal, the bilinear form is well\ndefined say for bounded compactly supported functions with separated supports.\n  One of the standard ways to interpret the boundedness of a singular integral\noperators is to consider regularized kernels, where the cut-off function is\nzero in a neighborhood of the origin, so the corresponding regularized\noperators with kernel are well defined (at least on a dense set). Then one can\nask about uniform boundedness of the regularized operators. For the standard\nregularizations one usually considers truncated operators.\n  The main result of the paper is that for a wide class of singular integral\noperators (including the classical Calderon-Zygmund operators in\nnon-homogeneous two weight settings), the L^p boundedness of the bilinear form\non the compactly supported functions with separated supports (the so-called\nrestricted L^p boundedness) implies the uniform L^p-boundedness of regularized\noperators for any reasonable choice of a smooth cut-off of the kernel. If the\nkernel satisfies some additional assumptions (which are satisfied for classical\nsingular integral operators like Hilbert Transform, Cauchy Transform,\nAhlfors--Beurling Transform, Generalized Riesz Transforms), then the restricted\nL^p boundedness also implies the uniform L^p boundedness of the classical\ntruncated operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 11:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2011 22:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

It is furthermore shown that the use of this null\nmodel indicates an evolutionary pressure towards low assortativity and that\nthis pressure is stronger for larger networks. It is also shown that selecting\nfor BW networks with low assortativity causes the BW degree distribution to\nslightly deviate from its power-law shape in the same way as the metabolic\nnetworks.

The residuals are also correlated with the\ntheoretical positions of the satellite with regard to the primary. We therefore\nhave revealed the presence of Orcus' satellite in our astrometric measurements.\nThe photocenter motion is much larger than the motion of Orcus around the\nbarycenter, and we show here that detecting some binaries through a carefully\ndevised astrometric technique might be feasible with telescopes of moderate\nsize. We also analyzed the system's mid-term photometry to determine whether\nthe rotation could be tidally locked to the satellite's orbital period. We\nfound that a photometric variability of 9.7+-0.3 days is clear in our data, and\nis nearly coincident with the orbital period of the satellite. We believe this\nvariability might be induced by the satellite's rotation. There is also a\nslight hint for an additional small variability in the 10 hr range that was\nalready reported in the literature. This short-term variability would indicate\nthat the primary is not tidally locked and therefore the system would not have\nreached a double synchronous state. Implications for the basic physical\nproperties of the primary and its satellite are discussed. From angular\nmomentum considerations we suspect that the Orcus satellite might have formed\nfrom a rotational fission. This requires that the mass of the satellite would\nbe around 0.09 times that of the primary, close to the value that one derives\nby using an albedo of 0.12 for the satellite and assuming equal densities for\nboth objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 12:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

We find that the number of terms included in the expansion must be\nlarge enough to resolve the large-scale distribution and shape of the halo but,\nbeyond this, additional terms result in little further improvement. Particle\nand subhalo orbits can be integrated in this realistic, time-varying halo\npotential approximation, at much lower cost than the original simulation, with\nhigh fidelity for many individual orbits, and a good match to the distributions\nof orbital energy and angular momentum. Statistically, the evolution of\nstructural subhalo properties, such as mass, half-mass radius and\ncharacteristic circular velocity, are very well reproduced in the halo\nexpansion approximation over several gigayears. We demonstrate an application\nof the technique by following the evolution of an orbiting subhalo at much\nhigher resolution than can be achieved in the original simulation.

A related question concerns the number of\nassembly modes of rigid mechanisms as a function of their nodes n, which is\nuniquely defined given m. Rigid 11-bar linkages, where n=7, are the simplest\nplanar linkages for which these questions were still open. It will be proven\nthat the maximal number of assembly modes of such linkages is exactly 56. The\nrigidity of a linkage is captured by a polynomial system derived from distance,\nor Cayley-Menger, matrices. The upper bound on the number of assembly modes is\nobtained as the mixed volume of a 5x5 system. An 11-bar linkage admitting 56\nconfigurations is constructed using stochastic optimisation methods. This\nyields a general lower bound of $\\Omega(2.3^n)$ on the number of assembly\nmodes, slightly improving the current record of $\\Omega(2.289^n)$, while the\nbest known upper bound is roughly $4^n$.

Among these features, the\nsurface irregularities and self-similarity structures at different spatial\nscales, especially in the range of 1 to 100 nm, are of high importance because\nthey greatly affect the surface interaction forces acting at a nanoscale\ndistance. An analytical method for parameterizing the surface irregularities\nand their correlations in nanosurfaces imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nis proposed. In this method, flicker noise spectroscopy - a statistical physics\napproach - is used to develop six nanometrological parameters characterizing\nthe high-frequency contributions of jump- and spike-like irregularities into\nthe surface texture. These contributions reflect the stochastic processes of\nanomalous diffusion and inertial effects, respectively, in the process of\nsurface manufacturing.

Using external observations of a\nMulti-Agent System to analyse, model, recognize agent behaviour could be very\nuseful to direct team actions.

Using an innovative wide-field\nX-ray optics design, WFXT provides a field of view of 1 square degree (10 times\nChandra) with an angular resolution of 5\" (Half Energy Width, HEW) nearly\nconstant over the entire field of view, and a large collecting area (up to 1\nm^2 at 1 keV, > 10x Chandra) over the 0.1-7 keV band. WFXTs low-Earth orbit\nalso minimizes the particle background. In five years of operation, WFXT will\ncarry out three extragalactic surveys at unprecedented depth and address\noutstanding questions in astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. In\nthis article, we illustrate the mission concept and the connection between\nscience requirements and mission parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 15:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

When such a monolayer is disturbed by the localized\nintroduction of a surfactant droplet, a radially divergent surfactant shock\nfront emanates from the surfactant origin and packs the particles into a\njammed, compact, annular band with a packing fraction that saturates at a peak\npacking fraction $\\phi^*$. As the resulting two-dimensional, disordered elastic\nband grows with time and is driven radially outwards by the surfactant, it\nfractures to form periodic triangular cracks with robust geometrical features.\nWe find the number of cracks $N$ and the compaction band radius $R^*$ at\nfracture onset vary monotonically with the initial packing fraction\n($\\phi_{init}$). However, its width $W^*$ is constant for all $\\phi_{init}$. A\nsimple geometric theory that treats the compaction band as an elastic annulus,\nand accounts for mass conservation allows us to deduce that $N \\simeq 2\\pi\nR^*/W^* \\simeq 4\\pi \\phi_{RCP}/\\phi_{init}$, a result we verify both\nexperimentally and numerically. We show the essential ingredients for this\nphenomenon are an initially low enough particulate packing fraction that allows\nsurfactant driven advection to cause passive jamming and eventual fracture of\nthe hydrophobic particulate interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 15:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2011 22:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
