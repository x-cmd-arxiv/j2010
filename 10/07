More recently,\nspatial interaction and dispersal have also been considered. While these leads\nto certain changes in community dynamics, their effect is sometimes fairly\nminimal, and demographic scenarios in which this difference is important have\nnot been systematically investigated.\n  We take a simple mean-field model which simulates birth, growth and death\nprocesses, and rewrite it with spatially distributed discrete individuals. Each\nindividual's growth and mortality is determined by a competition measure which\ncaptures the effects of neighbours in a way which retains the conceptual\nsimplicity of a generic, analytically-solvable model. Although the model is\ngeneric, we here parameterise it using data from Caledonian Scots Pine stands.\nThe dynamics of simulated populations, starting from a plantation lattice\nconfiguration, mirror those of well-established qualitative descriptions of\nnatural forest stand behaviour; an analogy which assists in understanding the\ntransition from artificial to old-growth structure.\n  When parameterised for Scots Pine populations, the signature of spatial\nprocesses is evident, but they do not have a large effect on first-order\nstatistics such as density and biomass. The sensitivity of this result to\nvariation in each individual rate parameter is investigated; distinct\ndifferences between spatial and mean-field models are seen only upon alteration\nof the interaction strength parameters, and in low density populations. Under\nthe Scots Pine parameterisation, dispersal also has an effect of spatial\nstructure, but not first-order properties. Only in more intense competitive\nscenarios does altering the relative scales of dispersal and interaction lead\nto a clear signal in first order behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 16:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-07"}

ABPM is a very effective technique for assessing biological,\nenvironmental, and drug effects on blood pressure. In order to enhance the\neffectiveness of ABPM for clinical and observational research studies via\nanalytical and graphical results, developing alternative data analysis\napproaches are important. The linear mixed model for the analysis of\nlongitudinal data is particularly well-suited for the estimation of, inference\nabout, and interpretation of both population and subject-specific trajectories\nfor ABPM data. Subject-specific trajectories are of great importance in ABPM\nstudies, especially in clinical research, but little emphasis has been placed\non this dimension of the problem in the statistical analyses of the data.

Turbulent fluxes of angular momentum and heat due to\nrotationally affected convection play a key role in determining differential\nrotation of stars. Here we perform a systematic comparison between Cartesian\nand spherical geometries as a function of the rotation rate. Aims. We extend\nthe earlier studies by using spherical wedges to obtain turbulent angular\nmomentum and heat transport as functions of the rotation rate from stratified\nconvection. We compare results from spherical and Cartesian models in the same\nparameter regime. In particular, we want to clarify whether the sharp\nequatorial profile of the horizontal Reynolds stress found in earlier Cartesian\nmodels is reproduced in spherical models. Methods. We employ direct numerical\nsimulations of turbulent convection. In order to reach as high spatial\nresolution as possible in the spherical runs, we model only parts of the\nlatitude and longitude. The rotational influence, measured by the Coriolis\nnumber, is varied from zero to roughly seven, which is the regime that is\nlikely to be realised in the solar convection zone. Cartesian simulations are\nperformed in overlapping parameter regimes. Results. For slow rotation we find\nthat the radial and latitudinal turbulent angular momentum fluxes are directed\ninward and equatorward, respectively. In the rapid rotation regime the radial\nflux changes sign in contradiction with theory. The latitudinal flux remains\nmostly equatorward and develops a maximum close to the equator. In Cartesian\nsimulations this peak can be explained by the strong `banana cells'. The\nlatitudinal heat flux is mostly equatorward for slow rotation but changes sign\nfor rapid rotation. The rotation profiles vary from anti-solar (slow equator)\nfor slow and intermediate rotation to solar-like (fast equator) for rapid\nrotation. The solar-like profiles are dominated by the Taylor--Proudman\nbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 19:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2011 19:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-07"}

We revisit this\nexample here, using it as an entree to three central concepts in quantum\nfoundations: contextuality, Bell-nonlocality, and complementarity.\nSpecifically, we show that Specker's parable offers a narrative thread that\nweaves together a large number of results, including: the impossibility of\nmeasurement-noncontextual and outcome-deterministic ontological models of\nquantum theory (the Kochen-Specker theorem), in particular the proof of\nKlyachko; the impossibility of Bell-local models of quantum theory (Bell's\ntheorem), especially the proofs by Mermin and Hardy; the impossibility of a\npreparation-noncontextual ontological model of quantum theory; and the\nexistence of triples of positive operator valued measures (POVMs) that can be\nmeasured jointly pairwise but not triplewise. Along the way, several novel\nresults are presented, including: a generalization of a theorem by Fine\nconnecting the existence of a joint distribution over outcomes of\ncounterfactual measurements to the existence of a noncontextual model; a\ngeneralization of Klyachko's proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem; a proof of\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem in the style of Hardy's proof of Bell's theorem; a\ncategorization of contextual and Bell-nonlocal correlations in terms of\nfrustrated networks; a new inequality testing preparation noncontextuality; and\nlastly, some results on the joint measurability of POVMs and the question of\nwhether these can be modeled noncontextually. Finally, we emphasize that\nSpecker's parable provides a novel type of foil to quantum theory, challenging\nus to explain why the particular sort of contextuality and complementarity\nembodied therein does not arise in a quantum world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 20:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2011 16:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2011 11:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 03:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

We present evidence for dimming of submm and radio flux during the peak\nof near-IR flares. This suggests that the variability of Sgr A* across its\nwavelength spectrum is phenomenologically related. The model explaining this\nnew behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically cooling\nplasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background\nquiescent emission from Sgr A*. When a flare is launched, the plasma blob is\nmost compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emission\nin radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. Absorption in the observed\nlight curve of Sgr A* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects of\nlower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescent\nbrightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. This implies that\nplasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow or\nfurther out in the flow. The depth of the absorption being larger in submm than\nin radio wavelengths implies that the intrinsic size of the quiescent emission\nincreases with increasing wavelength which is consistent with previous size\nmeasurements of Sgr A*. Lastly, we believe that occultation of the quiescent\nemission of Sgr A* at radio/submm by IR flares can be used as a powerful tool\nto identify flare activity at its earliest phase of its evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 00:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In this\nsetting of 'to observe or not to observe' state at the encoder, we compute\ncertain numerical examples and note a pleasing phenomenon, where encoder can\nobserve a relatively small fraction of states and yet communicate at maximum\nrate, i.e. rate when observing states at encoder is not cost constrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 01:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The 1.33 mm continuum emission is seen arisen from both\nsources, likely tracing the dusty putative disks around them. In particular,\nthe emission around the VLA 1 source is elongated in the equatorial plane with\na radius of ~ 300 AU. The envelope is well seen in C18O, extending to ~ 7000 AU\nout from the VLA 1 source, with the innermost part overlapping with the dusty\ndisk. It has a differential rotation, with the outer part (~ 2000-7000 AU)\nbetter described by a rotation that has constant specific angular momentum and\nthe inner part (~ 60-2000 AU) by a Keplerian rotation. The envelope seems to\nalso have some infall motion that is smaller than the rotation motion. Thus,\nthe material in the outer part of the envelope seems to be slowly spiraling\ninward with its angular momentum and the rotation can indeed become Keplerian\nin the inner part. A compact SO emission is seen around the VLA 1 source with a\nradius of ~ 400 AU and it may trace a shock such as an (inner) accretion shock\naround the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 01:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Using it we intend to measure redshifts while minimising\nthe dangers posed by the usual extraction techniques. GRB afterglows have\ngenerally very simple optical spectra over which the separate effects of\nabsorption and reddening in the GRB host, the intergalactic medium, and our own\nGalaxy are superimposed. We model all these effects over a series of template\nafterglow spectra to produce a set of clean spectra that reproduce what would\nreach our telescope. We also model carefully the effects of the\ntelescope-spectrograph combination and the properties of noise in the data,\nwhich are then applied on the template spectra. The final templates are\ncompared to the two-dimensional spectral data, and the basic parameters\n(redshift, spectral index, Hydrogen absorption column) are estimated using\nstatistical tools. We show how our method works by applying it to our data of\nthe NIR afterglow of GRB090423. At z ~ 8.2, this was the most distant object\never observed. We use the spectrum taken by our team with the Telescopio\nNazionale Galileo to derive the GRB redshift and its intrinsic neutral Hydrogen\ncolumn density. Our best fit yields z=8.4^+0.05/-0.03 and N(HI)<5x10^20 cm^-2,\nbut with a highly non-Gaussian uncertainty including the redshift range z [6.7,\n8.5] at the 2-sigma confidence level. Our method will be useful to maximise the\nrecovered information from low-quality spectra, particularly when the set of\npossible spectra is limited or easily parameterisable while at the same time\nensuring an adequate confidence analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 08:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Probably for the first time detailed\nmicroscopic investigations of the local properties of these compounds have been\nobtained by studying by means of EPR the surroundings of transition metal\nimpurities in these materials. These experiments enabled the identification of\nthe order parameter of the structural instability observed in these oxides.\nHowever, the idea to search for superconductivity came later motivated by\ntheoretical considerations that metallic hydrogen could become superconducting\nat high temperatures. Since SrTiO3 is an insulator it was thought that the\nimplantation of hydrogen would render it metallic and eventually also\nsuperconducting. This approach failed since the carrier density remained always\ntoo small. In sequence it was then tried to achieve a metallic state in oxide\nperovskites by varying their composition which was in so far promising as\nreduced SrTiO3 exhibits superconductivity at 0.3K [2]. Furthermore it was\nsubsequently shown [3] that Tc can be enhanced to 1.2K by doping SrTiO3 with\nNb. In spite of the fact that Tc was far below values achieved in A15\ncompounds, a remarkable observation was connected with the Nb doped perovskite,\nnamely for the first time long before predicted two-gap superconductivity was\nrealized here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 09:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-08"}

In the latter phase\nmassive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller\nsatellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z>3) outside of the\nvirial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are\nobtained from high resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a\nfull cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7e11\nM_sun h^-1 < M_vir < 2.7e13 M_sun h^-1 and central galaxy masses between 4.5e10\nM_sun h^-1 < M_* < 3.6e11 M_sun h^-1.

Using a new restframe S_3um/S_1.6um versus S_um/S_3um\ncriterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from the\nstellar population can be measured. For these radio galaxies, the median\nstellar mass is high, 2x10^11 M_sun, and remarkably constant within the range\n1<z<3.

We provide some theoretical justification for MASS and demonstrate\nits strengths on an extensive range of simulation studies and real world data\nsets by comparing it to many classical and modern classification methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 11:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-08"}

We present a\nmodel of long-run competitive markets to show that the multiplicity of\nbehaviors in an economic system, over a long time scale, emerge as statistical\nregularities (perfectly competitive markets obey Bose-Einstein statistics and\npurely monopolistic-competitive markets obey Boltzmann statistics) and that how\ninteraction among firms influences the evolutionary of competitive markets. It\nhas been widely accepted that perfect competition is most efficient. Our study\nshows that the perfectly competitive system, as an extreme case of competitive\nmarkets, is most efficient but not stable, and gives rise to economic crises as\nsociety reaches full employment. In the economic crisis revealed by our model,\nmany firms condense (collapse) into the lowest supply level (zero supply,\nnamely bankruptcy status), in analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation. This\ncurious phenomenon arises because perfect competition (homogeneous\ncompetitions) equals symmetric (indistinguishable) investment direction, a fact\nabhorred by nature. Therefore, we urge the promotion of monopolistic\ncompetition (heterogeneous competitions) rather than perfect competition. To\nprovide early warning of economic crises, we introduce a resolving index of\ninvestment, which approaches zero in the run-up to an economic crisis. On the\nother hand, our model discloses, as a profound conclusion, that the\ntechnological level for a long-run social or economic system is proportional to\nthe freedom (disorder) of this system; in other words, technology equals the\nentropy of system. As an application of this new concept, we give a possible\nanswer to the Needham question: \"Why was it that despite the immense\nachievements of traditional China it had been in Europe and not in China that\nthe scientific and industrial revolutions occurred?\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 12:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-08"}

The\nkey property of classicalization is the existence of a classicalizer field that\ncouples to energy-momentum sources.

Two\nkinds of natural classicalizers are Nambu-Goldstone bosons (or, equivalently,\nlongitudinal polarizations of massive gauge fields) and scalars coupled to\nenergy-momentum type sources.

The minimization\nproblem is then to find the point on the manifold closest to the data. We show\nthat the model manifolds of a large class of models, known as sloppy models,\nhave many universal features; they are characterized by a geometric series of\nwidths, extrinsic curvatures, and parameter-effects curvatures. A number of\ncommon difficulties in optimizing least squares problems are due to this common\nstructure. First, algorithms tend to run into the boundaries of the model\nmanifold, causing parameters to diverge or become unphysical. We introduce the\nmodel graph as an extension of the model manifold to remedy this problem. We\nargue that appropriate priors can remove the boundaries and improve convergence\nrates. We show that typical fits will have many evaporated parameters. Second,\nbare model parameters are usually ill-suited to describing model behavior; cost\ncontours in parameter space tend to form hierarchies of plateaus and canyons.\nGeometrically, we understand this inconvenient parametrization as an extremely\nskewed coordinate basis and show that it induces a large parameter-effects\ncurvature on the manifold. Using coordinates based on geodesic motion, these\nnarrow canyons are transformed in many cases into a single quadratic, isotropic\nbasin. We interpret the modified Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt fitting\nalgorithms as an Euler approximation to geodesic motion in these natural\ncoordinates on the model manifold and the model graph respectively. By adding a\ngeodesic acceleration adjustment to these algorithms, we alleviate the\ndifficulties from parameter-effects curvature, improving both efficiency and\nsuccess rates at finding good fits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 14:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

In\norder to test one of the inferred translocation mechanisms, namely the\nspontaneous piercing through the membrane induced only by thermal motion, we\ncalculate the energy cost associated with the insertion of a carbon nanotube\ninto a model phospholipid bilayer using the Single Chain Mean Field theory\nwhich is particularly suitable for the accurate measurements of equilibrium\nfree energies. We find that the energy cost of the bilayer rupture is quite\nhigh compared to the energy of thermal motion. This conclusion may indirectly\nsupport other energy dependent translocation mechanisms such as, for example,\nendocytosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2010 15:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-08"}

This restriction is lifted by the introduction of a\ncorresponding nonlocal potential without explicit energy dependence. Such a\nstrategy allows for a complete determination of the nucleon propagator below\nthe Fermi energy with access to the expectation value of one-body operators\n(like the charge density), the one-body density matrix with associated natural\norbits, and complete spectral functions for removal strength. The present\nformulation of the dispersive optical model (DOM) therefore allows the use of\nelastic electron-scattering data in determining its parameters. Application to\n${}^{40}$Ca demonstrates that a fit to the charge radius leads to too much\ncharge near the origin using the conventional assumptions of the functional\nform of the DOM. A corresponding incomplete description of high-momentum\ncomponents is identified, suggesting that the DOM formulation must be extended\nin the future to accommodate such correlations properly.

The variation\nlaw for Hubble's parameter generates two types of solutions for the average\nscale factor, one is of power-law type and other is of the exponential form.\nUsing these two forms, Einstein's modified field equations are solved\nseparately that correspond to expanding singular and non-singular models of the\nuniverse respectively. The energy-momentum tensor for such string as formulated\nby Letelier (1983) is used to construct massive string cosmological models for\nwhich we assume that the expansion ($\\theta$) in the model is proportional to\nthe component $\\sigma^{1}_{~1}$ of the shear tensor $\\sigma^{j}_{i}$.

For CMEs observed by both\nSTEREO spacecraft, it is possible to derive their direction using simultaneous\nobservations from the twin spacecraft and also, using observations from only\none spacecraft with fitting methods. This makes it possible to test and compare\ndifferent analyses techniques. In this article, we propose a new fitting method\nbased on observations from one spacecraft, which we compare to the commonly\nused fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999). We also compare the results from\nthese two fitting methods with those from two stereoscopic methods, focusing on\n12 CMEs observed simultaneously by the two STEREO spacecraft in 2008 and 2009.\nWe find evidence that the fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999) can result in\nsignificant errors in the determination of the CME direction when the CME\npropagates outside of 60deg \\pm 20 deg from the Sun-spacecraft line. We expect\nour new fitting method to be better adapted to the analysis of halo or limb\nCMEs with respect to the observing spacecraft. We also find some evidence that\ndirect triangulation in the HI fields-of-view should only be applied to CMEs\npropagating approximatively towards Earth (\\pm 20deg from the Sun-Earth line).\nLast, we address one of the possible sources of errors of fitting methods: the\nassumption of radial propagation. Using stereoscopic methods, we find that at\nleast seven of the 12 studied CMEs had an heliospheric deflection of less than\n20deg as they propagated in the HI fields-of-view, which, we believe, validates\nthis approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2010 22:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-28"}
