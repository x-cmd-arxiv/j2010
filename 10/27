It is not intended as a review on it, rather it is showed how\nthis question emerges naturally and can give useful insights to specific\ninstances. The first chapter is about the statistical mechanics of congestion\nin queuing networks. The second is devoted to the study of the glassy dynamics\nof facilitated spin models on disordered structures. In the third chapter, the\npresence of inverse phase transitions in tri-critical spin systems on\nheterogeneous random graphs is pointed out. Finally, the last chapter is on the\nrole of volatility in the evolution of social networks. In the conclusions, a\ngeneral insight about the interplay between structure and dynamics on\nheterogeneous random graphs is given. It is based on the different scaling of\nthe transition point with the moments of the degree distribution for continuous\nand discontinuous transitions, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 16:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

The reason for there being\nseveral models currently under consideration is that no consensus has been\nreached for how to implement the simplicity constraints. Indeed, none of these\nmodels strictly follows from the original path integral with commuting B\nfields, rather, by some non standard manipulations one always ends up with non\ncommuting B fields and the simplicity constraints become in fact anomalous\nwhich is the source for there being several inequivalent strategies to\ncircumvent the associated problems.

The latter effects were recently found in\nNb-based JJs integrated into multilayered digital circuits. E.g., it was found\nthat Josephson critical current density (Jc) may depend on the JJ's\nenvironment, on the type and size of metal layers making contact to niobium\nbase (BE) and counter electrodes (CE) of the junction, and also change with\ntime. Such Jc variations within a circuit reduce circuit performance and yield,\nand restrict integration scale. This variability of JJs is explained as caused\nby hydrogen contamination of Nb layers during wafer processing, which changes\nthe height and structural properties of AlOx tunnel barrier. Redistribution of\nhydrogen impurities between JJ electrodes and other circuit layers by diffusion\nalong Nb wires and through contacts between layers causes long-term drift of\nJc. At least two DSLs are required to completely protect JJs from impurity\ndiffusion effects - right below the junction BE and right above the junction\nCE. The simplest and the most technologically convenient DSLs we have found are\nthin (from 3 nm to 10 nm) layers of Al. They were deposited in-situ under the\nBE layer, thus forming an Al/Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb penta-layer, and under the first\nwiring layer to junctions' CE, thus forming an Al/Nb wiring bi-layer. A\nsignificant improvement of Jc uniformity on 150-mm wafer has also been obtained\nalong with large improvements in Jc targeting and run-to-run reproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 16:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

Numerical codes to study the\nbehavior, including when large non-spherical deformations are involved, have\nsince been developed and have been shown to be accurate. The situation is\nhowever different and common knowledge less advanced when the compressibility\nof the medium surrounding the bubble is provided mainly by the presence of a\nbubbly mixture. In one of the present works being carried out at DYNAFLOW,\nINC., the dynamics of a primary relatively large bubble in a water mixture\nincluding very fine bubbles is being investigated experimentally and the\nresults are being provided to several parallel on-going analytical and\nnumerical approaches. The main/primary bubble is produced by an underwater\nspark discharge from two concentric electrodes placed in the bubbly medium,\nwhich is generated using electrolysis. A grid of thin perpendicular wires is\nused to generate bubble distributions of varying intensities. The size of the\nmain bubble is controlled by the discharge voltage, the capacitors size, and\nthe pressure imposed in the container. The size and concentration of the fine\nbubbles can be controlled by the electrolysis voltage, the length, diameter,\nand type of the wires, and also by the pressure imposed in the container. This\nenables parametric study of the factors controlling the dynamics of the primary\nbubble and development of relationships between the bubble characteristic\nquantities such as maximum bubble radius and bubble period and the\ncharacteristics of the surrounding two-phase medium: micro bubble sizes and\nvoid fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 17:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Increasingly, however, cooperation is\nbeing studied in continuous games that feature a continuum of strategies\ndetermining the level of cooperative investment. For the continuous snowdrift\ngame, it has been shown that a gradually evolving monomorphic population may\nundergo evolutionary branching, resulting in the emergence of a defector\nstrategy that coexists with a cooperator strategy.

Therefore the introduced mechanism is\nreversible. Furthermore, from theoretical point of view for an infinitely slow\nrate of CRM, the relation Delta A=<W> (in common non-equilibrium simulations)\nis allowed. In this case authors of Ref. [1] must report the used infinitely\nsmall rate and justify how it is in practice valid.

An abundance matching technique is used\nto link galaxy luminosity to the host halo mass. The shape of the mass - light\nrelation at 60 micron is different from those derived at r-, K- and B-band.\nThis is because the 60 micron LF can not be fitted by a Schechter function with\na sharp exponential cutoff. We then seek the parameters in the CLFs that best\nfit the LF and power spectrum. We find that the predicted galaxy bias as a\nfunction of L60 from the best-fit model agrees well with the clustering\nmeasurements. At the faint end of the LF where quiescent star-forming galaxies\ndominate, most IRAS galaxies are central galaxies in halos of M >~ 10^{10}\nh^{-1} M_sun but a non-negligible fraction are satellites typically hosted in\nmore massive halos.

In our\nHOD modeling approach, we use the known HOD of LRGs and constrain the HOD of\nthe AGNs by a model fit to the CCF. For the first time, we are able to go\nbeyond quoting merely a `typical' AGN host halo mass, M_h, and model the full\ndistribution function of AGN host dark matter halos. In addition, we are able\nto determine the large-scale bias and the mean M_h more accurately. We explore\nthe behavior of three simple HOD models. Our first model (Model A) is a\ntruncated power-law HOD model in which all AGNs are satellites. With this\nmodel, we find an upper limit to the slope (\\alpha) of the AGN HOD that is far\nbelow unity. The other two models have a central component, which has a step\nfunction form, where the HOD is constant above a minimum mass, without (Model\nB) or with (Model C) an upper mass cutoff, in addition to the truncated\npower-law satellite component, similar to the HOD that is found for galaxies.\nIn these two models we find the upper limits of \\alpha < 0.95 and \\alpha < 0.84\nfor Model B and C respectively. Our analysis suggests that the satellite AGN\noccupation increases slower than, or may even decrease with, M_h, in contrast\nto the satellite's HODs of luminosity-threshold samples of galaxies, which, in\ncontrast, grow approximately as \\propto M_h^\\alpha with \\alpha\\approx 1.

Our\nX-ray data thus reveal the black hole as it ejects a portion of the inner\naccretion flow and then drives a wind from the outer disk, all in a bizarre\ncycle that lasts fewer than 60 seconds but can repeat for weeks. We find that\nthe accretion disk wind may be sufficiently massive to play an active role in\nGRS 1915+105, not only in quenching the jet on long timescales, but also in\npossibly producing or facilitating transitions between classes of X-ray\nvariability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Such models have attracted interest recently\nfor a variety of reasons, including the possibility of slowing the motion of\nthe inflaton on a steep potential. In this review we show that interactions\nbetween the produced particles and the inflaton condensate can lead to a\nqualitatively new mechanism for generating cosmological fluctuations from\ninflation. We illustrate this effect using a simple prototype model g^2\n(\\phi-\\phi_0)^2\\chi^2 for the interaction between the inflaton, \\phi, and\niso-inflaton, \\chi. Such interactions are quite natural in a variety of\ninflation models from supersymmetry and string theory. Using both lattice field\ntheory simulations and analytical calculations, we study the quantum production\nof \\chi particles and their subsequent rescatterings off the condensate\n\\phi(t), which generates bremsstrahlung radiation of light inflaton\nfluctuations \\delta\\phi. This mechanism leads to observable features in the\nprimordial power spectrum. We derive observational constraints on such features\nand discuss their implications for popular models of inflation, including\nbrane/axion monodromy. Inflationary particle production also leads to a very\nnovel kind of nongaussian signature which may be observable in future missions.\nWe argue that this mechanism provides a simple and well-motivated option to\ngenerate large nongaussianity, without fine-tuning the inflationary trajectory\nor appealing to re-summation of an infinite series of high dimension operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 20:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}

The heterotic theory develops an\nenhanced Sp(2k) gauge symmetry for k small instantons, besides the allowed\nSO(32) gauge symmetry. An interesting question now is to ask what happens when\nwe take the large k limit. In this paper we argue that in some special cases,\nwhere Gauss' law allows the large k limit, the dynamics of the large k small\ninstantons can be captured by a dual gravitational description. For the cases\nthat we elaborate in this paper, the gravity duals are non-Kahler manifolds\nalthough in general they could be non-geometric. These small instantons are\nheterotic five-branes and the duality allows us to study the strongly coupled\nfield theories on these five-branes. We review and elaborate on some of the\nrecent observations pointing towards this duality, and argue that in certain\ncases the gauge/gravity duality may be understood as small instanton\ntransitions under which the instantons smoothen out and consequently lose the\nSp(2k) gauge symmetry.

The work presented here describes a model for\nmatter on a causal set, specifically a theory of quantum scalar fields on a\ncausal set spacetime background.\n  The work starts with a discrete path integral model for particles on a causal\nset. Here quantum mechanical amplitudes are assigned to trajectories within the\ncausal set. By summing these over all trajectories between two spacetime events\nwe obtain a causal set particle propagator. With a suitable choice of\namplitudes this is shown to agree (in an appropriate sense) with the retarded\npropagator for the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime.\n  This causal set propagator is then used to define a causal set analogue of\nthe Pauli-Jordan function that appears in continuum quantum field theories. A\nquantum scalar field is then modelled by an algebra of operators which satisfy\nthree simple conditions (including a bosonic commutation rule). Defining\ntime-ordering through a linear extension of the causal set these field\noperators are used to define a causal set Feynman propagator.

The Feynman propagator is obtained using the\neigendecomposition of the Pauli-Jordan function, a method which can also be\napplied in continuum-based theories.\n  The free field theory is extended to include interacting scalar fields.

The causes of the\nabnormal mass loss (the so-called Be phenomenon) are as yet unknown.

We investigate the variability of the Be\nStar CoRoT-ID 102761769 observed with the CoRoT satellite in the exoplanet\nfield during the initial run. One low-resolution spectrum of the star was\nobtained with the INT telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos.\nA time series analysis was performed using both cleanest and singular spectrum\nanalysis algorithms to the CoRoT light curve. To identify the pulsation modes\nof the observed frequencies, we computed a set of models representative of\nCoRoT-ID 102761769 by varying its main physical parameters inside the\nuncertainties discussed.

We compare the\nmagnification pattern of the triple lens system with that of a best-fitted\nbinary system composed of a star and a Jovian mass planet, and check the\nprobability in detecting the low-mass secondary planet whose signature will be\nsuperposed on that of the primary Jovian mass planet. Detection probabilities\nof the low-mass planet in the triple lens system are quite similar to the\nprobability in detecting such a low-mass planet in a binary system with a star\nand only a low-mass planet, which shows that the signature of a low-mass planet\ncan be effectively detected even when it is concurrent with the signature of\nthe more massive planet, implying that the binary superposition approximation\nworks over a relatively broad range of planet mass ratio and separations, and\nthe inaccuracies thereof do not significantly affect the detection probability\nof the lower mass secondary planet. Since the signature of the Jovian mass\nplanet will be larger and lasts longer, thereby warranting more intensive\nfollow-up observations, the actual detection rate of the low-mass planet in a\ntriple system with a Jovian mass can be significantly higher than that in a\nbinary system with a low-mass planet only.

We use magnetic and non-magnetic 3D numerical simulations of solar\ngranulation and G-band radiative diagnostics from the resulting models to\nanalyse the generation of small-scale vortex motions in the solar photosphere.\nMethods. Radiative MHD simulations of magnetoconvection are used to produce\nphotospheric models. Our starting point is a non-magnetic model of solar\nconvection, where we introduce a uniform magnetic field and follow the\nevolution of the field in the simulated photosphere. We find two different\ntypes of photospheric vortices, and provide a link between the vorticity\ngeneration and the presence of the intergranular magnetic field.

Results. Two different\ntypes of photospheric vorticity, magnetic and non-magnetic, are generated in\nthe domain. Nonmagnetic vortices are generated by the baroclinic motions of the\nplasma in the photosphere, while magnetic vortices are produced by the magnetic\ntension in the intergranular magnetic flux concentrations. The two types of\nvortices have different shapes. We find that the vorticity is generated more\nefficiently in the magnetised model.

In particular we show that\nthe presence of anisotropic stresses in EDE models can substantially undermine\nthe determination of the EDE sound speed parameter c_s^2. The constraints on\nEDE primordial energy density are however unaffected. We also calculate the\nfuture CMB constraints on neutrino masses and find that they are weakened by a\nfactor of 2 when allowing for the presence of EDE, and highly biased if it is\nincorrectly ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 09:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

For the PSF on\n$AdS$ space it is shown that it can be derived by lifting the PSF on flat space\nby a simple kernel which contains the sum over all spins. Finally we use an\nalgorithm to derive all symmetric tensor higher spin fields. They arise from\nmonomials of scalar fields by derivation and selection of conformal\n(quasiprimary) fields. Typically one monomial produces a multiplet of spin $s$\nconformal higher spin fields for all $s \\geq 4$, they are distinguished by\ntheir anomalous dimensions (in $CFT_3$) or by their mass (in $AdS_4$). We sum\nover these multiplets and the spins to obtain \"string type fields\", one for\neach such monomial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 09:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Such lack of equilibrium is also\nimposed by the feedback of the radiative processes into the ISM flow.

However, recombination time scales of most of the\nions below 1E6 K are longer than the cooling time scale. This implies that the\nrecombination lags behind and the plasma is overionized while it cools. As a\nconsequence cooling deviates from CIE. This has severe implications on the\nevolution of the ISM flow and its ionization structure.

Presently, the\nignorance on the origin of the features represents a systematic error in the\nextraction of astrophysical parameters as well as for background estimates for\nindirect dark matter searches. We find that the spectral modifications are\nappreciable above 100 GeV, and can be responsible for ~30% effects for\nantiprotons at energies close to 1 TeV or for gamma's at energies close to 300\nGeV, compared to currently considered predictions based on simple extrapolation\nof input fluxes from low energy data. Alternatively, if the feature originates\nfrom local sources, uncorrelated spectral changes might show up in antiproton\nand high-energy gamma-rays, with the latter ones likely dependent from the\nline-of-sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 13:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 15:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

The energy\ndissipation is caused by an AC gate voltage. The case of a strong Coulomb\nblockade is considered. We focus on the regime when electron coherence can be\nneglected but quantum fluctuations of charge are strong due to Coulomb\ninteraction. We obtain the admittance under the specified conditions. It turns\nout that the energy dissipation rate can be expressed via charge relaxation\nresistance and renormalized gate capacitance even out of equilibrium. We\nsuggest the admittance as a tool for a measurement of the bosonic distribution\ncorresponding collective excitations in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 14:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

During one\nof the observations, the symbiotic binary SMC3 was found at its highest X-ray\nluminosity observed until now. In SMC3 wind accretion from a giant donor star\nonto a white dwarf is believed to cause steady hydrogen burning on the white\ndwarf surface, making such systems candidates for supernova type Ia\nprogenitors. It was suggested that the X-ray source is eclipsed every ~4.5\nyears by the companion star and its stellar wind to explain the large X-ray\nvariability seen in ROSAT data. We use the available X-ray data to test this\nscenario. We present the ~20 year X-ray light curve of SMC3 and study the\nspectral evolution as seen with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn to investigate possible\nscenarios which can reproduce the high X-ray variability. We did not find\nsignificant variations in the photo-electric absorption, as it would be\nexpected during eclipse ingress and egress. Instead, the X-ray spectra from\ndifferent intensity levels, when modelled by black-body emission, can be better\nexplained by variations either in normalisation (by a factor of ~50) or in\ntemperature (kT between 24 eV and 34 eV). The light curve shows maxima and\nminima with slow transitions between them. To explain the gradual variations in\nthe X-ray light curve and to avoid changes in absorption by neutral gas, a\npredominant part of the stellar wind must be ionised by the X-ray source.\nCompton scattering with variable electron column density (of the order of 5 x\n10^24 cm^-2) along the line of sight could then be responsible for the\nintensity changes. The X-ray variability of SMC3 could also be caused by\ntemperature changes in the hydrogen burning envelope of the white dwarf, an\neffect which could even dominate if the stellar wind density is not\nsufficiently high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 14:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We also find that the data is not well represented by\nrandom lines of sight to the BAL gas. Our best fit indicates two classes of\nLoBALQSOs, the majority ($\\approx 2/3$) are polar outflows, that are\nresponsible for the enhanced frequency of narrow line profiles, and the\nremainder are equatorial outflows. We further motivated the line of sight\nexplanation of the narrow line excess in LoBALQSOs by considering the notion\nthat the skewed distribution of line profiles is driven by an elevated\nEddington ratio in BALQSOs. We constructed a variety of control samples\ncomprised of nonLoBALQSOs matched to a de-reddened LoBALQSO sample in redshift,\nluminosity, black hole mass and Eddington ratio. It is demonstrated that the\nexcess of narrow profiles persists within the LoBALQSO sample relative to each\nof the control samples with no reduction of the statistical significance.

The first one was\nintroduced by Rauzy and was in particular used by Veech to prove the ergodicity\nof the Teichm\\\"uller flow. The second one is more recent and uses a \"labeling\"\nof the underlying intervals, and was used in the proof of some recent major\nresults about the Teichm\\\"uller flow. The Rauzy diagrams obtained from the\nsecond definition are coverings of the initial ones. In this paper, we give a\nformula that gives the degree of this covering. This formula is related to\nmoduli spaces of \"framed\" translation surfaces, which corresponds to surfaces\nwhere we label horizontal separatrices on the surface. We compute the number of\nconnected component of these natural coverings of the moduli spaces of\ntranslation surfaces. Delecroix proved recently a recursive formula for the\ncardinality of the (reduced) Rauzy classes. Therefore, we also obtain a formula\nfor labeled Rauzy classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 15:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}

In general, there is a whole class of DAGs\nthat represents a given set of conditional independence relations. We are\ninterested in properties of this class that can be derived from observations of\na subsystem only. To this end, we prove an information theoretic inequality\nthat allows for the inference of common ancestors of observed parts in any DAG\nrepresenting some unknown larger system. More explicitly, we show that a large\namount of dependence in terms of mutual information among the observations\nimplies the existence of a common ancestor that distributes this information.\nWithin the causal interpretation of DAGs our result can be seen as a\nquantitative extension of Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause to more than\ntwo variables. Our conclusions are valid also for non-probabilistic\nobservations such as binary strings, since we state the proof for an\naxiomatized notion of mutual information that includes the stochastic as well\nas the algorithmic version.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 15:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-28"}
