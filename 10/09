Both of the attitude dynamics and the proposed\ncontrol system are globally expressed on the special orthogonal group, to avoid\ncomplexities and ambiguities associated with other attitude representations\nsuch as Euler angles or quaternions. By selecting an attitude error function\ncarefully, we show that the proposed control system guarantees a desirable\ntracking performance uniformly for nontrivial rotational maneuvers involving a\nlarge initial attitude error. In a special case where the desired attitude\ncommand is fixed, we also show that the attitude dynamics can be stabilized\nwithout the knowledge of an inertia matrix. These are illustrated by numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 16:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-11"}

In this paper we present a lower bound for squashed entanglement in\nterms of a distance to the set of separable states. This implies that squashed\nentanglement is faithful, that is, strictly positive if and only if the state\nis entangled. We derive the bound on squashed entanglement from a bound on\nquantum conditional mutual information, which is used to define squashed\nentanglement and corresponds to the amount by which strong subadditivity of von\nNeumann entropy fails to be saturated. Our result therefore sheds light on the\nstructure of states that almost satisfy strong subadditivity with equality. The\nproof is based on two recent results from quantum information theory: the\noperational interpretation of the quantum mutual information as the optimal\nrate for state redistribution and the interpretation of the regularised\nrelative entropy of entanglement as an error exponent in hypothesis testing.\nThe distance to the set of separable states is measured by the one-way LOCC\nnorm, an operationally-motivated norm giving the optimal probability of\ndistinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using\nany protocol formed by local quantum operations and one-directional classical\ncommunication between the parties. A similar result for the Frobenius or\nEuclidean norm follows immediately. The result has two applications in\ncomplexity theory. The first is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm solving the\nweak membership problem for the set of separable states in one-way LOCC or\nEuclidean norm. The second concerns quantum Merlin-Arthur games.

The data for such a process are a\ndrift vector {\\theta}, a nonsingular d \\times d covariance matrix {\\Sigma}, and\na d \\times d reflection matrix R. A standard problem is to determine under what\nconditions the process is positive recurrent.

Detections of several\nmolecules, including H20, CH4 and CO2, have been claimed for HD 189733 and\nXO-1, but similarly sized features are attributed to systematic noise for\nGJ-436. The data consist of time-series grism spectra covering a planetary\ntransit. After extracting light curves in independent wavelength channels, we\nuse a linear decorrelation technique account for instrumental systematics\n(which is becoming standard in the field), and measure the planet-to-star\nradius ratio as a function of wavelength. For HD 189733, the uncertainties in\nthe transmission spectrum are significantly larger than those previously\nreported. We also find the transmission spectrum is considerably altered when\nusing different out-of-transit orbits to remove the systematics, when some\nparameters are left out of the decorrelation procedure, or when we perform the\ndecorrelation with quadratic functions rather than linear functions. Given that\nthere is no physical reason to believe the baseline flux should be modelled as\na linear function of any particular set of parameters, we interpret this as\nevidence that the linear decorrelation technique is not a robust method to\nremove systematic effects from the light curves for each wavelength channel.\nFor XO-1, the parameters measured to decorrelate the light curves would require\nextrapolation to the in-transit orbit to remove the systematics, and we cannot\nreproduce the previously reported results. We conclude that the resulting\nNICMOS transmission spectra are too dependent on the method used to remove\nsystematics to be considered robust detections of molecular species in\nplanetary atmospheres, although the presence of these molecules is not ruled\nout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 18:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We present here a global\nmathematical model dedicated to cities that permits describing, manipulating\nand explaining cities' overall shape and layout of their street systems. This\nstreet-based framework conciliates the topological and geometrical sides of the\nproblem. From the static analysis of several French towns (topology of first\nand second order, anisotropy, streets scaling) we make the hypothesis that the\ndevelopment of a city follows a logic of division / extension of space. We\npropose a dynamical model that mimics this logic and which from simple general\nrules and a few parameters succeeds in generating a large diversity of cities\nand in reproducing the general features the static analysis has pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 18:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 09:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The beta-divergence is a family of cost\nfunctions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the\nEuclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito\ndivergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed\nalgorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of\nthe criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM)\nalgorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard\nheuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The\nmonotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1)\nusing the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of\nmajorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along\nconstant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM.\nSimulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the\nME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be\nadapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty\nfunction of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF\n(when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2010 18:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 17:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2011 12:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-09"}

We introduce a novel way to compute a lower bound on the\npositive real roots of univariate polynomials. This allows us to derive a worst\ncase bound of $\\sOB(d^6 + d^4\\tau^2 + d^3\\tau^2)$ for isolating the real roots\nof a polynomial with integer coefficients using the classic variant of CF,\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the polynomial and $\\tau$ the maximum bitsize of its\ncoefficients. This improves the previous bound by Sharma \\cite{sharma-tcs-2008}\nby a factor of $d^3$ and matches the bound derived by Mehlhorn and Ray\n\\cite{mr-jsc-2009} for another variant of CF; it also matches the worst case\nbound of the subdivision-based solvers.

Therefore, a new finite strain generalization of\nelastoplastic coupling theory is given to describe the mechanical behaviour of\nmaterials evolving from a granular to a dense state. The correct account of\nelastoplastic coupling and of the specific characteristics of materials\nevolving from a loose to a dense state (for instance, nonlinear --or linear--\ndependence of the elastic part of the deformation on the forming pressure in\nthe granular --or dense-- state) makes the use of existing large strain\nformulations awkward, if even possible.

Since optical\nwavelength is on a much larger microscale, it is impossible to employ\nconventional focusing for that purpose. We show the strong optically-induced\ninteractions between discrete meta-molecules in a metamaterial system and\ncoherent monochromatic continuous light beam with a spatially-tailored phase\nprofile can be used to prepare a sub-wavelength scale energy localization. Well\nisolated energy hot-spots as small as $\\lambda/10$ can be created and\npositioned at will on the metamaterial landscape offering new opportunities for\ndata storage and imaging applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2010 15:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2010 10:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-03"}
