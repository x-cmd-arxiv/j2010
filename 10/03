As a result, rather than the mass-eigenstate vacuum, the correct\nground state to describe the underlying dynamics is the flavour vacuum,\nproposed some time ago by Blasone and Vitiello as a description of quantum\nfield theories with mixing. At the microscopic level, the breaking of\ntarget-space supersymmetry is induced in our space-time foam model by the\nrelative transverse motion of brane defects. Motivated by these results, we\nshow that the flavour vacuum, introduced through an inequivalent representation\nof the canonical (anti-) commutation relations, provides a vehicle for the\nbreaking of supersymmetry (SUSY) at a low-energy effective field theory level;\non considering the flavour-vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum\ntensor and comparing with the form of a perfect relativistic fluid, it is found\nthat the bosonic sector contributes as dark energy while the fermion\ncontribution is like dust. This indicates a strong and novel breaking of SUSY,\nof a non-perturbative nature, which may characterize the low energy field\ntheory of certain quantum gravity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 16:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 17:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-12"}

The present paper is an attempt to describe\nwhich constructions carry over from the function field case to the p-adic case,\nmore precisely to the situation of the p-adic affine Grassmannian for the\nspecial linear group G=SL_n.

Using 3-D SPH simulations of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion of the O-star wind\nonto the companion, we find that the orbital phase variation of the accretion\nfollows very closely the simple Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) rate for the local\nradius and wind speed. Moreover, a simple model, wherein intrinsic emission of\ngamma-rays is assumed to track this accretion rate, reproduces quite well Fermi\nobservations of the phase variation of gamma-rays in the energy range 0.1-10\nGeV. However for the VHE (0.1-30 TeV) radiation observed by the HESS Cerenkov\ntelescope, it is important to account also for photon-photon interactions\nbetween the gamma-rays and the stellar optical/UV radiation, which effectively\nattenuates much of the strong emission near periastron. When this is included,\nwe find that this simple BHL accretion model also quite naturally fits the HESS\nlight curve, thus making it a strong alternative to the pulsar-wind-shock\nmodels commonly invoked to explain such VHE gamma-ray emission in massive-star\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2010 19:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 17:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In particular, we focus this\nanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, as\nwell as their clustering properties. We constructed 100 quasi-independent mock\ncatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in De Lucia\n& Blaizot (2007).We then applied the same observational selection function of\nthe VVDS-Deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models and\nobservations.

Model\ngalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement with\nthe data. In particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the number\nof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed by\nVVDS-Deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observed\ngalaxies is absent from the model.

To investigate thermal properties of single molecule DNA\nwe have developed a 3D coarse-grained (CG) model that retains the realism of\nthe full all-atom description, but is significantly more efficient. Within the\nproposed model each nucleotide is represented by 6 particles or grains; the\ngrains interact via effective potentials inferred from classical molecular\ndynamics (MD) trajectories based on a well-established all-atom potential\nfunction. Comparisons of 10 ns long MD trajectories between the CG and the\ncorresponding all-atom model show similar root-mean-square deviations from the\ncanonical B-form DNA, and similar structural fluctuations. At the same time,\nthe CG model is 10 to 100 times faster depending on the length of the DNA\nfragment in the simulation. Analysis of dispersion curves derived from the CG\nmodel yields longitudinal sound velocity and torsional stiffness in close\nagreement with existing experiments. The computational efficiency of the CG\nmodel makes it possible to calculate thermal conductivity of a single DNA\nmolecule not yet available experimentally. For a uniform (polyG-polyC) DNA, the\nestimated conductivity coefficient is 0.3 W/mK which is half the value of\nthermal conductivity for water.

By analyzing\n47 active regions observed by SOHO/MDI without using signal filters, we have\ndetermined the coefficients of surface absorption, deep absorption, emissivity\nreduction, and local suppression. The dissipation in the quiet Sun is derived\nas well. All of the cross-covariances are width corrected to offset the effect\nof dispersion.

The nucleons, the scalar isoscalar meson, $\\sigma$\nand the scalar-isovector meson, $\\delta$ as modified in the strange hadronic\nmatter, modify the masses of $D$ and $\\bar{D}$ mesons. It is found that as\ncompared to the $\\bar{D}$ mesons, the $D$ meson properties are more sensitive\nto the isospin asymmetry at high densities. The effects of strangeness in the\nmedium on the properties of $D$ and $\\bar{D}$ mesons are studied in the present\ninvestigation. The $D$ mesons ($D^0$,$D^+$) are found to undergo larger medium\nmodifications as compared to $\\bar{D}$ mesons ($\\bar {D^0}$, $D^-$) with the\nstrangeness fraction, $f_s$ and these modifications are observed to be more\nappreciable at high densities.

The weakly anisotropic distribution\nof accelerated particles, i.e., cosmic rays (CRs), is believed capable of\nproducing this turbulence in a symbiotic relationship where the magnetic\nturbulence required to accelerate the CRs is created by the accelerated CRs\nthemselves. In efficient DSA, this wave-particle interaction can be strongly\nnonlinear where CRs modify the plasma flow and the specific mechanisms of\nmagnetic field amplification. Resonant interactions have long been known to\namplify magnetic fluctuations on the scale of the CR gyroradius, and Bell\n(2004) showed that the CR current can efficiently amplify magnetic fluctuations\nwith scales smaller than the CR gyroradius. Here, we show with a multi-scale,\nquasi-linear analysis that the presence of turbulence with scales shorter than\nthe CR gyroradius enhances the growth of modes with scales longer than the\ngyroradius, at least for particular polarizations. We use a mean-field approach\nto average the equation of motion and the induction equation over the ensemble\nof magnetic field oscillations accounting for the anisotropy of relativistic\nparticles on the background plasma. We derive the response of the magnetized CR\ncurrent on magnetic field fluctuations and show that, in the presence of\nshort-scale, Bell-type turbulence, long wavelength modes are amplified. The\npolarization, helicity, and angular dependence of the growth rates are\ncalculated for obliquely propagating modes for wavelengths both below and above\nthe CR mean free path. The long wavelength growth rates we estimate for typical\nsupernova remnant parameters are sufficiently fast to suggest a fundamental\nincrease in the maximum CR energy a given shock can produce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2010 14:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Several\nattempts have been tried to correct the projection effects, which however led\nto a too large average velocity probably due to the biased choice of the CME\nevents. In order to estimate the overall influence of the projection effects on\nthe kinematic properties of the CMEs, we perform a forward modeling of the real\ndistributions of the CME properties, such as the velocity, the angular width,\nand the latitude, by requiring their projected distributions to best match the\nobservations.
