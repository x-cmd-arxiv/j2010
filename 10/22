On the level of phenomenology,\nthis idea means raison d'etre for particle flavor since it requires more than\none mass copy i.e. transition from individual particle mass to the concept of\nmass-matrix. In this paper that idea is exemplified by a generic system of\naccurate empirical relations for dimensionless flavor-electroweak quantities\n(fine structure constant, muon-electron and tauon-electron mass ratios and\nquark CKM and neutrino PMNS mixing angles) build in terms of one small\nuniversal e-parameter as mediator of mass-matrix and charge quantities. The\nused in this study empirically suggested math paradigm consists of repeated\nexponentiation of e-powers. Accuracy boost of flavor relations from replacement\nof e-power terms by exponential f-terms is observed. The two widely discussed\nin the literature empirical flavor regularities, quark-lepton complementarity\n(QLC) and Koide charged lepton mass formula, are essential parts of the generic\nsystem. Solar neutrino mixing angle is predicted {\\theta}sol= 34.05o by\nextension of QLC. Charged lepton mass ratios satisfy Koide relation with high\naccuracy ~10-9.

These\ninsulators are not required to have gapless boundary modes in the energy\nspectrum. However, they do exhibit protected modes in the entanglement spectrum\nlocalized on the cut between two entangled regions. Their entanglement entropy\ncannot be made to vanish adiabatically, and hence the insulators can be called\ntopological. There is a direct connection between the inversion eigenvalues of\nthe band structure and the mid-gap states in the entanglement spectrum. The\nclassification of protected entanglement levels is given by an integer $n\\in\nZ$, which is the difference between the negative inversion eigenvalues at\ninversion symmetric points in the Brillouin zone, taken in sets of two. When\nthe Hamiltonian describes a Chern insulator or a non-trivial T-invariant\ntopological insulator, the entanglement spectrum exhibits spectral flow. If the\nChern number is zero for the former, or T is broken in the latter, the\nentanglement spectrum does \\emph{not} have spectral flow, but, depending on the\ninversion eigenvalues, can still have protected midgap bands. Although spectral\nflow is broken, the mid-gap entanglement bands cannot be adiabatically removed,\nand the insulator is `topological.' In 1D, we establish a link between the\nproduct of the inversion eigenvalues of all occupied bands at all inversion\nmomenta and charge polarization. In 2D, we prove a link between the product of\nthe inversion eigenvalues and the parity of the Chern number.

We explore quantitatively how the\nbrain might cope with this inherent source of error by taking advantage of two\nubiquitous mechanisms, redundancy and synchronization. In particular we\nconsider a neural process whose goal is to learn a decision function by\nimplementing a nonlinear gradient dynamics. The dynamics, however, are assumed\nto be corrupted by perturbations modeling the error which might be incurred due\nto limitations of the biology, intrinsic neuronal noise, and imperfect\nmeasurements. We show that error, and the associated uncertainty surrounding a\nlearned solution, can be controlled in large part by trading off\nsynchronization strength among multiple redundant neural systems against the\nnoise amplitude. The impact of the coupling between such redundant systems is\nquantified by the spectrum of the network Laplacian, and we discuss the role of\nnetwork topology in synchronization and in reducing the effect of noise. A\nrange of situations in which the mechanisms we model arise in brain science are\ndiscussed, and we draw attention to experimental evidence suggesting that\ncortical circuits capable of implementing the computations of interest here can\nbe found on several scales.

The electronic quasiparticles reside near pocket Fermi\nsurfaces enclosing total area x (the dopant density), centered away from the\nmagnetic Brillouin zone boundary. The violation of the conventional Luttinger\ntheorem is linked to a 'species doubling' of these quasiparticles. We describe\nphenomenological theories of the pairing of these quasiparticles, and show that\na large class of mean-field theories generically displays a nodal-anti-nodal\n`dichotomy': the interplay of local antiferromagnetism and pairing leads to a\nsmall gap near the nodes of the d-wave pairing along the Brillouin zone\ndiagonals, and a large gap in the anti-nodal region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 08:56:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 22:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-08"}

We\ncompute the generalized scaling function at two-loop order f_2(ell) both for\nsmall and large values of ell matching the predictions based on the asymptotic\nBethe ansatz. In particular, in the small ell expansion, we derive an exact\nintegral form for the ell-dependent coefficient of the Catalan's constant term\nin f_2(ell). Also, by resumming a certain subclass of multi-loop Feynman\ndiagrams we obtain an exact expression for the leading (ln ell) part of\nf(lambda^(1/2), ell) which is valid to any order in the alpha'~1/lambda^(1/2)\nexpansion.

Coulomb interactions couple the interfering edge mode to localized\nquasiparticle states in the bulk, whose occupation is quantized in integer\nvalues. For the integer quantum Hall effect, if the bulk-edge coupling is\nabsent, the resistance exhibits an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) periodicity, where the\nphase is equal to the number of quanta of magnetic flux enclosed by a specified\ninterferometer area. When bulk-edge coupling is present, the actual area of the\ninterferometer oscillates as function of B and V_G, with a combination of a\nsmooth variation and abrupt jumps due to changes in the number of\nquasi-particles in the bulk of the interferometer. This modulates the\nAharonov-Bohm phase and gives rise to additional periodicities in the\nresistance. In the limit of strong interactions, the amplitude of the AB\noscillations becomes negligible, and one sees only the new \"Coulomb-dominated\"\n(CD) periodicity. In the limits where either the AB or the CD periodicities\ndominate, a color map of resistance will show a series of parallel stripes in\nthe B-V_G plane, but the two cases show different stripe spacings and slopes of\nopposite signs.

In a favorable case, the light of a background star can\nbe subject to stochastic fluctuations on the order of a few percent at a\ncharacteristic time scale of a few minutes. Our ultimate aim is to discover or\nexclude these scintillation effects to estimate the contribution of molecular\nhydrogen to the Galactic baryonic hidden mass. This feasibility study is a\npathfinder toward an observational strategy to search for scintillation,\nprobing the sensitivity of future surveys and estimating the background level.\nMethods: We searched for scintillation induced by molecular gas in visible dark\nnebulae as well as by hypothetical halo clumpuscules of cool molecular hydrogen\n($\\mathrm{H_2-He}$) during two nights. We took long series of 10s infrared\nexposures with the ESO-NTT telescope toward stellar populations located behind\nvisible nebulae and toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We therefore\nsearched for stars exhibiting stochastic flux variations similar to what is\nexpected from the scintillation effect. According to our simulations of the\nscintillation process, this search should allow one to detect (stochastic)\ntransverse gradients of column density in cool Galactic molecular clouds of\norder of $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^2/10\\,000\\,km}$. Results: We found\none light-curve that is compatible with a strong scintillation effect through a\nturbulent structure characterized by a diffusion radius $R_{diff}<100\\, km$ in\nthe B68 nebula. Complementary observations are needed to clarify the status of\nthis candidate, and no firm conclusion can be established from this single\nobservation. We can also infer limits on the existence of turbulent dense cores\n(of number density $n>10^9\\, cm^{-3}$) within the dark nebulae. Because no\ncandidate is found toward the SMC, we are also able to establish upper limits\non the contribution of gas clumpuscules to the Galactic halo mass. Conclusions:\nThe limits set by this test do not seriously constrain the known models, but we\nshow that the short time-scale monitoring for a few $10^6 star\\times hour$ in\nthe visible band with a $>4$ meter telescope and a fast readout camera should\nallow one to quantify the contribution of turbulent molecular gas to the\nGalactic halo.

Some r-process-rich (hereafter r-rich) metal-poor stars, such as\nHD221170, show an overabundance of the heavier neutron-capture elements and\nexcesses of lighter neutron-capture elements. The study of these r-rich stars\ncould give us a better understanding of weak and main r-process nucleosynthesis\nat low metallicity. Based on conclusions from the observation of metal-poor\nstars and neutron-capture element nucleosynthesis theory, we set up a model to\ndetermine the relative contributions from weak and main r-processes to the\nheavy-element abundances in metal-poor stars. Using this model, we find that\nthe abundance patterns of light elements for most sample stars are close to the\npattern of weak r-process stars, and those of heavier neutron-capture elements\nvery similar to the pattern of main r-process stars, while the lighter\nneutron-capture elements can be fitted by the mixing of weak and main r-process\nmaterial. The production of weak r-process elements appears to be associated\nwith the light elements, while the production of main r-process elements is\nalmost decoupled from that of the light elements. We compare our results with\nthe observed data at low metallicities, showing that the predicted trends are\nin good agreement with the observed trends, at least for the metallicity range\n[Fe/H] < -2.1.

For certain values of illumination the medium\nswitches to a sub-excitable mode. An asymmetric perturbation of the medium\nleads to formation of a travelling localized excitation, a wave-fragment which\nmoves along a predetermined trajectory, ideally preserving its shape and\nvelocity. To implement collision-based computing with such wave-fragments we\nrepresent values of Boolean variables in presence/absence of a wave-fragment at\nspecific sites of medium. When two wave-fragments collide they either\nannihilate, or form new wave-fragments. The trajectories of the wave-fragments\nafter the collision represent a result of the computation, e.g. a simple\nlogical gate. Wave-fragments in the sub-excitable medium are famously difficult\nto control. Therefore, we adopted a hybrid procedure in order to construct\ncollision-based logical gates: we used channels, defined by lower levels\nillumination to subtly tune the shape of a propagating wave-fragment and allow\nthe wave-fragments to collide at the junctions between channels. Using this\nmethodology we were able to implement both in theoretical models (using the\nOregonator) and in experiment two interaction-based logical gates and assemble\nthe gates into a basic one-bit binary adder. We present the first ever\nexperimental approach towards constructing arithmetical circuits in\nspatially-extended excitable chemical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 12:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

In all the seven clusters displaying a\nsignificant u-g color spread, we find that the stars on the red and blue sides\nof the RGB, in (g, u-g) color magnitude diagrams, have significantly different\nradial distributions.

Some scholars have proposed that information\nshould provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that\nany behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must\nnecessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by\nproviding a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a\nparticular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a\nfood source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates\nthe statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the\ncreature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision\nprocess. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite\ndimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining\nthat reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of \"information\nstates\". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the\nperformance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other\ncandidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information\noptimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.\nThe rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not\npredict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of\ndifferent strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,\nin particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there\nis no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral\noptimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple\ntradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the\nfood itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 14:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-25"}

These events were detected and\ntheir multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument\nat the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four\none-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at\nthe VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and\nto measure their redshifts. Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve\nmodeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak\nmagnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a\nprecise calibration of the SNLS fields. A flat LambdaCDM cosmological fit to\n231 SNLS high redshift Type Ia supernovae alone gives Omega_M = 0.211 +/-\n0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from\nuncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from\nlight curve fitters come next with a total contribution of +/- 0.026 on\nOmega_M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope\n(beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 15:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Generally, it is hard to achieve such a large CP violation\nconsistently with other experimental constraints.

The empirical research of these two points would lead\nto early warning of economic crisis. Moreover, it is a surprise that the state\nof economic crisis would be a feasible equilibrium within the framework of the\nArrow-Debreu model.
