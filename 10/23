In this work, we investigate the structure of the wind of V374Peg\nby means of 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations. For the first\ntime, an observationally derived surface magnetic field map is implemented in\nMHD models of stellar winds for a low mass star. We show that the wind of\nV374Peg deviates greatly from a low-velocity, low-mass-loss rate solar-type\nwind. We find general scaling relations for the terminal velocities, mass-loss\nrates, and spin-down times of highly magnetized M dwarfs. In particular, for\nV374Peg, our models show that terminal velocities across a range of stellar\nlatitudes reach ~(1500-2300) n_{12}^{-1/2} km/s, where n_{12} is the coronal\nwind base density in units of 10^{12} cm^{-3}, while the mass-loss rates are\nabout 4 x 10^{-10} n_{12}^{1/2} Msun/yr. We also evaluate the angular-momentum\nloss of V374Peg, which presents a rotational braking timescale ~28\nn_{12}^{-1/2} Myr. Compared to observationally derived values from period\ndistributions of stars in open clusters, this suggests that V374Peg may have\nlow coronal base densities (< 10^{11} cm^{-3}). We show that the wind ram\npressure of V374Peg is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than for the solar\nwind. Nevertheless, a small planetary magnetic field intensity (~ 0.1G) is able\nto shield a planet orbiting at 1 AU against the erosive effects of the stellar\nwind. However, planets orbiting inside the habitable zone of V374Peg, where the\nwind ram pressure is higher, might be facing a more significant atmospheric\nerosion. In that case, higher planetary magnetic fields of, at least, about\nhalf the magnetic field intensity of Jupiter, are required to protect the\nplanet's atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 17:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2011 14:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-07"}

Separating this emission from that associated with\nextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. In this paper we discuss\na particular case, the M81 group, and the identification of diffuse structures\nprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. The origin\nof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them being\nthe result of a past interaction between M81 and M82 or due to more local\nGalactic emission. We show that over of order a few arcminute scales the\nfar-infrared (Herschel 250 &\\mu&m) emission correlates spatially very well with\na particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the Galactic HI. We find\nno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with these\nfeatures actually originates in the M81 group. Thus we infer that the\nassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light back\nscattered off dust in our galaxy. Ultra-violet observations pick out young\nstellar associations around M81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. We\nconsider in detail one of the Galactic cirrus features, finding that the\nfar-infrared HI relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that at\nsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 18:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

At the core of the argument lies\nthe observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction,\ncould cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with generalist\npollinators.

First, there is a tendency to increase the asymmetry of the network as a\nresult of the extinctions. Second, an entropy measure of the differential\nsusceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist species show that\nthey tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally, the\ndisappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that\nspecialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an\nassortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 19:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The consistency with that relation requires introduction of the\n(familiar for the BF theory) face amplitude. The operator spin foam models are\ndefined quite generally. Imposing a maximal symmetry leads to a family we call\nnatural operator spin foam models. This symmetry, combined with demanding\nconsistency with splitting the edges, determines a complete characterization of\na general natural model. It can be obtained by applying arbitrary (quantum)\nconstraints on an arbitrary BF spin foam model. In particular, imposing\nsuitable constraints on Spin(4) BF spin foam model is exactly the way we tend\nto view 4d quantum gravity, starting with the BC model and continuing with the\nEPRL or FK models. That makes our framework directly applicable to those\nmodels. Specifically, our operator spin foam framework can be translated into\nthe language of spin foams and partition functions.

However, in order to use Lya as a\nphysical probe of galaxies, it becomes vital to know the Lya escape fraction\n(fescLya). Unfortunately, due to the resonant nature of Lya, fescLya may vary\nunpredictably and requires empirical measurement. Here we compile Lya\nluminosity functions between redshift z=0 and 8 and, combined with H-alpha and\nultraviolet data, assess how fescLya evolves with redshift. We find a strong\nupwards evolution in fescLya over the range z=0.3-6, which is well-fit by the\npower-law fescLya \\propto (1+z)^\\xi, with \\xi =(2.57_-0.12^+0.19).

Beyond z~6.5, fescLya drops more\nsubstantially; an effect attributed to either ionizing photon leakage, or an\nincrease in the neutral gas fraction of the intergalactic medium.

These games directly relate\nto network routing problems and also job-shop scheduling problems. In typical\nbottleneck congestion games, the utility costs of the players are determined by\nthe worst congested resources that they use. However, the resulting Nash\nequilibria are inefficient, since the price of anarchy is proportional on the\nnumber of resources which can be high. Here we show that we can get smaller\nprice of anarchy with the bottleneck social cost metric. We introduce the {\\em\npolynomial bottleneck games} where the utility costs of the players are\npolynomial functions of the congestion of the resources that they use. In\nparticular, the delay function for any resource $r$ is $C_{r}^\\M$, where $C_r$\nis the congestion measured as the number of players that use $r$, and $\\M \\geq\n1$ is an integer constant that defines the degree of the polynomial. The\nutility cost of a player is the sum of the individual delays of the resources\nthat it uses. The social cost of the game remains the same, namely, it is the\nworst bottleneck resource congestion: $\\max_{r} C_r$.

This hypothesis has recently\nbeen challenged on the basis that the injection of enough supernova material to\nmatch the meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca would produce large,\nmeasureable, and unobserved collateral effects on oxygen isotopes. Here we\ncalculate again the shifts in oxygen isotopes due to injection of supernova\nmaterial in the solar nebula, using a variety of nucleosynthetic conditions of\nour own progenitor explosions. Unlike previous studies of this type, we also\nconsider the effect of non-homogeneity in abundance distribution of the\nnucleosynthesis products after the explosion. We calculate the shifts in oxygen\nisotopes due to injection of sufficient supernova material to produce the\nmeteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca, and analyze the predicted shifts in\ndetail for compatibility with meteoritic data. We find that the range in\npossible isotopic shifts is considerable and sensitive to parameters such as\nprogenitor mass and anisotropy of the explosion; however, a small number of\ncompatible scenarios do exist. Because of the wide range of outcomes and the\nsensitivity of isotopic yields to assumed conditions, it is difficult to\nconstrain the supernova that may have led to injection of 26Al in the solar\nnebula. Conversely, we argue that the existence of viable counterexamples\ndemonstrates that it is premature to use oxygen isotopes to rule out injection\nof 26Al and 41Ca into the solar nebula protoplanetary disk by a nearby\nsupernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2010 22:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The thesis is structured as follows: The first chapter explains what SAR\nis, and the physical and mathematical background is illuminated. The following\nchapter points out a problem with a divergent integral in a common approach and\nproposes an improvement. Numerical comparisons are shown that indicate that the\nimprovements allow for a superior image quality. Thereafter the problem of\nlimited data is analyzed. In a realistic SAR-measurement the data gathered from\nthe electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface can only be collected from\na limited area. However the reconstruction formula requires data from an\ninfinite distance. The chapter gives an analysis of the artifacts which can\nobscure the reconstructed images due to this problem. Additionally, some\nnumerical examples are shown that point to the severity of the problem. In\nchapter 4 the fact that data is available only from a limited area is used to\npropose a new inversion formula. This inversion formula has the potential to\nmake it easier to suppress artifacts due to limited data and, depending on the\napplication, can be refined to a fast reconstruction formula. In the\npenultimate chapter a solution to the problem of left-right ambiguity is\npresented. This problem exists since the invention of SAR and is caused by the\ngeometry of the measurements. This leads to the fact that only symmetric images\ncan be obtained. With the solution from this chapter it is possible to\nreconstruct not only the even part of the reflectivity function, but also the\nodd part, thus making it possible to reconstruct asymmetric images. Numerical\nsimulations are shown to demonstrate that this solution is not affected by\nstability problems as other approaches have been. The final chapter develops\nsome continuative ideas that could be pursued in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2010 08:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

Unlike the classical and the quantum forms of the game, Bob's\ndominant strategy in the presence of decoherence is not switching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2010 13:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 06:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

A tight connection between AGN jet kinematics and\ngamma-ray properties has been argued for, attributing the energetic emission\nfrom active galaxies to their highly relativistic outflows. We investigate the\nCaltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF) sample to study the connection between\nAGN jet kinematics and their gamma-ray properties. The high number of sources\nincluded in the sample, in addition to the excellent kinematic data available,\nallows us to investigate the origin of gamma-ray emission in AGN. We identify\nthe CJF sources detected in gamma-rays (by Fermi-LAT and EGRET). We use\ngamma-ray luminosities and the available VLBI kinematic data to look for\ncorrelations between gamma-ray and kinematic properties, as well as for\ndifferences between AGN classes (quasars, BL Lacs, radio galaxies). We also\ncheck the kinematics of the TeV sources in the CJF. 21.8% of the CJF has been\ndetected in the gamma-rays. We find the detectability of BL Lacs significantly\nhigher compared to quasars. gamma-detected sources show a wider apparent jet\nvelocity distribution compared to the non-detected ones, but the maxima of both\ndistributions are at similar values. No strong link between gamma-ray\ndetectability and fast apparent jet speeds is found. A tentative correlation is\nfound between gamma-ray luminosity and maximum apparent jet speeds, stronger\nfor BL Lac and gamma-variable sources. We find non-radial jet motions to be\nimportant to gamma-ray emission. We suggest two-zone, spine-sheath, models as a\npossible explanation to our results.
