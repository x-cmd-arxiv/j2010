These originate from tensor fluctuations\nof the metric produced during the inflationary phase. Their detection would\ntherefore constitute a major step towards understanding the primordial\nUniverse. The expected level of these anisotropies is however so small that it\nrequires a new generation of instruments with high sensitivity and extremely\ngood control of systematic effects. We propose the QUBIC instrument based on\nthe novel concept of bolometric interferometry, bringing together the\nsensitivity advantages of bolometric detectors with the systematics effects\nadvantages of interferometry. Methods: The instrument will directly observe the\nsky through an array of entry horns whose signals will be combined together\nusing an optical combiner. The whole set-up is located inside a cryostat.\nPolarization modulation will be achieved using a rotating half-wave plate and\ninterference fringes will be imaged on two focal planes (separated by a\npolarizing grid) tiled with bolometers. We show that QUBIC can be considered as\na synthetic imager, exactly similar to a usual imager but with a synthesized\nbeam formed by the array of entry horns. Scanning the sky provides an\nadditional modulation of the signal and improve the sky coverage shape. The\nusual techniques of map-making and power spectrum estimation can then be\napplied. We show that the sensitivity of such an instrument is comparable with\nthat of an imager with the same number of horns. We anticipate a low level of\nbeam-related systematics thanks to the fact that the synthesized beam is\ndetermined by the location of the primary horns. Other systematics should be\nunder good control thanks to an autocalibration technique, specific to our\nconcept, that will permit the accurate determination of most of the systematics\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 17:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A detailed\nspectroscopic analysis shows that the central region of NGC 5044 contains\nspatially varying amounts of multiphase gas. The regions with the most\ninhomogeneous gas temperature distribution tend to correlate with the extended\n235 MHz and 610 MHz radio emission detected by the GMRT. This may result from\ngas entrainment within the radio emitting plasma or mixing of different\ntemperature gas in the regions surrounding the radio emitting plasma by AGN\ninduced turbulence. Accounting for the effects of multiphase gas, we find that\nthe abundance of heavy elements is fairly uniform within the central 100 kpc,\nwith abundances of 60-80% solar for all elements except oxygen, which has a\nsignificantly sub-solar abundance. In the absence of continued AGN outbursts,\nthe gas in the center of NGC 5044 should attain a more homogeneous distribution\nof gas temperature through the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and heat\nconduction in approximately 10e8 yr. The presence of multiphase gas in NGC 5044\nindicates that the time between recent AGN outbursts has been less than\napproximately 10e8 yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 17:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

The timescales of the evolutionary\nphenomena in these two classes are proportional to the black hole (BH) masses.\nConsequently, unlike in the case of XRBs, the evolution of AGNs is too slow to\nbe followed directly. What could be done, however, is to assign particular\ntypes of active galaxies to different evolutionary stages observable in XRBs.\nWe studied such an assignment for three quasars with clear signatures of a\nrecent transition from the radio-loud to the radio-quiet state. The quasars we\ninvestigated have large-scale radio lobes that are clearly asymmetric -- one\nlobe is of Fanaroff-Riley II type, while the other one is a diffuse relic\ndevoid of a hotspot. We suggest that the prime cause of the asymmetry of these\nradio sources is that the nuclei of their host galaxies currently produce no\njets. To prove that, we observed them with milliarcsecond resolution to check\nif they are similar to those in radio-quiet quasars. The observations carried\nout with the EVN revealed that the nuclei of the quasars under investigation\nare not of a core-jet type that is characteristic for radio-loud,\nlobe-dominated quasars. It follows that the lobes are no longer fuelled and\nthat the apparent asymmetry results from the orientation, which causes a time\nlag of the order of 10^6 years between their images: the lobe perceived as a\nrelic is nearer than the lobe with a hotspot and so it is observed in a later\nstage of the decay. The three AGNs under investigation were radio-loud earlier,\nbut now they have switched to the radio-quiet state. In the framework of the\nXRB/AGN unification, the above means that they have left the very high state\nand have moved now to the high/soft state.

The basic idea of the new approach\nis similar to the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM). The GFM relies on corrections\napplied on nodes located across the interface for discretization stencils that\nstraddle the interface. If the corrections are solution-independent, they can\nbe moved to the right-hand-side (RHS) of the equations, producing a problem\nwith the same linear system as if there were no jumps, only with a different\nRHS. However, achieving high accuracy is very hard (if not impossible) with the\n\"standard\" approaches used to compute the GFM correction terms.\n  In this paper we generalize the GFM correction terms to a correction\nfunction, defined on a band around the interface. This function is then shown\nto be characterized as the solution to a PDE, with appropriate boundary\nconditions. This PDE can, in principle, be solved to any desired order of\naccuracy. As an example, we apply this new method to devise a 4th order\naccurate scheme for the constant coefficients Poisson equation with\ndiscontinuities in 2D. This scheme is based on (i) the standard 9-point stencil\ndiscretization of the Poisson equation, (ii) a representation of the correction\nfunction in terms of bicubics, and (iii) a solution of the correction function\nPDE by a least squares minimization. Several applications of the method are\npresented to illustrate its robustness dealing with a variety of interface\ngeometries, its capability to capture sharp discontinuities, and its high\nconvergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 18:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2011 13:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-30"}

The two grand-design spirals show a clear two-armed structure,\nwhile NGC 6946 is more complex. We examine these arm and interarm regions,\nlooking at maps that trace recent star formation - far-ultraviolet (GALEX NGS)\nand 24 micron emission (Spitzer, SINGS) - and cold gas - CO (Heracles) and HI\n(Things). We find the star formation tracers and CO more concentrated in the\nspiral arms than the stellar 3.6 micron flux. If we define the spiral arms as\nthe 25% highest pixels in the filtered 3.6 micron images, we find that the\nmajority (60%) of star formation tracers occurs in the interarm regions; this\nresult persists qualitatively even when considering the potential impact of\nfinite data resolution and diffuse interarm 24 micron emission. Even with a\ngenerous definition of the arms (45% highest pixels), interarm regions still\ncontribute at least 30% to the integrated star formation rate tracers. We look\nfor evidence that spiral arms trigger star or cloud formation using the ratios\nof star formation rate (SFR, traced by a combination of FUV and 24 micron\nemission) to H_2 (traced by CO) and H_2 to HI. Any enhancement of SFR / M(H_2)\nin the arm region is very small (less than 10%) and the grand design spirals\nshow no enhancement compared to the flocculent target. Arm regions do show a\nweak enhancement in H_2/HI compared to the interarm regions, but at a fixed gas\nsurface density there is little clear enhancement in the H_2/HI ratio in the\narm regions.

Methods: We acquired deep K-band\nimages of 14 bright nearby early-type galaxies.

Previous measurements revealed a strong\nmodification to dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions with\nrespect to p+p and d+Au collisions. The modification increases with the\ncollision centrality, suggesting a path-length or energy density dependence to\nthe jet-quenching effect. This paper reports STAR measurements of dihadron\nazimuthal correlations in mid-central (20-60%) Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=200$ GeV as a function of the trigger particle's\nazimuthal angle relative to the event plane, $\\phi_s=|\\phi_t-\\psi_{\\rm EP}|$.\nThe azimuthal correlation is studied as a function of both the trigger and\nassociated particle $p_T$. The subtractions of the combinatorial background and\nanisotropic flow, assuming Zero Yield At Minimum (ZYAM), are described. The\ncorrelation results are first discussed with subtraction of the even harmonic\n(elliptic and quadrangular) flow backgrounds. The away-side correlation is\nstrongly modified, and the modification varies with $\\phi_s$, with a\ndouble-peak structure for out-of-plane trigger particles. The near-side ridge\n(long range pseudo-rapidity $\\Delta\\eta$ correlation) appears to drop with\nincreasing $\\phi_s$ while the jet-like component remains approximately\nconstant. The correlation functions are further studied with subtraction of odd\nharmonic triangular flow background arising from fluctuations. It is found that\nthe triangular flow, while responsible for the majority of the amplitudes, is\nnot sufficient to explain the $\\phi_s$-dependence of the ridge or the away-side\ndouble-peak structure. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 20:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 19:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 19:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 21:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Typically, it is implemented by adding some sort of norm constraint\nto an objective function and then exactly optimizing the modified objective\nfunction. This procedure often leads to optimization problems that are\ncomputationally more expensive than the original problem, a fact that is\nclearly problematic if one is interested in large-scale applications. On the\nother hand, a large body of empirical work has demonstrated that heuristics,\nand in some cases approximation algorithms, developed to speed up computations\nsometimes have the side-effect of performing regularization implicitly. Thus,\nwe consider the question: What is the regularized optimization objective that\nan approximation algorithm is exactly optimizing?\n  We address this question in the context of computing approximations to the\nsmallest nontrivial eigenvector of a graph Laplacian; and we consider three\nrandom-walk-based procedures: one based on the heat kernel of the graph, one\nbased on computing the the PageRank vector associated with the graph, and one\nbased on a truncated lazy random walk.

The proof makes use of the\ncomplex analytic structure of the character space, together with some recent\nresults on subproduct systems. Restricting attention to commutative operator\nalgebras defined by radical relations yields strong resemblances with classical\nalgebraic geometry. These commutative operator algebras turn out to be algebras\nof analytic functions on algebraic varieties. We prove a projective\nNullstellensatz connecting closed ideals and their zero sets.

It allows us to use the relative strengths\nof stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the\nsource redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of\nthe mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked\nlensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as\nwell as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most\nsignificant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field\nsurveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark\nenergy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model\nsystematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information\nimproves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the\ncluster observables alone. The primordial non-Gaussianity parameter can also be\nconstrained with a level of f_NL~10. In this method, the mean source redshift\nis well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster mass\nin each bin to 5-10% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of the\nself-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 01:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 08:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Besides having to store only few Lanczos vectors, using\nthe BiConjugate Gradient method (BiCG) to solve dual linear systems has\nadvantages for specific applications. For example, using BiCG to solve the dual\nlinear systems arising in interpolatory model reduction provides a backward\nerror formulation in the model reduction framework. Using BiCG to evaluate\nbilinear forms -- for example, in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for\nelectronic structure calculations -- leads to a quadratic error bound. Since\nour focus is on sequences of dual linear systems, we introduce recycling BiCG,\na BiCG method that recycles two Krylov subspaces from one pair of dual linear\nsystems to the next pair. The derivation of recycling BiCG also builds the\nfoundation for developing recycling variants of other bi-Lanczos based methods,\nsuch as CGS, BiCGSTAB, QMR, and TFQMR.\n  We develop an augmented bi-Lanczos algorithm and a modified two-term\nrecurrence to include recycling in the iteration. The recycle spaces are\napproximate left and right invariant subspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues\nclosest to the origin. These recycle spaces are found by solving a small\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem alongside the dual linear systems being solved\nin the sequence.\n  We test our algorithm in two application areas. First, we solve a discretized\npartial differential equation (PDE) of convection-diffusion type. Such a\nproblem provides well-known test cases that are easy to test and analyze\nfurther. Second, we use recycling BiCG in the Iterative Rational Krylov\nAlgorithm (IRKA) for interpolatory model reduction. IRKA requires solving\nsequences of slowly changing dual linear systems. We show up to 70% savings in\niterations, and also demonstrate that for a model reduction problem BiCG takes\n(about) 50% more time than recycling BiCG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 04:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2011 02:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2011 22:52:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2011 04:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The validity of this algorithm is\ndemonstrated through the simulation studies for three extreme cases of two\nfields with unidirectional, opposing and orthogonal geometries.

This paper presents a rigorous logical scheme that provides a\ngeneralized definition of entropy free of the usual unnecessary assumptions\nwhich constrain the theory to the equilibrium domain. The scheme is based on\ncarefully worded operative definitions for all the fundamental concepts\nemployed, including those of system, property, state, isolated system,\nenvironment, process, separable system, system uncorrelated from its\nenvironment, and parameters of a system. The treatment considers also systems\nwith movable internal walls and/or semipermeable walls, with chemical reactions\nand/or external force fields, and with small numbers of particles. The\ndefinition of reversible process is revised by introducing the new concept of\nscenario.

The role of correlations on the domain of definition and on the\nadditivity of energy and entropy is discussed: it is proved that energy is\ndefined and additive for all separable systems, while entropy is defined and\nadditive only for separable systems uncorrelated from their environment;\ndecorrelation entropy is defined.

We conclude the paper with a perturbative check of\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 09:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2011 14:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

We show that the X-ray\nphotoevaporation wind rates scale linearly with X-ray luminosity, such that the\nobserved range of X-ray luminosities for solar-type T-Tauri stars (10e28-10e31\nerg\\s) gives rise to vigorous disc winds with rates of order 10e-10-10e-7\nM_sun/yr. We use the wind solutions from radiation-hydrodynamic models, coupled\nto a viscous evolution model to construct a population synthesis model so that\nwe may study the physical properties of evolving discs and so-called\n`transition discs'. Current observations of disc lifetimes and accretion rates\ncan be matched by our model assuming a viscosity parameter alpha = 2.5e-3. Our\nmodels confirm that X-rays play a dominant role in the evolution and dispersal\nof protoplanetary discs giving rise to the observed diverse population of inner\nhole `transition' sources which include those with massive outer discs, those\nwith gas in their inner holes and those with detectable accretion signatures.\nTo help understand the nature of observed transition discs we present a\ndiagnostic diagram based on accretion rates versus inner hole sizes that\ndemonstrate that, contrary to recent claims, many of the observed accreting and\nnon accreting transition discs can easily be explained by X-ray\nphotoevaporation. Finally, we confirm the conjecture of Drake et al.

The arrival of new information then leads to price\nchanges. The `information-based framework' of Brody, Hughston and Macrina (BHM)\nisolates the emergence of information, and examines its role as a driver of\nprice dynamics. This approach has led to the development of new models that\ncapture a broad range of price behaviour. This thesis extends the work of BHM\nby introducing a wider class of processes for the generation of the market\nfiltration. In the BHM framework, each asset is associated with a collection of\nrandom cash flows. The asset price is the sum of the discounted expectations of\nthe cash flows. Expectations are taken with respect (i) an appropriate measure,\nand (ii) the filtration generated by a set of so-called information processes\nthat carry noisy or imperfect market information about the cash flows. To model\nthe flow of information, we introduce a class of processes termed L\\'evy random\nbridges (LRBs), generalising the Brownian and gamma information processes of\nBHM. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB is identical in law to a L\\'evy\nbridge. We consider in detail the case where the asset generates a single cash\nflow $X_T$ at a fixed date $T$. The flow of information about $X_T$ is modelled\nby an LRB with random terminal value $X_T$. An explicit expression for the\nprice process is found by working out the discounted conditional expectation of\n$X_T$ with respect to the natural filtration of the LRB. New models are\nconstructed using information processes related to the Poisson process, the\nCauchy process, the stable-1/2 subordinator, the variance-gamma process, and\nthe normal inverse-Gaussian process. These are applied to the valuation of\ncredit-risky bonds, vanilla and exotic options, and non-life insurance\nliabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 10:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In recent years, we have detected clear evidence of rotation in more\nthan 5 hot molecular cores (HMCs).

We wish\nto make a thorough study of the structure and kinematics of HMCs and\ncorresponding molecular outflows to reveal possible velocity gradients\nindicative of rotation of the cores. Methods. We carried out PdBI observations\nat 2.7 and 1.4~mm of gas and dust with angular resolutions of 2\"-3\", and 1\"-2\",\nrespectively. To trace both rotation and expansion, we simultaneously observed\nCH3CN, a typical HMC tracer, and 13CO, a typical outflow tracer. Results. The\nCH3CN(12-11) observations have revealed the existence of clear velocity\ngradients in the three HMCs oriented perpendicular to the direction of the\nbipolar outflows. For G19 and G29 the molecular outflows have been mapped in\n13CO. The gradients have been interpreted as rotating toroids. The rotation\ntemperatures, used to derive the mass of the cores, have been obtained by means\nof the rotational diagram method, and lie in the range of 87-244 K. The\ndiameters and masses of the toroids lie in the range of 4550-12600 AU, and\n28-415 Msun, respectively. Given that the dynamical masses are 2 to 30 times\nsmaller than the masses of the cores (if the inclination of the toroids with\nrespect to the plane of the sky is not much smaller than 45 degrees), we\nsuggest that the toroids could be accreting onto the embedded cluster. For G19\nand G29, the collapse is also suggested by the redshifted absorption seen in\nthe 13CO(2-1) line.

One of the main\nresults in this paper shows that if the feasible set of the problem has a\nminimum rank element with the least F-norm (i.e., Frobenius norm), then the\nsolution of the approximation problem converges to the minimum rank solution of\nthe original problem as the approximation parameter tends to zero. The\ntractability under certain conditions and convex relaxation of the\napproximation problem are also discussed. The methodology and results in this\npaper provide a new theoretical basis for the development of some efficient\ncomputational methods for solving rank minimization problems. An immediate\napplication of this theory to the system of quadratic equations is presented in\nthis paper. It turns out that the condition for such a system without a nonzero\nsolution can be characterized by a rank minimization problem, and thus the\nproposed approximation theory can be used to establish some sufficient\nconditions for the system to possess only zero solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 12:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-06"}

These\ncorrelations were derived, tested and used to standardize GRBs, i.e., to derive\ntheir luminosity or radiated energy from one or more observables, in order to\nconstruct an estimated fiducial Hubble diagram, assuming that radiation\npropagates in the standard LambdaCDM cosmological model. We extend these\nanalyses by considering more general models of dark energy, and an updated data\nset of high redshift GRBs. We show that the correlation parameters only weakly\ndepend on the cosmological model. Moreover we apply a local regression\ntechnique to estimate, in a model independent way, the distance modulus from\nthe recently updated SNIa sample containing 307 SNIa (Astier et al. 2006), in\norder to calibrate the GRBs 2D correlations, considering only GRBs with z <1.4.\nThe derived calibration parameters are used to construct a new GRBs Hubble\ndiagram, which we call the calibrated GRBs HD. We also compare the estimated\nand calibrated GRBs HDs. It turns out that for the common GRBs they are fully\nstatistically consistent, thus indicating that both of them are not affected by\nany systematic bias induced by the different standardizing procedures. We\nfinally apply our methods to calibrate 95 long GRBs with the well-known Amati\nrelation and construct the estimated and calibrated GRBs Hubble diagram that\nextends to redshifts z ~ 8. Even in this case there is consistency between\nthese datasets. This means that the high redshift GRBs can be used to test\ndifferent models of dark energy. We used the calibrated GRBs HD to constrain\nour quintessential cosmological model and derived the likelihood values of\nOmega_m and w(0).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 12:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Trailing the \"normal\" profile\npeak there is an \"intermittent\" peak and these components are flanked by two\nadditional components showing very erratic \"RRAT-like\" emission. Both the\nintermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a\nlarge amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch spin-down\nrate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is very\nunusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but is observed in the glitch\nrecovery of a RRAT. The abnormal emission behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 was\nobserved up to three months after the epoch of the large glitch, suggestive of\nchanges in the magnetospheric conditions during the fast part of the recovery\nprocess. We argue that both the anomalous recoveries and the emission changes\ncould be related to reconfigurations of the magnetic field. Apart from the\nglitches, the spin-down of PSR J1119-6127 is relatively stable, allowing us to\nrefine the measurement of the braking index (n=2.684\\pm0.002) using more than\n12 years of timing data. The properties of this pulsar are discussed in light\nof the growing evidence that RRATs do not form a distinct class of pulsar, but\nrather are a combination of different extreme emission types seen in other\nneutron stars. Different sub-classes of the RRATs can potentially be separated\nby calculating the lower limit on the modulation index of their emission. We\nspeculate that if the abnormal behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 is indeed glitch\ninduced then there might exist a population of neutron stars which only become\nvisible in the radio band for a short duration in the immediate aftermath of\nglitch activity.

Dense amorphous packings of granular media and foams also\nexhibit slow dynamics, intermittency and heterogeneities. We review a number of\nrecent experimental studies of these systems, where one has direct access to\nthe relevant space-time dynamics, allowing for direct visualisations of the\ndynamical heterogeneities. On one hand these visualisations provide a unique\nopportunity to access the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the growth of\ndynamical correlations. On the other hand focussing on the differences in these\nheterogeneities in microscopically different systems allows to discuss the\nrange of the analogies between molecular thermal glasses and athermal glasses\nsuch as granular media and foams. Finally this review is the opportunity to\ndiscuss various approaches to actually extract quantitatively the dynamical\nlengthscale from experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 13:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In contrast, leptons of other flavors are non-degenerate and\ntherefore relatively scarce. This is due to lepton flavor conservation. If this\nconservation law is broken by some non-standard interactions, electron\nneutrinos are converted to muon and tau-neutrinos, and electrons -- to muons.\nThis affects the supernova dynamics and the supernova neutrino signal in\nseveral ways. In particular, the total neutrino luminosity in the first second\nof the collapse is increased due to the larger free path of the non-electron\nneutrinos. This effect may have important consequences as the increase of the\nneutrino luminosity is known to facilitate the explosion. We consider an\nextension of the Standard Model by scalar bileptons which mediate lepton flavor\nviolation. It is shown that in case of TeV-mass bileptons the electron fermi\ngas is equilibrated with non-electron species inside the inner supernova core\nat a time-scale of order of (1-100) ms. In particular, a scalar triplet which\ngenerates neutrino masses through the see-saw type II mechanism is considered.\nNon-observation of rare decays and data on neutrino mixing and neutrino masses\nrestrict possible lepton flavor violation effects in this case. However a\nregion in the parameter space of the model exists which fits all the\nexperimental constraints and provides lepton flavor violation sufficient for\nobservable effects in supernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 13:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-06"}

Our analysis is based on locating a particular\nbifurcation of the solutions of the integral equation for the inhomogeneous\nsingle particle density at the transition between different spatial structures.\nThe bifurcation of solutions we study is initiated from the dense metastable\nfluid, and we associate it with the limit of stability of the fluid, which we\nidentify with the transition from the metastable fluid to a maximally random\njammed state.

The sudden change of pressure in this region\nleads to the development of a viscous and thermal instability, and the neutrino\npressure acts similarly to the radiation pressure in sub-Eddington disks.

By considering the classification\nof positive Einstein curvature tensors and the classical Cauchy-Choquet-Bruhat\ntheorems in general relativity, we introduce concepts of types and rigidity.\nThen, abandoning the usual requirement of a Ricci-flat five dimensional\nspace-time, we show that a unified geometrical frame can be set for gravitation\nand electromagnetism, giving, by projection on the classical 4-dimensional\nspace-time, the known Einstein-Maxwell-Lorentz equations for charged fluids.\nThus, although not introducing, at least at this stage, new physics, we get a\nvery aesthetic presentation of classical physics in the spirit of general\nrelativity. The usual physical concepts, such as mass, energy, charge,\ntrajectory, Maxwell-Lorentz law, are shown to be only various aspects of the\ngeometry, for example curvature, of space-time considered as a Lorentzian\nmanifold; that is no physical objects are introduced in space-time, no laws are\ngiven, everything is only geometry. We will then extend this setting to more\nthan 5 dimensions, giving a precise mathematical frame for possible additional\nphysical effects, preserving gravitation and electromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 14:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2010 18:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 10:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 14:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 15:21:51 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 16:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}
