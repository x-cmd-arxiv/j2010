We discuss the\nimplications of this population as it pertains to several cosmological and\nastrophysical observables. For example, some very metal-poor galactic stars\nshow large enhancements of carbon, typical of the C-rich ejecta of low-mass\nstars but not of supernovae; moreover, halo star carbon and oxygen abundances\nshow wide scatter, which imply a wide range of star-formation and\nnucleosynthetic histories contributed to the first generations of stars. Also,\nrecent analyses of the 4He abundance in metal-poor extragalactic H II regions\nsuggest an elevated abundance Yp \\simeq 0.256 by mass, higher than the\npredicted result from big bang nucleosynthesis assuming the baryon density\ndetermined by WMAP, Yp = 0.249. Although there are large uncertainties in the\nobservational determination of 4He, this offset may suggest a prompt initial\nenrichment of 4He in early metal-poor structures. We also discuss the effect of\nintermediate mass stars on global cosmic evolution, the reionization of the\nUniverse, the density of white dwarfs, as well as SNII and SNIa rates at high\nredshift. We also comment on the early astration of D and 7Li. We conclude that\nif intermediate mass stars are to be associated with Population III stars,\ntheir relevance is limited (primarily from observed abundance patterns) to low\nmass structures involving a limited fraction of the total baryon content of the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 16:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A recent approach that has drawn considerable attention is sparse\nrepresentation modeling, in which the signal is assumed to be generated as a\ncombination of a few atoms from a given dictionary. In this work we consider a\nBayesian setting and go beyond the classic assumption of independence between\nthe atoms. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a statistical model that\ntakes such dependencies into account and show how this model can be used for\nsparse signal recovery. We follow the suggestion of two recent works and assume\nthat the sparsity pattern is modeled by a Boltzmann machine, a commonly used\ngraphical model. For general dependency models, exact MAP and MMSE estimation\nof the sparse representation becomes computationally complex. To simplify the\ncomputations, we propose greedy approximations of the MAP and MMSE estimators.\nWe then consider a special case in which exact MAP is feasible, by assuming\nthat the dictionary is unitary and the dependency model corresponds to a\ncertain sparse graph. Exploiting this structure, we develop an efficient\nmessage passing algorithm that recovers the underlying signal. When the model\nparameters defining the underlying graph are unknown, we suggest an algorithm\nthat learns these parameters directly from the data, leading to an iterative\nscheme for adaptive sparse signal recovery. The effectiveness of our approach\nis demonstrated on real-life signals - patches of natural images - where we\ncompare the denoising performance to that of previous recovery methods that do\nnot exploit the statistical dependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 16:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 08:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 12:40:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 08:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

While punishment is traditionally considered more successful than\nreward, the fact that the cost of punishment frequently fails to offset gains\nfrom enhanced cooperation has lead some to reconsider reward as the main\ncatalyst behind collaborative efforts. Here we elaborate on the \"stick versus\ncarrot\" dilemma by studying the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public\ngoods game, where besides the traditional cooperators and defectors, rewarding\ncooperators supplement the array of possible strategies. The latter are willing\nto reward cooperative actions at a personal cost, thus effectively downgrading\npure cooperators to second-order free-riders due to their unwillingness to bear\nthese additional costs. Consequently, we find that defection remains viable,\nespecially if the rewarding is costly. Rewards, however, can promote\ncooperation, especially if the synergetic effects of cooperation are low.\nSurprisingly, moderate rewards may promote cooperation better than high\nrewards, which is due to the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance between\nthe three strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 19:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

The GCs NGC 2419, located at 90 kpc from the center of our Galaxy, and\nMGC1, located at ~200 kpc from the center of M31, are ideal laboratories for\ntesting the scenario that GCs formed at the centers of massive dark halos.\nComparing analytic models to observations of these GCs, we conclude that these\nGCs cannot be embedded within dark halos with a virial mass greater than 10^6\nMsun, or, equivalently, the dark matter halo mass-to-stellar mass ratio must be\nMdm/M_*<1. If these GCs have indeed orbited within weak tidal fields throughout\ntheir lifetimes, then these limits imply that these GCs did not form within\ntheir own dark halos.

However, the observed inner radius of the torus is\nsystematically smaller than the expected radius by a factor of ~ 1/3. We show\nthat the anisotropy of the emission from accretion disks resolves this conflict\nnaturally and quantitatively. An accretion disk emits lesser radiation in the\ndirection closer to its equatorial plane (i.e., to the torus). We find that the\nanisotropy makes the torus inner region closer to the central black hole and\nconcave. Moreover, the innermost edge of the torus may connect with the\noutermost edge of the disk continuously. Considering the anisotropic emission\nof each clump in the torus, we calculate the near-infrared flux variation in\nresponse to a UV flash. For an observer at the polar angle theta_obs = 25 deg,\nthe centroid of the time delay is found to be 37% of the delay expected in the\ncase of isotropic illumination, which explains the observed systematic\ndeviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 20:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Uncertainties about the proper value of this ratio can be\nsidestepped by including radiative transfer. Three-dimensional radiative\nhydrodynamics models of a disk with a mass of $0.043 M_\\odot$ from 4 to 20 AU\nin orbit around a $1 M_\\odot$ protostar show that disk instabilities are\nconsiderably less successful in producing self-gravitating clumps than in a\ndisk with twice this mass.

The purpose of the article\nis twofold. First, it is written in a colloquial style and is intended to be a\npedagogical introduction to the gauge approach to gravity. I begin with a\nreview of the Einstein-Cartan formulation of gravity, move on to the\nMacdowell-Mansouri approach, then show how gravity can be viewed as the\nsymmetry broken phase of an (A)dS-gauge theory. This covers roughly the first\nhalf of the article. Armed with these tools, the remainder of the article is\ngeared toward new insights and new lines of research that can be gained by\nviewing gravity from this perspective. Drawing from familiar concepts from the\nsymmetry broken gauge theories of the standard model, we show how the\ntopological structure of the gauge group allows for an infinite class of new\nsolutions to the Einstein-Cartan field equations that can be thought of as\ndegenerate ground states of the theory. We argue that quantum mechanical\ntunneling allows for transitions between the degenerate vacua. Generalizing the\ntunneling process from a topological phase of the gauge theory to an arbitrary\ngeometry leads to a modern reformulation of the Hartle-Hawking \"no boundary\"\nproposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 22:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}

The lifetime of sunlight-reflecting microbubbles, and hence the\nscale on which they may be applied, depends on Stokes Law and the influence of\nambient or added surfactants. Small bubbles backscatter light more efficiently\nthan large ones, opening the possibility of using highly dilute micron-radius\nhydrosols to substantially brighten surface waters. Such microbubbles can\nnoticeably increase water surface reflectivity, even at volume fractions of\nparts per million and such loadings can be created at an energy cost as low as\nJ m-2 to initiate and milliwatts m-2 to sustain. Increasing water albedo in\nthis way can reduce solar energy absorption by as much as 100 W m-2,\npotentially reducing equilibrium temperatures of standing water bodies by\nseveral Kelvins. While aerosols injected into the stratosphere tend to alter\nclimate globally, hydrosols can be used to modulate surface albedo, locally and\nreversibly, without risk of degrading the ozone layer or altering the color of\nthe sky. The low energy cost of microbubbles suggests a new approach to solar\nradiation management in water conservation and geoengineering: Don't dim the\nSun; Brighten the water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 23:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}

Even though I find the\narguments justifying such a claim in this latest proposal rather ad hoc and\nsimplistic compared to the original one I would unreservedly support the call\nto explore deeper the relation between gravity and thermodynamics, this having\nthe same spirit as my long-held view that general relativity is the\nhydrodynamic limit [5, 6] of some underlying theories for the microscopic\nstructure of spacetime - all these proposals, together with that of [7, 8],\nattest to the emergent nature of gravity [9]. In this first paper of two we set\nthe modest goal of studying the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of classical\nmatter only, bringing afore some interesting prior results, without invoking\nany quantum considerations such as Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, holography or\nUnruh effect. This is for the sake of understanding the nonequilibrium nature\nof classical gravity which is at the root of many salient features of black\nhole physics. One important property of gravitational systems, from\nself-gravitating gas to black holes, is their negative heat capacity, which is\nthe source of many out-of-the ordinary dynamical and thermodynamic features\nsuch as the non-existence in isolated systems of thermodynamically stable\nconfigurations, which actually provides the condition for gravitational\nstability.

Liquid-gas phase transition is found to suppress the cluster\nyield within the coexistence phase as well as decrease considerably the\nneutron-proton asymmetry over a wide density range. We find symmetry energy has\na modest effect on the boundaries and the critical temperature for the\nliquid-gas phase transition, and the composition depends more sensitively on\nthe number of trapped neutrinos and temperature of the protoneutron star. The\ninfluence of hyperons in the dense interior of stars makes the overall equation\nof state soft.

Recently, Gilfanov & Bogdan (2010, hereafter GB10)\nclaimed that observed X-ray fluxes of early type galaxies would be too low to\nbe consistent with the prediction of the SD scenario based on rather simple\nassumptions. We present realistic evolutionary models of SD systems and\ncalculate durations of SSS phases. In most cases, accreting WDs spend a large\nfraction of time in the optically thick wind phase and the recurrent nova phase\nrather than the SSS phase. Thus the SSS phase lasts only for a few hundred\nthousand years. This is by a factor of ~10 shorter than those adopted by GB10\nwhere the SN~Ia progenitor WD was assumed to spend most of its life as a SSS.\nThe theoretical X-ray luminosity of the SSS has a large uncertainty because of\nthe uncertain atmospheric model of mass-accreting WDs and absorption of soft\nX-rays by the companion star's cool wind material. We thus adopt an average of\nthe observed fluxes of existing symbiotic SSSs, i.e., ~0.4 x 10^{36} erg s^{-1}\nfor 0.3--0.7 keV. Using these SSS duration and soft X-ray luminosity, we show\nthat the observed X-ray flux obtained by GB10 is rather consistent with our\nestimated flux in early type galaxies based on the SD scenario.

The effect is asymmetric with respect to the tilting angle.\nThe unlocking is accompanied by switching of the systems from the d.c. to the\na.c. Josephson state.

The LWDA was a 16-dipole phased array telescope,\nlocated on the site of the Very Large Array in New Mexico. The field of view of\nthe individual dipoles was essentially the entire sky, and the number of\ndipoles was sufficiently small that a simple software correlator could be used\nto make all-sky images. From 2006 October to 2007 February, we conducted an\nall-sky transient search program, acquiring a total of 106 hr of data; the time\nsampling varied, being 5 minutes at the start of the program and improving to 2\nminutes by the end of the program. We were able to detect solar flares, and in\na special-purpose mode, radio reflections from ionized meteor trails during the\n2006 Leonid meteor shower. We detected no transients originating outside of the\nsolar system above a flux density limit of 500 Jy, equivalent to a limit of no\nmore than about 10^{-2} events/yr/deg^2, having a pulse energy density >~ 1.5 x\n10^{-20} J/m^2/Hz at 73.8 MHz for pulse widths of about 300 s.

We find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass\nto flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. First, the field offers\nlocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,\nsubstantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to\nthe gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the\ncollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for\naccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final\nmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound\nup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never\nachieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two\nreasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central\nregions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to\nfurther disrupt the field geometry. Therefore, outflows driven by ionization\nheating look likely to be more dynamically important in regions of massive star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 09:27:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 17:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

In general,\nthis is at odds with the distribution of CN band strengths among first ascent\nred giant branch (RGB) stars. Norris et al. proposed that the lack of CN-strong\nstars in some clusters is a consequence of a smaller mass of these stars that\ncannot evolve through the full AGB phase. In this short paper we found that the\nrelative frequency of AGB stars can change by a factor of two between different\nclusters. We also find a very good correlation between the minimum mass of\nstars along the horizontal branch (Gratton et al. 2010) and the relative\nfrequency of AGB stars, with a further dependence on metallicity. We conclude\nthat indeed the stars with the smallest mass on the HB cannot evolve through\nthe full AGB phase, being AGB-manque'. These stars likely had large He and N\ncontent, and large O-depletion. We then argue that there should not be AGB\nstars with extreme O depletion, and few of them with a moderate one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 10:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

A\nvariety of theoretical probes are used to determine the quantum phase\ntransition, including energy gap crossing, a finite size scaling analysis, and\nbipartite quantum entanglement.

Rigid and differential rotation can\nbe distinguished for more than 50 rapid rotators (vsini > 12 km/s) among the\nsample stars from the available spectra. Ten stars with significant\ndifferential rotation rates of 10-54 % are identified, which add to the few\nknown rapid differential rotators. Differential rotation measurements of 6 %\nand less for four of our targets are probably spurious and below the detection\nlimit. Including these objects, the line shapes of more than 40 stars are\nconsistent with rigid rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 12:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}

Orbital motion in the lens is one such effect, which if detected, can\nbe used to constrain the physical properties of the lens. To determine the\nfraction of binary lens lightcurves affected by orbital motion (the detection\nefficiency) we simulate lightcurves of orbiting binary star and star-planet\n(planetary) lenses and simulate the continuous, high-cadence photometric\nmonitoring that will be conducted by the next generation of microlensing\nsurveys that are beginning to enter operation. The effect of orbital motion is\nmeasured by fitting simulated lightcurve data with standard static binary\nmicrolensing models; lightcurves that are poorly fit by these models are\nconsidered to be detections of orbital motion. We correct for systematic false\npositive detections by also fitting the lightcurves of static binary lenses.\nFor a continuous monitoring survey without intensive follow-up of high\nmagnification events, we find the orbital motion detection efficiency for\nplanetary events with caustic crossings to be 0.061+-0.010, consistent with\nobservational results, and 0.0130+-0.0055 for events without caustic crossings\n(smooth events).

We demonstrate that the mean-field repulsive nonlinearity\nprevents the collapse and thus puts forward a solution to the quantum-anomaly\nproblem different from that previously developed in the framework of the linear\nquantum-field theory. This solution may be realized in the 3D or 2D gas of\ndipolar bosons attracted by a central charge, and in the 2D gas of magnetic\ndipoles attracted by a current filament. In the 3D setting, the dipole-dipole\ninteractions are also taken into regard, in the mean-field approximation. In\nlieu of the collapse, the cubic nonlinearity creates a 3D ground state (GS),\nwhich does not exist in the respective linear Schroedinger equation (SE). The\naddition of the harmonic trap gives rise to a tristability, in the case when\nthe SE still does not lead to the collapse. In the 2D setting, the cubic\nnonlinearity is not strong enough to prevent the collapse; however, the quintic\nterm does it, creating the GS, as well as its counterparts carrying the angular\nmomentum (vorticity). Counter-intuitively, such self-trapped 2D modes exist\neven in the case of a weakly repulsive potential 1/r^2. In the presence of the\nharmonic trap, the 2D quintic model with a weakly repulsive central potential\n1/r^2 gives rise to three confined modes, the middle one being unstable,\nspontaneously developing into a breather. In both the 3D and 2D cases, the GS\nwave functions are found in a numerical form, and also in the form of an\nanalytical approximation, which is asymptotically exact in the limit of the\nlarge norm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 13:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The ILC will complement the\nLarge Hadron Collider, a proton-proton accelerator, and provide precision\nmeasurements, which may help in solving some of the fundamental questions at\nthe frontier of scientific research, such as the origin of mass and the\npossible existence of new principles of nature.\n  The linear collider community has set a goal to achieve a precision of\n$10^{-4}$ on the luminosity measurement at the ILC. This may be accomplished by\nconstructing a finely granulated calorimeter, which will measure Bhabha\nscattering at small angles. The Bhabha cross-section is theoretically known to\ngreat precision, yet the rate of Bhabha scattering events, which would be\nmeasured by the luminosity detector, will be influenced by beam-beam effects,\nand by the inherent energy spread of the collider. The electroweak radiative\neffects can be calculated to high precision and partially checked with events\nwith final state photon radiation by distinguishing between the observable\nenergy deposits of electrons and of photons in the luminosity calorimeter,\nusing a clustering algorithm.\n  In order to achieve the design goal, the geometrical parameters of the\ncalorimeter need to be reevaluated. This must be done in a generalized manner,\nso as to facilitate future modifications, the need for which is foreseen, due\nto expected changes in the detector concept.\n  This work demonstrates that the clustering approach is viable, and that a\nluminosity calorimeter may be designed to match the precision requirements on\nthe luminosity measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 15:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-29"}
