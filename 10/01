The galaxies under\nconsideration have a typical absolute magnitude of -18 (B-band), and at the\nKormendy's relation they settle within a transition zone between the main cloud\nof giant ellipticals and the sequence of diffuse ellipticals. By measuring Lick\nindices and investigating radial profiles of the SSP-equivalent ages and\nmetallicities of the stellar populations in their central parts, I have found\nevolutionary distinct cores in all of them. Typically, the ages of these cores\nare 2-4 Gyr, and the metallicities are higher than the solar one. Outside the\ncores, the stellar populations are always old, T>12 Gyr, and the metallicities\nare subsolar. This finding implies that the well-known correlation between the\nstellar age and the total mass (luminosity) of field ellipticals (Trager et al.\n2000, Caldwell et al. 2003, Howell 2005) may be in fact a direct consequence of\na larger contribution of nuclear starbursts into the integrated stellar\npopulation in dwarfs with respect to giants, and does not relate to\n`downsizing'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 16:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The existence of partly cloudy regions has been supported\nby evidence for variability in dwarfs in the late L to early T spectral range,\nbut no self-consistent atmosphere models of such partly cloudy objects have yet\nbeen constructed. Here we present a new approach for consistently modeling\npartly cloudy brown dwarfs and giant planets. We find that even a small\nfraction of cloud holes dramatically alter the atmospheric thermal profile,\nspectra, and photometric colors of a given object. With decreasing cloudiness\nobjects briskly become bluer in J - K and brighten in J band, as is observed at\nthe L/T transition. Model spectra of partly cloudy objects are similar to our\nmodels with globally homogenous, but thinner, clouds. Hence spectra alone may\nnot be sufficient to distinguish partial cloudiness although variability and\npolarization measurements are potential observational signatures. Finally we\nnote that partial cloud cover may be an alternative explanation for the blue L\ndwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 18:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Large scale radial and toroidal fields are also generated\nnear the mid-plane and subsequently rise through the disk.

It is shown that essentially all\nfeatures of the Landau-Zener problem including the depletion of the condensate\nmode can be already understood within a semiclassical phase space picture. In\nparticular, this treatment resolves the formerly imputed incommutability of the\nadiabatic and semiclassical limits.

In this paper, we propose a continuous-time control scheme that\nmodifies the structure of a position-dependent network of mobile robots so that\nit achieves a desired set of adjacency eigenvalues. For this, we employ a novel\nabstraction of the eigenvalue spectrum by means of the adjacency matrix\nspectral moments. Since the eigenvalue spectrum is uniquely determined by its\nspectral moments, this abstraction provides a way to indirectly control the\neigenvalues of the network. Our construction is based on artificial potentials\nthat capture the distance of the network's spectral moments to their desired\nvalues. Minimization of these potentials is via a gradient descent closed-loop\nsystem that, under certain convexity assumptions, ensures convergence of the\nnetwork topology to one with the desired set of moments and, therefore,\neigenvalues. We illustrate our approach in nontrivial computer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2010 23:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-04"}

The number of sensing stages and the sensing technique per\nstage can be used to optimize performance with respect to secondary user\nthroughput and the collision probability between primary and secondary users.\nSo far, the impact of multi-stage sensing on network throughput and collision\nprobability for a realistic network model is relatively unexplored. Therefore,\nwe present the first analytical framework which enables performance evaluation\nof different multi-channel multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms for\nOpportunistic Spectrum Access networks. The contribution of our work lies in\nstudying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of\nsensing stages, physical layer sensing techniques and durations per each stage,\nsingle and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels,\nprimary and secondary user traffic, buffering of incoming secondary user\ntraffic, as well as MAC layer sensing algorithms. Analyzed performance metrics\ninclude the average secondary user throughput and the average collision\nprobability between primary and secondary users. Our results show that when the\nprobability of primary user mis-detection is constrained, the performance of\nmulti-stage sensing is, in most cases, superior to the single stage sensing\ncounterpart. Besides, prolonged channel observation at the first stage of\nsensing decreases the collision probability considerably, while keeping the\nthroughput at an acceptable level. Finally, in realistic primary user traffic\nscenarios, using two stages of sensing provides a good balance between\nsecondary users throughput and collision probability while meeting successful\ndetection constraints subjected by Opportunistic Spectrum Access communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 00:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2010 20:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2011 23:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

At each instance of time, a (secondary) user probes a channel and\ncollects a certain reward as a function of the state of the channel (e.g., good\nchannel condition results in higher data rate for the user). Each channel has\npotentially different state space and statistics, both unknown to the user, who\ntries to learn which one is the best as it goes and maximizes its usage of the\nbest channel. The objective is to construct a good online learning algorithm so\nas to minimize the difference between the user's performance in total rewards\nand that of using the best channel (on average) had it known which one is the\nbest from a priori knowledge of the channel statistics (also known as the\nregret). This is a classic exploration and exploitation problem and results\nabound when the reward processes are assumed to be iid. Compared to prior work,\nthe biggest difference is that in our case the reward process is assumed to be\nMarkovian, of which iid is a special case. In addition, the reward processes\nare restless in that the channel conditions will continue to evolve independent\nof the user's actions. This leads to a restless bandit problem, for which there\nexists little result on either algorithms or performance bounds in this\nlearning context to the best of our knowledge.

The diffusion\nof cosmic-rays through these magnetically turbulent environments is often\nstudied through the use of energy-dependent diffusion coefficients, although\nthese are not always well motivated theoretically. Now, however, it is feasible\nto perform detailed numerical simulations of the diffusion process\ncomputationally. While the general problem depends upon both the field\nstructure and particle energy, the analysis may be greatly simplified by\ndimensionless analysis. That is, for a specified purely turbulent field, the\nanalysis depends almost exclusively on a single parameter -- the ratio of the\nmaximum wavelength of the turbulent field cells to the particle gyration\nradius. For turbulent magnetic fluctuations superimposed over an underlying\nuniform magnetic field, particle diffusion depends on a second dimensionless\nparameter that characterizes the ratio of the turbulent to uniform magnetic\nfield energy densities. We consider both of these possibilities and parametrize\nour results to provide simple quantitative expressions that suitably\ncharacterize the diffusion process within molecular cloud environments. Doing\nso, we find that the simple scaling laws often invoked by the high-energy\nastrophysics community to model cosmic-ray diffusion through such regions\nappear to be fairly robust for the case of a uniform magnetic field with a\nstrong turbulent component, but are only valid up to $\\sim 50$ TeV particle\nenergies for a purely turbulent field.

This\nmap takes values in the intermediate Jacobian of the compactly supported\ncohomology of the stable locus. We show that this is an isomorphism and since\nthe intermediate Jacobian is identified with the Jacobian $Jac(C)\\otimes \\Q$,\nthis can be thought of as a weak-representability result for open smooth\nvarieties. A Hard Lefschetz theorem is also proved for the odd degree bottom\nweight cohomology of the moduli space $\\cSU_C^s(2,\\cO_C)$. When the rank $r\\geq\n2$, we compute the codimension two rational Chow groups of $\\cSU_C(r,\\cO_C)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 08:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-04"}

We\nintroduce a model selection approach to GWAS based on modifications of Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC) and develop some simple search strategies to deal\nwith the huge number of potential models. Comprehensive simulations based on\nreal SNP data confirm that model selection has larger power than multiple\ntesting to detect causal SNPs in complex models. On the other hand multiple\ntesting has substantial problems with proper ranking of causal SNPs and tends\nto detect a certain number of false positive SNPs, which are not linked to any\nof the causal mutations. We show that this behavior is typical in GWAS for\ncomplex traits and can be explained by an aggregated influence of many small\nrandom sample correlations between genotypes of a SNP under investigation and\nother causal SNPs. We believe that our findings at least partially explain\nproblems with low power and nonreplicability of results in many real data GWAS.\nFinally, we discuss the advantages of our model selection approach in the\ncontext of real data analysis, where we consider publicly available gene\nexpression data as traits for individuals from the HapMap project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 11:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-04"}

To explain the prominent absorption features in the soft\nX-ray spectra of the highly magnetized (B ~ 10^{14} G) X-ray dim isolated NSs\n(XDINSs), we theoretically investigate different NS local surface models,\nincluding naked condensed iron surfaces and partially ionized hydrogen model\natmospheres, with semi-infinite and thin atmospheres above the condensed\nsurface.

As\na consequence one obtains a generalization of the following theorem of Youngs:\nIf a quadrangulation of the projective plane is not bipartite it has chromatic\nnumber four. The generalization states that in this case the local chromatic\nnumber is also four. Both papers [1] and [13] generalize Youngs's result to\narbitrary non-orientable surfaces replacing the condition of the graph being\nnot bipartite by a more technical condition of an odd quadrangulation. This\npaper investigates when these general results are true for the local chromatic\nnumber instead of the chromatic number. Surprisingly, we find out that (unlike\nin the case of the chromatic number) this depends on the genus of the surface.\nFor the non-orientable surfaces of genus at most four, the local chromatic\nnumber of any odd quadrangulation is at least four, but this is not true for\nnon-orientable surfaces of genus 5 or higher.

If the\nagents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required\nto move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning\ncycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and\ncan be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a\nmulti-agent environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 13:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-04"}

Owing to this feature, we find that in the next two years the extra\nZ_{1,2}-bosons could be discovered in the favoured Drell-Yan channel at the 7\nTeV LHC for Z_{1,2} masses in the TeV region, depending on model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 14:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-25"}

It has been found that dark energy dominates the\nuniverse at the present epoch, which is consistent with the observations. The\nphysical behavior of the universe is discussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 03:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}

The energy-momentum\ntensor, as formulated by Letelier (1983), has been used to construct a massive\nstring cosmological model for which the expansion scalar is proportional to one\nof the components of shear tensor. The Einstein's field equations have been\nsolved by applying a variation law for generalized Hubble's parameter that\nyields a constant value of deceleration parameter in Bianchi-II space-time. A\ncomparative study of accelerating and decelerating modes of the evolution of\nuniverse has been carried out in the presence of string scenario. The study\nreveals that massive strings dominate the early Universe. The strings\neventually disappear from the Universe for sufficiently large times, which is\nin agreement with the current astronomical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 04:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 11:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 14:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-27"}
