First, we consider the\nmeasure-and-prepare channel that uses optimal estimation to convert M copies\ninto k approximate copies of an unknown pure state and we show that this\nchannel is equal to a random loss of all but s particles followed by cloning\nfrom s to k copies. When the number k of output copies is large with respect to\nthe number M of input copies the measure-and-prepare channel converges in\ndiamond norm to the optimal universal cloning. In the opposite case, when M is\nlarge compared to k, the estimation becomes almost perfect and the\nmeasure-and-prepare channel converges in diamond norm to the partial trace over\nall but k systems. This result is then used to derive de Finetti-type results\nfor quantum states and for symmetric broadcast channels, that is, channels that\ndistribute quantum information to many receivers in a permutationally invariant\nfashion. Applications of the finite de Finetti theorem for symmetric broadcast\nchannels include the derivation of diamond-norm bounds on the asymptotic\nconvergence of quantum cloning to state estimation and the derivation of bounds\non the amount of quantum information that can be jointly decoded by a group of\nk receivers at the output of a symmetric broadcast channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2010 21:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 16:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 06:16:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2010 23:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-16"}

To obtain the\napproximation bounds, we introduce a new technique that while conceptually\nsimple, seems to be quite powerful. With this method we are able to prove the\nfollowing results.\n  First, we consider Smith's Rule, which orders the jobs on a machine in\nascending processing time to weight ratio, and show that it achieves an\napproximation ratio of 4. We also demonstrate that this is the best possible\nfor deterministic non-preemptive strongly local policies. Since Smith's Rule is\nalways optimal for a given assignment, this may seem unsurprising, but we then\nshow that better approximation ratios can be obtained if either preemption or\nrandomization is allowed.\n  We prove that ProportionalSharing, a preemptive strongly local policy,\nachieves an approximation ratio of 2.618 for the weighted sum of completion\ntimes, and an approximation ratio of 2.5 in the unweighted case. Again, we\nobserve that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural\nnon-preemptive but randomized policy. We show that it achieves an approximation\nratio of at most 2.13; moreover, if the sum of the weighted completion times is\nnegligible compared to the cost of the optimal solution, this improves to \\pi\n/2.\n  Finally, we show that both ProportionalSharing and Rand induce potential\ngames, and thus always have a pure Nash equilibrium (unlike Smith's Rule).

In the focus of this paper\nlies a simplicial complex K_P which carries complete information about the\ncombinatorial type of P. In the case when P is simple, K_P is the same as dP*,\nwhere P* is a polar dual polytope. Using the canonical embedding of a polytope\nP into nonnegative orthant, we introduce a moment-angle space Z_P for a\npolytope P. It is known, that in the case when P is simple the space Z_P is\nhomeomorphic to the polyhedral product (D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. When P is not simple,\nwe prove that the space Z_P is homotopically equivalent to the space\n(D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. This allows to introduce bigraded Betti numbers for any convex\npolytope. A Stanley-Reisner ring of a polytope P can be defined as a\nStanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex K_P. All these considerations lead\nto a natural question: which simplicial complexes arise as K_P for some\npolytope P? We have proceeded in this direction by introducing a notion of a\npolytopic simplicial complex. It has the following property: link of each\nsimplex in a polytopic complex is either contractible, or retractible to a\nsubcomplex, homeomorphic to a sphere. The complex K_P is a polytopic simplicial\ncomplex for any polytope P. Links of so called face simplices in a polytopic\ncomplex are polytopic complexes as well. This fact is sufficient enough to\nconnect face polynomial of a simplicial complex K_P to the face polynomial of a\npolytope P, giving a series of inequalities on certain combinatorial\ncharacteristics of P. Two of these inequalities are equalities for each P and\nrepresent Euler-Poincare formula and one of Bayer-Billera relations for flag\nf-numbers. In the case when P is simple all inequalities turn out to be\nclassical Dehn-Sommerville relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 14:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2010 16:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2010 19:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}

In the fact, the idea is untested\nhypothesis. After ten years of intense research, our experiments showed that\natoms can be divided into three categories: polar, non-polar and hydrogen atom.\nAlkali atoms are all polar atoms. The EDM of a Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium and\nCesium atom in the ground state have been obtained as follows: d(Na)=1.28*10\nto-8 power e.cm; d(K)=1.58*10 to-8 power e.cm; d(Rb)=1.70 *10 to-8 power e.cm;\nd(Cs)=1.86*10 to-8 power e.cm. All kind of atoms are non-polar atoms except for\nalkali and hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atom is quite distinct from the others. The\nground state in hydrogen is non-polar atom(d=0) but the excited state is polar\natom, for example, the first excited state has a large EDM: d(H)=3ea=1.59*10\nto-8 power e.cm (a is Bohr radius).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2010 12:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-13"}
