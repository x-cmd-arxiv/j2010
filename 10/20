Seven\nluminous sources were studied individually, four in globular clusters (GCs),\nand three in the stellar field. The range of (0.3-8 keV) $L_X$ for these\nsources suggests that they may be black hole binaries (BHBs). Comparison of our\nresults with simulations allows us to discriminate between disk and power-law\ndominated emission, pointing to spectral/luminosity variability, reminiscent of\nGalactic BHBs. The BH masses derived from a comparison of our spectral results\nwith the $L_X \\sim T^4_{in}$ relation of Galactic BHBs are in the 5-15\n$M_{\\odot}$ range, as observed in the Milky Way.\n  The analysis of joint spectra of sources selected in three luminosity ranges\nsuggests that while the high luminosity sources have prominent thermal disk\nemission components, power-law components are likely to be important in the mid\nand low-luminosity spectra. Comparing low-luminosity average spectra, we find a\nrelatively larger $N_H$ in the GC spectrum; we speculate that this may point to\neither a metallicity effect, or to intrinsic physical differences between field\nand GC accreting binaries.\n  Analysis of average sample properties uncover a previously unreported $L_X -\nR_G$ correlation (where $R_G$ is the galactocentric radius) in the GC-LMXB\nsample, implying richer LMXB populations in more central GCs. No such trend is\nseen in the field LMXB sample. We can exclude that the GC $L_X - R_G$\ncorrelation is the by-product of a luminosity effect, and suggest that it may\nbe related to the presence of more compact GCs at smaller galactocentric radii,\nfostering more efficient binary formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 16:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Aims: Our aim is to\nimage the HDO emission in the protostar surroundings, the possible occurrence\nof HDO emission also investigating off L1448-mm, towards the molecular outflow.\nMethods: We carried out observations of L1448-mm in the HDO(1_10-1_11) line at\n80.6 GHz, an excellent tracer of HDO column density, with the IRAM Plateau de\nBure Interferometer. Results: We image for the first time HDO emission around\nL1448-mm. The HDO structure reveals a main clump at velocities close to the\nambient one towards the the continuum peak that is caused by the dust heated by\nthe protostar. In addition, the HDO map shows tentative weaker emission at\nabout 2000 AU from the protostar towards the south, which is possibly\nassociated with the walls of the outflow cavity opened by the protostellar\nwind. Conclusions: Using an LVG code, modelling the density and temperature\nprofile of the hot-corino, and adopting a gas temperature of 100 K and a\ndensity of 1.5 10^8 cm^-3, we derive a beam diluted HDO column density of about\n7 10^13 cm^-2, corresponding to a HDO abundance of about 4 10^-7.

These MHD simulations\nare used to study ultra low frequency (ULF) pulsations in the Earth's\nmagnetosphere driven by shear instabilities at the flanks of the magnetopause.\nWe drive the simulations with idealized, constant solar wind input parameters,\nensuring that any discrete ULF pulsations generated in the simulation\nmagnetosphere are not due to fluctuations in the solar wind. The simulations\npresented in this study are driven by purely southward interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) conditions, changing only the solar wind driving velocity while\nholding all of the other solar wind input parameters constant. We find surface\nwaves near the dawn and dusk flank magnetopause and show that these waves are\ngenerated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. We also find that two KH\nmodes are generated near the magnetopause boundary. One mode, the magnetopause\nKH mode, propagates tailward along the magnetopause boundary. The other mode,\nthe inner KH mode, propagates tailward along the inner edge of the boundary\nlayer (IEBL). We find large vortical structures associated with the inner KH\nmode that are centered on the IEBL. The phase velocities, wavelengths, and\nfrequencies of the two KH modes are computed. The KH waves are found to be\nfairly monochromatic with well defined wavelengths. In addition, the inner and\nmagnetopause KH modes are coupled and lead to a coupled oscillation of the\nlow-latitude boundary layer. The boundary layer thickness, $d$, is computed and\nwe find maximum wave growth for $kd$ = 0.5--1.0, where $k$ is the wave number,\nconsistent with the linear theory of the KH instability. We comment briefly on\nthe effectiveness of these KH waves in the energization and transport of\nradiation belt electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 18:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

Of the three\ncolour channels (Red, Green, Blue) in a given colour image, the least two\nsignificant bits of any one of the channels of the color image is used to\nchannelize the embedding capacity of the remaining two channels. We have\ndevised three approaches to achieve various levels of our desired targets. In\nthe first approach, Red is the default guide but it results in localization of\nMSE in the remaining two channels, which makes it slightly vulnerable. In the\nsecond approach, user gets the liberty to select the guiding channel (Red,\nGreen or Blue) to guide the remaining two channels. It will increase the\nrobustness and imperceptibility of the embedded image however the MSE factor\nwill still remain as a drawback. The third approach improves the performance\nfactor as a cyclic methodology is employed and the guiding channel is selected\nin a cyclic fashion. This ensures the uniform distribution of MSE, which gives\nbetter robustness and imperceptibility along with enhanced embedding capacity.\nThe imperceptibility has been enhanced by suitably adapting optimal pixel\nadjustment process (OPAP) on the stego covers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 19:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

We show\nthat a soft edge coloring approach to both problems gives rigorous\napproximation guarantees. In the channel assignment problem arising in wireless\nnetworks a pair of edges incident to a vertex are said to be conflicting if the\nchannels assigned to them are the same. Our goal is to assign channels (color\nedges) so that the number of conflicts is minimized. The problem is NP-hard by\na reduction from Edge coloring and we present two combinatorial algorithms for\nthis case. The first algorithm is based on a distributed greedy method and\ngives a solution with at most $2(1-\\frac{1}{k})|E|$ more conflicts than the\noptimal solution.The approximation ratio if the second algorithm is $1 +\n\\frac{|V|}{|E|}$, which gives a ($1 + o(1)$)-factor for dense graphs and is the\nbest possible unless P = NP. We also consider the data migration problem in\nheterogeneous storage systems. In such systems, data layouts may need to be\nreconfigured over time for load balancing or in the event of system\nfailure/upgrades. It is critical to migrate data to their target locations as\nquickly as possible to obtain the best performance of the system. Most of the\nprevious results on data migration assume that each storage node can perform\nonly one data transfer at a time. However, storage devices tend to have\nheterogeneous capabilities as devices may be added over time due to storage\ndemand increase. We develop algorithms to minimize the data migration time. We\nshow that it is possible to find an optimal migration schedule when all $c_v$'s\nare even. Furthermore, though the problem is NP-hard in general, we give an\nefficient soft edge coloring algorithm that offers a rigorous $(1 +\no(1))$-approximation guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 19:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

The\nchallenge of the representation is that it must not only capture the\ncharacteristics of the shape but also be invariant to relevant transformations.\nInvariance to geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and\nscale, has received attention in the past, usually under the assumption that\nthe points are previously labeled, i.e., that the shape is characterized by an\nordered set of landmarks. However, in many practical scenarios, the points\ndescribing the shape are obtained from automatic processes, e.g., edge or\ncorner detection, thus without labels or natural ordering. Obviously, the\ncombinatorial problem of computing the correspondences between the points of\ntwo shapes in the presence of the aforementioned geometrical distortions\nbecomes a quagmire when the number of points is large. We circumvent this\nproblem by representing shapes in a way that is invariant to the permutation of\nthe landmarks, i.e., we represent bags of unlabeled 2D points. Within our\nframework, a shape is mapped to an analytic function on the complex plane,\nleading to what we call its analytic signature (ANSIG). To store an ANSIG, it\nsuffices to sample it along a closed contour in the complex plane. We show that\nthe ANSIG is a maximal invariant with respect to the permutation group, i.e.,\nthat different shapes have different ANSIGs and shapes that differ by a\npermutation (or re-labeling) of the landmarks have the same ANSIG. We further\nshow how easy it is to factor out geometric transformations when comparing\nshapes using the ANSIG representation. Finally, we illustrate these\ncapabilities with shape-based image classification experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 19:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-20"}

At the smallest\nangles the spectra are dominated by twist induced Van Hove singularities and\nthe Dirac fermions eventually become localized. An unexpected electron-hole\nasymmetry is observed which is substantially larger than the asymmetry in\neither single or untwisted bilayer graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 20:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-18"}

Maxwell's condition states that the edges of a\ngraph $G=(V, E)$ are {\\em independent} in its $d$-dimensional generic rigidity\nmatroid only if $(a)$ the number of edges $|E|$ $\\le$ $d|V| - {d+1\\choose 2}$,\nand $(b)$ this holds for every induced subgraph with at least $d$ vertices. We\ncall such graphs {\\em Maxwell-independent} in $d$ dimensions. Laman's theorem\nshows that the converse holds for $d=2$ and thus every maximal\nMaxwell-independent set of $G$ has size equal to the rank of the 2-dimensional\ngeneric rigidity matroid. While this is false for $d=3$, we show that every\nmaximal, Maxwell-independent set of a graph $G$ has size at least the rank of\nthe 3-dimensional generic rigidity matroid of $G$.

Since the afterglow evolution is determined by the circumburst\ndensity profile, n(r), traversed by the fireball, it can be used to distinguish\nbetween a so-called ISM profile, n(r) = const., and a free stellar wind, $n(r)\n\\propto r^{-2}$. Our goal is to derive the most probable circumburst density\nprofile for a large number of Swift-detected bursts using well-sampled\nafterglow light curves in the optical and X-ray bands. We combined all publicly\navailable optical and Swift/X-ray afterglow data from June 2005 to September\n2009 to find the best-sampled late-time afterglow light curves. After applying\nseveral selection criteria, our final sample consists of 27 bursts, including\none short burst. The afterglow evolution was then studied within the framework\nof the fireball model. We find that the majority (18) of the 27 afterglow light\ncurves are compatible with a constant density medium (ISM case). Only 6 of the\n27 afterglows show evidence for a wind profile at late times. In particular, we\nset upper limits on the wind termination-shock radius, $R_T$, for GRB fireballs\nwhich are propagating into an ISM profile and lower limits on $R_T$ for those\nwhich were found to propagate through a wind medium. Observational evidence for\nISM profiles dominates in GRB afterglow studies, implying that most GRB\nprogenitors might have relatively small wind termination-shock radii. A smaller\ngroup of progenitors, however, seems to be characterised by notably more\nextended wind regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 21:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2010 12:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Abilities\nto quickly adapt to changes, develop products with safe design, minimize\nproject costs, and deliver timely are needed. Model-based development (MBD)\nfollows a separation of concerns by abstracting systems with an appropriate\nintensity. MBD promises higher comprehension by modeling on several\nabstraction-levels, formal verification, and automated code generation. This\nthesis demonstrates MBD with the Scicos/SynDEx framework on a distributed\nembedded system. Scicos is a modeling and simulation environment for hybrid\nsystems. SynDEx is a rapid prototyping integrated development environment for\ndistributed systems. Performed examples implement well-known control algorithms\non a target system containing several networked microcontrollers, sensors, and\nactuators. The addressed research question tackles the feasibility of MBD for\nmedium-sized embedded systems. In the case of single-processor applications\nexperiments show that the comforts of tool-provided simulation, verification,\nand code-generation have to be weighed against an additional memory consumption\nin dynamic and static memory compared to a hand-written approach. Establishing\na near-seamless modeling-framework with Scicos/SynDEx is expensive. An\nincreased development effort indicates a high price for developing single\napplications, but might pay off for product families. A further drawback was\nthat the distributed code generated with SynDEx could not be adapted to\nmicrocontrollers without a significant alteration of the scheduling tables. The\nScicos/SynDEx framework forms a valuable tool set that, however, still needs\nmany improvements. Therefore, its usage is only recommended for experimental\npurposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 22:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}

Conversely, the heat kernel constructed from its\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions determines the Riemannian metric. This work\nproves the analogy on Euclidean polyhedral surfaces (triangle meshes), that the\ndiscrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and the discrete Riemannian metric (unique\nup to a scaling) are mutually determined by each other. Given an Euclidean\npolyhedral surface, its Riemannian metric is represented as edge lengths,\nsatisfying triangle inequalities on all faces. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is\nformulated using the cotangent formula, where the edge weight is defined as the\nsum of the cotangent of angles against the edge. We prove that the edge lengths\ncan be determined by the edge weights unique up to a scaling using the\nvariational approach. First, we show that the space of all possible metrics of\na polyhedral surface is convex. Then, we construct a special energy defined on\nthe metric space, such that the gradient of the energy equals to the edge\nweights. Third, we show the Hessian matrix of the energy is positive definite,\nrestricted on the tangent space of the metric space, therefore the energy is\nconvex. Finally, by the fact that the parameter on a convex domain and the\ngradient of a convex function defined on the domain have one-to-one\ncorrespondence, we show the edge weights determines the polyhedral metric\nunique up to a scaling. The constructive proof leads to a computational\nalgorithm that finds the unique metric on a topological triangle mesh from a\ndiscrete Laplace-Beltrami operator matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 23:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}

Multiplying the homogeneous coordinates of X by\nvarious fifth roots of unity gives automorphisms of X; the images of L under\nthese automorphisms defines a family of 625 different Lagrangian submanifolds,\ncalled real Lagrangians. In this paper we try to calculate the Floer cohomology\nbetween all pairs of these Lagrangians. We are able to complete most of the\ncalculations, but there are a few cases we cannot do.\n  The basic idea is to explicitly describe some low energy moduli spaces and\nthen use this knowledge to calculate the differential on the E_2 page of the\nstandard spectral sequence for Floer cohomology. It turns out that this is\noften enough to calculate the cohomology completely. Several techniques are\ndeveloped to help describe these low energy moduli spaces, including a formula\nfor the Maslov index, a formula for the obstruction bundle, and a way to relate\nholomorphic strips and discs to holomorphic spheres. The real nature of the\nLagrangians is crucial for the development of these techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2010 23:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-21"}

We investigate associated systematic biases. We show that removing\nline-of-sight fluctuations on large scales aliases into suppression of the 3D\npower spectrum across a broad range of scales. This bias can be eliminated by\nmarginalizing over small k in the 1D power spectrum; however, the unbiased\nestimator will have unavoidably larger variance. We also show that Gaussian\nrealizations of the power spectrum permit accurate and extremely rapid\nMonte-Carlo simulations for error analysis; repeated realizations of the fully\nnon-Gaussian field are unnecessary. We perform Monte-Carlo maximum-likelihood\nsimulations of foreground removal which yield unbiased, minimum variance\nestimates of the power spectrum in agreement with Fisher matrix estimates.\nForeground removal also distorts the 21cm PDF, reducing the contrast between\nneutral and ionized regions. We show that it is the subtraction of large-scales\nmodes which is responsible for this distortion, and that it is less severe in\nthe earlier stages of reionization. It can be reduced by using larger\nbandwidths for foreground removal. In the late stages of reionization, the\nlargest ionized regions (which consist of foreground emission only) provides\ncalibration points which potentially allow recovery of large-scale modes.\nFinally, we also show that: (i) the broad frequency response of synchrotron and\nfree-free emission will smear out any features in the electron momentum\ndistribution and ensure spectrally smooth foregrounds; (ii) extragalactic radio\nrecombination lines should be negligible foregrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 06:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2011 05:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Such\ncoding has many applications in science and engineering and is believed to play\nan important role in neural information processing. However, due to the\ncomputational complexity of the task, only approximate solutions provide the\nrequired efficiency (in terms of time). As new results show, under particular\nconditions there exist efficient solutions by minimizing the magnitude of the\ncoefficients (`$l_1$-norm') instead of minimizing the size of the active subset\nof features (`$l_0$-norm'). Straightforward neural implementation of these\nsolutions is not likely, as they require \\emph{a priori} knowledge of the\nnumber of active features. Furthermore, these methods utilize iterative\nre-evaluation of the reconstruction error, which in turn implies that final\nsparse forms (featuring `population sparseness') can only be reached through\nthe formation of a series of non-sparse representations, which is in contrast\nwith the overall sparse functioning of the neural systems (`lifetime\nsparseness').

The biophysical properties of\nthese neurons are essential for the operation of the vestibular neural\nintegrator that converts a head velocity signal to one that controls eye\nposition. A novel method named QSA (quadratic sinusoidal analysis) for voltage\nclamped neurons was used to quantify nonlinear responses that are dominated by\ndendrites. The voltage clamp currents were measured at harmonic and interactive\nfrequencies using specific stimulation frequencies, which act as frequency\nprobes of the intrinsic nonlinear neuronal behavior. These responses to paired\nfrequencies form a matrix that can be reduced by eigendecomposition to provide\na very compact piecewise quadratic analysis at different membrane potentials\nthat otherwise is usually described by complex differential equations involving\na large numbers of parameters and dendritic compartments. Moreover, the QSA\nmatrix can be interpolated to capture most of the nonlinear neuronal behavior\nlike a Volterra kernel. The interpolated quadratic functions of the two major\nprepositus hypoglossi neurons, namely type B and D, are strikingly different. A\nmajor part of the nonlinear responses is due to the persistent sodium\nconductance, which appears to be essential for sustained nonlinear effects\ninduced by NMDA activation and thus would be critical for the operation of the\nneural integrator. Finally, the dominance of the nonlinear responses by the\ndendrites supports the hypothesis that persistent sodium conductance channels\nand NMDA receptors act synergistically to dynamically control the influence of\nindividual synaptic inputs on network behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 09:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2010 14:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

The asymptotic properties are established for the proposed estimators\nconsidering both numerical error and measurement error. The B-spline is used to\napproximate the time-varying coefficients, and the corresponding asymptotic\ntheories in this case are investigated under the framework of the sieve\napproach. Our results show that if the maximum step size of the $p$-order\nnumerical algorithm goes to zero at a rate faster than $n^{-1/(p\\wedge4)}$, the\nnumerical error is negligible compared to the measurement error. This result\nprovides a theoretical guidance in selection of the step size for numerical\nevaluations of ODEs.

The sieve\nestimator of constant parameters is asymptotically normal with the same\nasymptotic co-variance as that of the case where the true ODE solution is\nexactly known, while the estimator of the time-varying parameter has the\noptimal convergence rate under some regularity conditions.

We have probed the transformation of graphene\nupon hydrogenation to graphane within the framework of density functional\ntheory. By analyzing the electronic structure for eighteen different hydrogen\nconcentrations, we bring out some novel features of this transition. Our\nresults show that the hydrogenation favors clustered configurations leading to\nthe formation of compact islands. The analysis of the charge density and\nelectron localization function (ELF) indicates that as hydrogen coverage\nincreases the semi-metal turns into a metal showing a delocalized charge\ndensity, then transforms into an insulator. The metallic phase is spatially\ninhomogeneous in the sense, it contains the islands of insulating regions\nformed by hydrogenated carbon atoms and the metallic channels formed by\ncontiguous bare carbon atoms. It turns out that it is possible to pattern the\ngraphene sheet to tune the electronic structure. For example removal of\nhydrogen atoms along the diagonal of the unit cell yielding an armchair pattern\nat the edge gives rise to a band gap of 1.4 eV. We also show that a weak\nferromagnetic state exists even for a large hydrogen coverage whenever there is\na sub-lattice imbalance in presence of odd number of hydrogen atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 11:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-05"}

This work aims to identify signs of evolution\nof early-type galaxies through the study of parameter correlations using a\nsample of 135 field galaxies extracted from the Extended Groth Strip in the\nredshift range 0.2<z<1.2. Using DEEP2 data, we calculate the internal velocity\ndispersions by extracting the stellar kinematics from absorption line spectra,\nusing a maximum penalized likelihood approach. Morphology was determined\nthrough visual classification using the V+I images of ACS. The structural\nparameters of these galaxies were obtained by fitting de Vaucouleurs stellar\nprofiles to the ACS I-band images, using the GALFIT code. S\\'ersic and\nbulge-to-disc decomposition models were also fitted to our sample of galaxies,\nand we found a good agreement in the Fundamental Plane derived from the three\nmodels.

They exhibit a pronounced variability of\ntheir luminosity with a more or less well defined period and suffer large mass\nloss in the form of stellar winds. Due to this extensive mass loss, LPVs and\nMiras are surrounded by extended circumstellar dust shells (CDSs). The dynamics\nof these envelopes is the result of a complex interplay via an external\nexcitation by the pulsating central star, dust formation and radiative\ntransfer. Our study is aimed at an understanding of the dynamics of CDSs around\ncarbon-rich, standard luminous LPVs and Miras. These shells often show\nmultiperiodicity with secondary periods as high as a few 10^4 d superimposed on\na main period which is in the range of approximately 10^2-10^3 d. Such\nsecondary periods may be caused at least in part by the presence of dust. We\nconsider an excitation of the CDSs by either a harmonic force, provided by the\noscillation of the central star, or by a stochastic force with a continuous\npower spectrum. The resulting numerically computed dynamical behaviour of the\nshell is analysed with the help of Fourier analysis and stroboscopic maps. CDSs\nmay be described as multioscillatory systems which are driven by the pulsating\nstars. A set of normal modes can be identified. The obtained periods of these\nmodes are of the order of some 10^3 d, which is a characteristic timescale for\ndust nucleation, growth and elemental enrichment in the dust formation zone.\nDepending on the oscillation period and strength of the central star, the\nenvelope reacts periodically, multi- periodically or irregularly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2010 12:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 17:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We study the\neffects of a secondary with/without eccentricity on the dust population to\ndetermine what sizes the aggregates can reach and how that compares to the dust\npopulation in disks around single stars.\n  We find that the secondary star has two effects on the dust population. 1.)\nThe disk is truncated due to the presence of the secondary star and the maximum\nmass of the particles is decreased in the lowered gas densities.

The perturbation of the secondary pumps up the\neccentricity of the gas disk, which in turn increases the relative velocity\nbetween the dust and the gas.

GeV\ngamma-ray pulsations from both were discovered using the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope. Twelve years of radio and polarization data allow detailed\ninvestigations. The two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and in\ngamma-ray data. Both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset far\nfrom the radio peak. The high dispersion measure for PSR J0248+6021 (DM = 370\npc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant HII region W5\nin the Perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the Galaxy as\nobtained from models of average electron distributions.
