Here, we study the four SNe IIn observed by the Caltech\nCore-Collapse Project (CCCP). The CCCP SN sample is unbiased to the extent that\nobject selection was not influenced by target SN properties. Therefore, these\nevents are representative of the observed population of SNe IIn. We find that a\nnarrow P-Cygni profile in the hydrogen Balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitous\nfeature of SNe IIn. Our light curves show a relatively long rise time (>20\ndays) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01 to 0.15 mag/day), and a typical\nV-band peak magnitude of M_V=-18.4 +/- 1.0 mag. We measure the progenitor star\nwind velocities (600 - 1400 km/s) for the SNe in our sample and derive\npre-explosion mass loss rates (0.026 - 0.12 solar masses per year). We compile\nsimilar data for SNe IIn from the literature, and discuss our results in the\ncontext of this larger sample. Our results indicate that typical SNe IIn arise\nfrom progenitor stars that undergo LBV-like mass-loss shortly before they\nexplode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 16:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The data analysed come\nfrom an empirical study conducted on an architectural design meeting. Based on\na previous analysis of the data, guided by our model of design as the\nconstruction of representations, we distinguish representational and\norganisational functions. The results of the present analysis are that, even if\nform-function association tendencies exist, gestures with a particular function\nmay take various forms, and particular gestural movements as regards form can\nfulfil different functions. Reconsidering these results and other research on\ngesture, we formulate the assumption that, if formal characteristics do not\nallow differentiating functional gestures in collaboration, context-dependent,\nsemantic characteristics may be more appropriate. We also envision the\npossibility that closer inspection of the data reveal tendencies of another\nnature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 17:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

A driving ambition has been\nto make the geometry behind the well definition and basic properties of CSI as\nclear and elementary as possible. CSI then yields a very natural and elementary\nproof of a remarkable theorem of J. C. Cantrell and J. R. Stallings. It asserts\nunknotting of proper embeddings of euclidean (m-1)-space in euclidean m-space\nwith m not equal to 3, for all three classical manifold categories:\ntopological, piecewise linear, and differentiable. It is one of the few major\ntheorems whose statement and proof can be the same for all three categories. We\ngive it the acronym HLT, which is short for Hyperplane Linearization Theorem.\nThe topological version of the HLT immediately implies B. Mazur's topological\nSchoenflies theorem. We can thus claim that the Cantrell-Stallings theorem, as\nwe present it, is an enhancement of the topological Schoenflies theorem that\nhas exceptional didactic value. We also prove a classification of multiple\ncodimension 1 hyperplane embeddings in eucldiean m-space for m not equal to 3.\nNamely, they are classified by countable simplicial trees with one edge for\neach hyperplane (planar trees for m=2). This result is called the Multiple\nHyperplane Linearization Theorem, or MHLT for short. We give an exposition of\nC. Greathouse's Slab Theorem, and in conclusion some possibly novel proofs of\nthe 2-dimensional MHLT and related results classifying contractible 2-manifolds\nwith boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 17:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

The low observed escape fractions of ionizing radiation have\nnot been adequately explained, and there is evidence that some starbursts have\nhigh escape fractions. We examine the spectral energy distributions of a sample\nof local star-forming galaxies, containing thirteen local starburst galaxies\nand ten of their ordinary star-forming counterparts, to determine if there\nexist significant differences in the fate of ionizing radiation in these\ngalaxies. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the SEDs is much\nlarger than any systematic differences between starbursts and non-starbursts.\nFor example, we find no significant differences in the total absorption of\nionizing radiation by dust, traced by the 24um, 70um, and 160um MIPS bands of\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope, although the dust in starburst galaxies appears to\nbe hotter than that of non-starburst galaxies. We also observe no excess\nultraviolet flux in the GALEX bands that could indicate a high escape fraction\nof ionizing photons in starburst galaxies. The small H-alpha fractions of the\ndiffuse, warm ionized medium in starburst galaxies are apparently due to\ntemporarily boosted H-alpha luminosity within the star-forming regions\nthemselves, with an independent, constant WIM luminosity. This independence of\nthe WIM and starburst luminosities contrasts with WIM behavior in non-starburst\ngalaxies and underscores our poor understanding of radiation transfer in both\nordinary and starburst galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 18:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Some authors who have studied this problem have\ncome to the conclusion that it is not possible that terrestrial life originated\nhere and that, in reality, life originated giga-years ago, before the solar\nsystem existed. If we accept this conclusion there is no other option than to\nadmit that panspermia is something viable.The goal of this study is to propose\na viable hypothesis for the transport of SLF from one planetary system to\nanother. During the formation period of a planetary system giant planets can\neject planets the size of the Earth, or larger, turning them into free-floating\nplanets in interstellar space. These free-floating planets have also been\ncalled free floaters. If a free floater, which has developed life, enters a\nlifeless planetary system, it can seed the worlds of this system with SLF\ndragged by the stellar wind from one planet to another or by great impacts on\nthe free planet. To support this hypothesis, I calculate the probability that\none free floater reaches the planets zone of a planetary system, and also it\nwas calculated the time it remains within the planetary zone in order to see if\nthere is enough time to seed the host system.The probability of a free floater\nin the galaxy, within the region of the Sun, entering the planet zone of a\nsystem is 2.8x10-4, i.e., that {\\sim}3 of 10,000 free planets manage to enter\nsome planetary system. At the galactocentric distance from the Sun I calculated\nthat there are 21,495 free floaters floating around the galactic center. Hence,\n6 free-floating planets manage to enter in planetary systems every galaxy\nrotation. Since the galaxy has rotated 54 times since its formation, then,\n{\\sim} 324 free floaters have entered some planetary system at the\ngalactocentric distance of the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 19:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-14"}

In the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepest\noccurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdB (0.4%) and\nthe more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdB eclipses the white dwarf. As\nexpected, the sdB is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,\nwhich produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. Spectacularly, a\nvery strong Doppler beaming (aka Doppler boosting) effect is also clearly\nevident at the 0.1% level. This originates from the sdB's orbital velocity,\nwhich we measure to be 164.0\\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. We\npresent light curve models that account for all these effects, as well as\ngravitational lensing. We derive system parameters and uncertainties from the\nlight curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations.

This implies a different CO-to-H2 conversion factor, which is on\naverage a factor of two lower than the inner disk and the extragalactic\naverage. We attribute this to significantly higher measured brightness\ntemperatures of the outer disk clouds compared to the ancillary sample of GMCs,\nwhich is likely an effect of enhanced radiation levels due to massive star\nformation in the vicinity of our target field.

For two large subcommunities of theoretical high energy\nphysics, we find a clear \"reverse-visibility\" effect, in which articles near\nthe ends of the lists receive a boost in both short-term readership and\nlong-term citations, almost comparable in size to the \"visibility\" effect\ndocumented earlier. For one of those subcommunities, we find an additional\n\"procrastination\" effect, in which last position articles submitted shortly\nbefore the deadline have an even higher citation rate than those that land more\naccidentally in that position. We consider and eliminate geographic effects as\nresponsible for the above, and speculate on other possible causes, including\n\"oblivious\" and \"nightowl\" effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 20:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

Here we present a versatile\nnumerical tool, DustEM, that predicts the emission and extinction of dust given\ntheir size distribution and their optical and thermal properties. In order to\nmodel dust evolution, DustEM has been designed to deal with a variety of grain\ntypes, structures and size distributions and to be able to easily include new\ndust physics. We use DustEM to model the dust SED and extinction in the diffuse\ninterstellar medium at high-galactic latitude (DHGL), a natural reference SED.\nWe present a coherent set of observations for the DHGL SED. The dust components\nin our DHGL model are (i) PAHs, (ii) amorphous carbon and (iii) amorphous\nsilicates. We use amorphous carbon dust, rather than graphite, because it\nbetter explains the observed high abundances of gas-phase carbon in shocked\nregions of the interstellar medium. Using the DustEM model, we illustrate how,\nin the optically thin limit, the IRAS/Planck HFI (and likewise Spitzer/Herschel\nfor smaller spatial scales) photometric band ratios of the dust SED can\ndisentangle the influence of the exciting radiation field intensity and\nconstrain the abundance of small grains relative to the larger grains. We also\ndiscuss the contributions of the different grain populations to the IRAS,\nPlanck and Herschel channels. Such information is required to enable a study of\nthe evolution of dust as well as to systematically extract the dust thermal\nemission from CMB data and to analyze the emission in the Planck polarized\nchannels.

Numerical simulations of binary\nblack holes are important tools both for calibrating analytical templates for\ngravitational-wave detection and for exploring the nonlinear dynamics of curved\nspacetime. However, all previous simulations of binary-black-hole inspiral,\nmerger, and ringdown have been limited by an apparently insurmountable barrier:\nthe merging holes' spins could not exceed 0.93, which is still a long way from\nthe maximum possible value in terms of the physical effects of the spin. In\nthis paper, we surpass this limit for the first time, opening the way to\nexplore numerically the behavior of merging, nearly extremal black holes.\nSpecifically, using an improved initial-data method suitable for binary black\nholes with nearly extremal spins, we simulate the inspiral (through 12.5\norbits), merger and ringdown of two equal-mass black holes with equal spins of\nmagnitude 0.95 antialigned with the orbital angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 21:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2011 15:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2011 04:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

When signal-to-noise ratios are not quite symmetric, a fraction of\nthe multiplexing gain is achieved.

Last, we find that the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds\ndecreases away from the Galactic center, suggesting a possible decline in the\nstar formation rate with Galactocentric radius. There is a marginally\nsignificant enhancement in the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds at\na Galactocentric radius of about 6 kpc, which in the longitude range of the GRS\ncorresponds to the Sagittarius arm.

This paper introduces Stokes phase portraits as a supplementary\ndiagnostic tool with which the orientation and magnetic geometry can be\ninferred more accurately. The Stokes phase portraits feature unique patterns in\nthe I-Q, I-U, and Q-U planes, whose shapes depend sensitively on the magnetic\ngeometry, inclination angle, beam and polarization patterns, and emission\naltitude. We construct look-up tables of Stokes phase portraits and PA swings\nfor pure and current-modified dipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams,\nand two empirical linear polarization models, L/I = \\cos \\theta_0 and L/I =\n\\sin \\theta_0, where \\theta_0 is the colatitude of the emission point. We\ncompare our look-up tables to the measured phase portraits of 24 pulsars in the\nEuropean Pulsar Network online database.

These four macroscopics are\nenough to accurately describe the dynamics of the trait mean and of its genetic\nvariance (and in principle of any other quantity).

The nanoparticles\nput under scrutiny, {\\gamma}-Fe2O3 or maghemite, have diameter of 6.7 nm and\n8.3 nm and narrow polydispersity. The co-assembly is driven by i) the\nelectrostatic interactions between the polymers and the particles, and by ii)\nthe presence of an externally applied magnetic field. The rods are\ncharacterized by large anisotropy factors, with diameter 200 nm and length\ncomprised between 1 and 100 {\\mu}m. In the present work, we provide for the\nfirst time the morphology diagram for the rods as a function of ionic strength\nand concentration. We show the existence of a critical nanoparticle\nconcentration and of a critical ionic strength beyond which the rods do not\nform. In the intermediate regimes, only tortuous and branched aggregates are\ndetected. At higher concentrations and lower ionic strengths, linear and stiff\nrods with superparamagnetic properties are produced. Based on these data, a\nmechanism for the rod formation is proposed. The mechanism proceeds in two\nsteps : the formation and growth of spherical clusters of particles, and the\nalignment of the clusters induced by the magnetic dipolar interactions. As far\nas the kinetics of these processes is concerned, the clusters growth and their\nalignment occur concomitantly, leading to a continuous accretion of particles\nor small clusters, and a welding of the rodlike structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 08:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-15"}

Clear evidence\nsupporting the dimensionality dependence of the scaling exponent of the\nautoresponse function is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 15:25:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 14:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 13:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-02"}

Although the lack of a measured parallax\nprecludes knowing the exact evolutionary phase, an isochrone-derived estimate\nof its luminosity places the star on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a\nlocation that is not consistent with either the red bump on the first ascent of\nthe red giant branch or with the second ascent on the asymptotic giant branch,\nthe two evolutionary stages where lithium-rich giant stars tend to cluster.\nThus, even among the already unusual group of lithium-rich giant stars,\nG0928+73.2600 is peculiar. Using 12C/13C as a tracer for mixing---more mixing\nleads to lower 12C/13C---we find 12C/13C = 28, which is near the expected value\nfor standard first dredge-up mixing. We can therefore conclude that \"extra\"\ndeep mixing has not occurred. Regardless of the ambiguity of the evolutionary\nstage, the extremely large lithium abundance and the rotational velocity of\nthis star are unusual, and we speculate that G0928+73.2600 has been enriched in\nboth lithium and angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2010 15:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-15"}
