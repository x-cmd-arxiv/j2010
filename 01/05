In this work we make predictions for\nquark and gluon jet shape distributions in N-jet final states in e+e-\ncollisions, defined with a cone or recombination algorithm, where we measure\nsome jet shape observable on a subset of these jets. Using the framework of\nSoft-Collinear Effective Theory, we prove a factorization theorem for jet shape\ndistributions and demonstrate the consistent renormalization-group running of\nthe functions in the factorization theorem for any number of measured and\nunmeasured jets, any number of quark and gluon jets, and any angular size R of\nthe jets, as long as R is much smaller than the angular separation between\njets. We calculate the jet and soft functions for angularity jet shapes \\tau_a\nto one-loop order (O(alpha_s)) and resum a subset of the large logarithms of\n\\tau_a needed for next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy for both cone and\nkT-type jets.

Building on a previous\nresult of Aaronson et al, this implies that there is an efficient quantum\nalgorithm to verify 3-SAT with constant soundness, given two unentangled proofs\nof O(sqrt(n) polylog(n)) qubits. We also show how QMA(2) with log-sized proofs\nis equivalent to a large number of problems, some related to quantum\ninformation (such as testing separability of mixed states) as well as problems\nwithout any apparent connection to quantum mechanics (such as computing\ninjective tensor norms of 3-index tensors). As a consequence, we obtain many\nhardness-of-approximation results, as well as potential algorithmic\napplications of methods for approximating QMA(2) acceptance probabilities.\nFinally, our test can also be used to construct an efficient test for\ndetermining whether a unitary operator is a tensor product, which is a\ngeneralisation of classical linearity testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 18:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 08:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 09:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 22:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 19:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 19:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-03"}

It is known that a decrease of swimming speed with density can\npromote separation into bulk phases of two coexisting densities; this is\nopposed by the logistic law for birth and death which allows only a single\nuniform density to be stable. The result of this contest is an arrested\nnonequilibrium phase separation in which dense droplets or rings become\nseparated by less dense regions, with a characteristic steady-state length\nscale. Cell division mainly occurs in the dilute regions and cell death in the\ndense ones, with a continuous flux between these sustained by the diffusivity\ngradient. We formulate a mathematical model of this in a case involving\nrun-and-tumble bacteria, and make connections with a wider class of mechanisms\nfor density-dependent motility. No chemotaxis is assumed in the model, yet it\npredicts the formation of patterns strikingly similar to those believed to\nresult from chemotactic behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 19:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-13"}

Indeed a recent\nchampion of Bayesian methods, E. T. Jaynes, titled his textbook on the subject\nProbability Theory: the Logic of Science. Many philosophers of science\nincluding Karl Popper and Donald Campbell have interpreted the evolution of\nScience as a Darwinian process consisting of a 'copy with selective retention'\nalgorithm abstracted from Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. Arguments are\npresented for an isomorphism between Bayesian Methods and Darwinian processes.\nUniversal Darwinism, as the term has been developed by Richard Dawkins, Daniel\nDennett and Susan Blackmore, is the collection of scientific theories which\nexplain the creation and evolution of their subject matter as due to the\noperation of Darwinian processes. These subject matters span the fields of\natomic physics, chemistry, biology and the social sciences. The principle of\nMaximum Entropy states that systems will evolve to states of highest entropy\nsubject to the constraints of scientific law. This principle may be inverted to\nprovide illumination as to the nature of scientific law. Our best cosmological\ntheories suggest the universe contained much less complexity during the period\nshortly after the Big Bang than it does at present. The scientific subject\nmatter of atomic physics, chemistry, biology and the social sciences has been\ncreated since that time. An explanation is proposed for the existence of this\nsubject matter as due to the evolution of constraints in the form of\nadaptations imposed on Maximum Entropy. It is argued these adaptations were\ndiscovered and instantiated through the operations of a succession of Darwinian\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 17:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

This is the first in-depth analysis of the X-ray\nspectral characteristics of this source. We found that the flux of 1ES 1210-646\nvaries by a factor of about 3 on a timescale of hundreds of seconds and by a\nfactor of at least 10 among observations acquired over a time span of several\nmonths. The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron. Although the X-ray spectral description we find for the 1ES\n1210-646 emission is quite atypical for a high-mass X-ray binary, the\nmultiwavelegth information available for this object leads us to confirm this\nclassification. The results presented here allow us instead to definitely rule\nout the possibility that 1ES 1210-646 is a (magnetic) cataclysmic variable as\nproposed previously and, in a broader sense, a white dwarf nature for the\naccretor is disfavoured. X-ray spectroscopic data actually suggest a neutron\nstar with a low magnetic field as the accreting object in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

However, an additional\nplanetary formation route may exist in old evolved binary systems. In such\nsystems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where\nmass transferred from the expanding evolved star to its binary companion could\nform an accretion disk around it. Such a disk could provide the necessary\nenvironment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both\ncircumstellar or circumbinary configurations. Pre-existing first generation\nplanets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for,\nand/or interact with, the second generation planets, possibly forming atypical\nplanetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically\nfound in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational\nsignatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment\nwhich are inaccessible, or less favorable, for first generation planets. The\norbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be\nforbidden (in terms of the system stability) to first generation planets in the\npre-evolved progenitor binaries.

However, the excessive x-ray\nimaging dose from serial CBCT scans raises a clinical concern in most IGRT\nprocedures. The excessive imaging dose can be effectively reduced by reducing\nthe number of x-ray projections and/or lowering mAs levels in a CBCT scan. The\ngoal of this work is to develop a fast GPU-based algorithm to reconstruct high\nquality CBCT images from undersampled and noisy projection data so as to lower\nthe imaging dose. The CBCT is reconstructed by minimizing an energy functional\nconsisting of a data fidelity term and a total variation regularization term.\nWe developed a GPU-friendly version of the forward-backward splitting algorithm\nto solve this model. A multi-grid technique is also employed. We test our CBCT\nreconstruction algorithm on a digital NCAT phantom and a head-and-neck patient\ncase. The performance under low mAs is also validated using a physical Catphan\nphantom and a head-and-neck Rando phantom. It is found that 40 x-ray\nprojections are sufficient to reconstruct CBCT images with satisfactory quality\nfor IGRT patient alignment purpose. Phantom experiments indicated that CBCT\nimages can be successfully reconstructed with our algorithm under as low as 0.1\nmAs/projection level. Comparing with currently widely used full-fan\nhead-and-neck scanning protocol of about 360 projections with 0.4\nmAs/projection, it is estimated that an overall 36 times dose reduction has\nbeen achieved with our algorithm. Moreover, the reconstruction time is about\n130 sec on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card, which is estimated ~100 times faster\nthan similar iterative reconstruction approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 22:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2010 20:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-13"}

Recently we have defined the scale of homogeneity to\nbe the scale above which the deviation of fractal dimension from the ambient\ndimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion. In this paper we use\nthe relation between the fractal dimensions and the correlation function to\ncompute the dispersion for any given model in the limit of weak clustering\namplitude. We compare the deviation and dispersion for the LCDM model and\ndiscuss the implication of this comparison for the expected scale of\nhomogeneity in the concordant model of cosmology.

Actual\nestimates of the scale of homogeneity should be smaller than this as we have\nconsidered only statistical contribution to the dispersion in fractal dimension\nand we have ignored cosmic variance and contributions due to survey geometry\nand the selection function.

In this work, a new approach based on quantum Monte-Carlo\naddressing this problem is presented. The exact dynamics of a system coupled to\nan environment is replaced by a set of stochastic evolutions of the system\ndensity. The quantum Monte-Carlo method is applied to systems with quadratic\npotentials. In all range of temperature and coupling, the stochastic method\nmatches the exact evolution showing that non-Markovian effects can be simulated\naccurately. A comparison with other theories like Nakajima-Zwanzig or\nTime-ConvolutionLess ones shows that only the latter can be competitive if the\nexpansion in terms of coupling constant is made at least to fourth order. A\nsystematic study of the inverted parabola case is made at different\ntemperatures and coupling constants.

We find no evidence of coherent\nlarge-scale galactic outflows. Instead multiple narrow emission line components\nseen within a radius of ~1-1.5 kpc, and high [SII]/H_alpha ratios found beyond\n~2 kpc implying a strong contribution from shocks, suggest that the intense\nstar formation is driving material outwards from the main star forming zone in\nthe form of a series of interacting superbubbles/shells.\n  A broad component (100<FWHM<230 km/s) to the H_alpha line is identified\nthroughout galaxy disk out to >2 kpc.

Our data suggest a physical limit to the radius where the broad\nemission line component is significant, and we propose that this limit marks a\nsignificant transition point in the development of the galactic outflow, where\nturbulent motion becomes less dominant.

Mumford,\n\\emph{Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal.,} 23 (2007), pp. 74--113] for plane curves to\nthe case of hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb R^n$. Let $M$ be a compact connected\noriented $n-1$ dimensional manifold without boundary like the sphere or the\ntorus. Then shape space is either the manifold of submanifolds of $\\mathbb R^n$\nof type $M$, or the orbifold of immersions from $M$ to $\\mathbb R^n$ modulo the\ngroup of diffeomorphisms of $M$. We investigate almost local Riemannian metrics\non shape space. These are induced by metrics of the following form on the space\nof immersions: $$ G_f(h,k) = \\int_{M}\n\\Phi(\\on{Vol}(f),\\operatorname{Tr}(L))\\g(h, k) \\operatorname{vol}(f^*\\g),$$\nwhere $\\g$ is the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb R^n$, $f^*\\g$ is the induced\nmetric on $M$, $h,k\\in C^\\infty(M,\\mathbb R^n)$ are tangent vectors at $f$ to\nthe space of embeddings or immersions, where $\\Phi:\\mathbb R^2\\to \\mathbb\nR_{>0}$ is a suitable smooth function, $\\operatorname{Vol}(f) =\n\\int_M\\operatorname{vol}(f^*\\g)$ is the total hypersurface volume of $f(M)$,\nand the trace $\\operatorname{Tr}(L)$ of the Weingarten mapping is the mean\ncurvature. For these metrics we compute the geodesic equations both on the\nspace of immersions and on shape space, the conserved momenta arising from the\nobvious symmetries, and the sectional curvature. For special choices of $\\Phi$\nwe give complete formulas for the sectional curvature. Numerical experiments\nillustrate the behavior of these metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2010 15:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 15:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2010 06:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2011 10:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 15:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

He introduces a new method for evidence\nevaluation based on the idea of Voronoi tessellation and requiring samples from\nthe posterior distribution obtained through MCMC based methods. He compares its\naccuracy and efficiency with MultiNest, concluding that it outperforms\nMultiNest in several cases. This comparison is completely unfair since the\nproposed method can not perform the complete Bayesian data analysis including\nposterior exploration and evidence evaluation on its own while MultiNest allows\none to perform Bayesian data analysis end to end. Furthermore, their criticism\nof nested sampling (and in turn MultiNest) is based on a few conceptual\nmisunderstandings of the algorithm.
