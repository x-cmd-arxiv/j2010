Predictions\nthus far have focused on subsets of landscape vacua that share most properties\nwith our own. Using the entropic principle (the assumption that entropy\nproduction traces the formation of complex structures such as observers), we\nderive six predictions that apply to the whole landscape. Typical observers\nfind themselves in a flat universe, at the onset of vacuum domination,\nsurrounded by a recently produced bath of relativistic quanta. These quanta are\nneither very dilute nor condensed, and thus appear as a roughly thermal\nbackground. Their characteristic wavelength is of order the inverse fourth root\nof the vacuum energy. These predictions hold for completely arbitrary\nobservers, in arbitrary vacua with potentially exotic particle physics and\ncosmology. They agree with observation: We live in a flat universe at the onset\nof vacuum domination, whose dominant entropy production process (the glow of\ngalactic dust) has recently produced a radiation bath (the cosmic infrared\nbackground). This radiation is marginally dilute, relativistic, and has a\nwavelength of order 100 microns, as predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 19:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 08:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-17"}

Between 280 and 310 K, the dielectric constant curve shows a peak centered\nat zero magnetic field and thereafter decreases monotonically up to 0.1 T,\nexhibiting a magnetodielectric effect of 1.1%. This effect is ascribed to the\nrealization of magnetic field-induced ferroelectricity at an H value of less\nthan 0.1 T near room temperature. Comparison between electric and magnetic\nphase diagrams in wide temperature- and field-windows suggests that the\nmagnetic field for inducing ferroelectricity has decreased near its helical\nspin ordering temperature around 315 K due to the reduction of spin anisotropy\nin Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2Fe12O22.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 16:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-11"}

The campaign consists of 7 observations. We analyze the\nresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizing\nflux variations. Despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impinging\ncontinuum, the soft X-ray spectra of the source show little spectral\nvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. A detailed time\nmodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing component\nwith high ionization. Instead, the models tentatively suggest that the\nionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changing\nwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.\nUsing the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e <2.0E7 cm-3 for the\nelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocity\ncomponent. This implies a large distance from the continuum source (R > 0.033\npc). If the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e\n>9.8E4 cm-3 and R < 3 pc. We discuss our results in terms of two different\nscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of the\naccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. Given\nthe large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (Mw\n> 0.08 Maccr). The associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in the\nhost galaxy (>1.2E56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,\npossibly regulating large scale star formation. The total mass and energy\nejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,\neven when extrapolated to quasar luminosities. Such feedback would require that\nwe are observing the wind before it is fully accelerated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 19:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

If this is the case, charged particles\nfrom the fully ionised intra-cluster medium (ICM) will be prevented,\nordinarily, from crossing the boundary by the Lorentz force. However, recent\nobservations indicate that thermal material may occupy up to 50% of the volume\nof some bubbles. Given the effect of the Lorentz force, the thermal content\nmust then be attributed to one, or a combination, of the following processes:\ni) the entrainment of thermal gas into the AGN outflow that inflated the\nbubble; ii) rapid diffusion across the magnetic field lines at the ICM/bubble\ninterface; iii) magnetic reconnection events which transfer thermal material\nacross the ICM/bubble boundary. Unless the AGN outflow behaves as a magnetic\ntower jet, entrainment may be significant and could explain the observed\nthermal content of bubbles. Alternatively, the cross-field diffusion\ncoefficient required for the ICM to fill a typical bubble is roughly 10^16 cm^2\ns^-1, which is anomalously high compared to predictions from turbulent\ndiffusion models. Finally, the mass transfer rate due to magnetic reconnection\nis uncertain, but significant for plausible reconnection rates. We conclude\nthat entrainment into the outflow and mass transfer due to magnetic\nreconnection events are probably the most significant sources of thermal\ncontent in AGN-blown bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 21:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The main approach to deciding the feasibility\nof network coding problems aims to reduce the problem to optimization over a\npolytope of entropic vectors subject to constraints imposed by the network\nstructure. In the case of directed acyclic graphs, these constraints are\ncompletely understood, but for general graphs the problem of enumerating them\nremains open: it is not known how to classify the constraints implied by a\nproperty that we call serializability, which refers to the absence of\nparadoxical circular dependencies in a network code.\n  In this work we initiate the first systematic study of the constraints\nimposed on a network code by serializability. We find that serializability\ncannot be detected solely by evaluating the Shannon entropy of edge sets in the\ngraph, but nevertheless, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that decides the\nserializability of a network code. We define a certificate of\nnon-serializability, called an information vortex, that plays a role in the\ntheory of serializability comparable to the role of fractional cuts in\nmulticommodity flow theory, including a type of min-max relation. Finally, we\nstudy the serializability deficit of a network code, defined as the minimum\nnumber of extra bits that must be sent in order to make it serializable. For\nlinear codes, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this parameter within a\nconstant factor, and we demonstrate some surprising facts about the behavior of\nthis parameter under parallel composition of codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 22:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-12"}

By changing the network properties, we also find that, comparing to\ndensely connected homogeneous networks, the advantage of the small-degree\npinning strategy is more distinct in sparsely connected heterogenous networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2010 03:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This indicates that the circumstellar disk\nis formed before the protostar formation with a size of ~10AU, which means that\nno protoplanetary disk smaller than <10AU exists. Reflecting the thermodynamics\nof the collapsing gas, at the protostar formation epoch, the circumstellar disk\nhas a mass of ~0.01-0.1 solar mass, while the protostar has a mass of ~10^-3\nsolar mass. Thus, just after the protostar formation, the circumstellar disk is\nabout 10-100 times more massive than the protostar.

In this\ninterpretation, the distinct states are not eigenstates of the full\nHamiltonian. Hence, there is an interaction which makes the distinct states act\nas doorways into background states which are modeled statistically. The crucial\nquantities are the overlaps between the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian and\nthe doorway states, that is, the coupling coefficients occuring in the\nexpansion of true eigenstates in the simple model basis. Recently, the\ndistribution of the maximum coupling coefficients was introduced as a new,\nhighly sensitive statistical observable. In the particularly important regime\nof weak interactions, this distribution is very well approximated by the\nfidelity distribution, defined as the distribution of the overlap between the\ndoorway states with interaction and without interaction. Using a random matrix\nmodel, we calculate the latter distribution exactly for regular and chaotic\nbackground states in the cases of preserved and fully broken time--reversal\ninvariance.

In scenarios\ndescribing the distribution of dust and stars in individual disk galaxies, the\namplitude of the extinction can be modulated by the inclination of the\ngalaxies. In this work we investigate the inclination dependency in composite\nspectra of star-forming disk galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease 5. In a volume-limited sample within a redshift range 0.065-0.075 and a\nr-band Petrosian absolute magnitude range -19.5 to -22 which exhibits a flat\ndistribution of inclination, the inclined relative to face-on extinction in the\nstellar continuum is found empirically to increase with inclination in the g,\nr, and i bands. Within the central 0.5 intrinsic half-light radius of the\ngalaxies, the g-band relative extinction in the stellar continuum for the\nhighly-inclined objects (axis ratio b/a = 0.1) is 1.2 mag, agreeing with\nprevious studies. The extinction curve of the disk galaxies is given in the\nrestframe wavelengths 3700-8000 angstrom, identified with major optical\nemission and absorption lines in diagnostics. The Balmer decrement remains\nconstant with inclination, suggesting a different kind of dust configuration\nand/or reddening mechanism in the HII region from that in the stellar\ncontinuum. One factor is shown to be the presence of spatially non-uniform\ninterstellar extinction, presumably caused by clumped dust in the vicinity of\nthe HII region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2010 13:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
