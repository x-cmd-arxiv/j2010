We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in\nobserved galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass\nestimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology\nand uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used\nto link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis\nresults in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0\nto z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z < 1. The largest\nuncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however,\nfailure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to\nerrors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in\nmassive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the\nshape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when\nuncertainties are taken into account.

We describe a procedure for identifying locations in\nkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,\nand apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering\nthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32.

Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB\nwithin the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few\nhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii. One\nstar has weaker atomic absorption lines than the others, such that [M/H] is 0.2\ndex lower. Such a difference in metallicity is consistent with the metallicity\ndispersion inferred from the width of the AGB in M32.

Most work has been done for random jammed packings\nof spheres, and it is only recently that corresponding packings of nonspherical\nparticles (e.g., ellipsoids) have received attention. Here we report a study of\nthe maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings of binary superdisks and\nmonodispersed superballs whose shapes are defined by |x_1|^2p+...+|x_2|^2p<=1\nwith d = 2 and 3, respectively, where p is the deformation parameter with\nvalues in the interval (0, infinity). We find that the MRJ densities of such\npackings increase dramatically and nonanalytically as one moves away from the\ncircular-disk and sphere point. Moreover, the disordered packings are\nhypostatic and the local arrangements of particles are necessarily nontrivially\ncorrelated to achieve jamming. We term such correlated structures \"nongeneric\".\nThe degree of \"nongenericity\" of the packings is quantitatively characterized\nby determining the fraction of local coordination structures in which the\ncentral particles have fewer contacting neighbors than average. We also show\nthat such seemingly special packing configurations are counterintuitively not\nrare. As the anisotropy of the particles increases, the fraction of rattlers\ndecreases while the minimal orientational order increases. These novel\ncharacteristics result from the unique rotational symmetry breaking manner of\nthe particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 01:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This paper presents a generic Dance Video Semantics Model\n(DVSM) in order to represent the semantics of the dance videos at different\ngranularity levels, identified by the components of the accompanying song. This\nmodel incorporates both syntactic and semantic features of the videos and\nintroduces a new entity type called, Agent, to specify the micro features of\nthe dance videos. The instantiations of the model are expressed as graphs. The\nmodel is implemented as a tool using J2SE and JMF to annotate the macro and\nmicro features of the dance videos. Finally examples and evaluation results are\nprovided to depict the effectiveness of the proposed dance video model.\nKeywords: Agents, Dance videos, Macro features, Micro features, Video\nannotation, Video semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 05:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

The contributions of the QSO and the host are\nseparated thanks to the MCS deconvolution algorithm, allowing a morphological\nclassification of the host, and the computation of several parameters such as\nthe host and nucleus absolute V-magnitude, distance between the luminosity\ncenter of the host and the QSO, and colour of the host and nucleus. We define a\nnew asymmetry coefficient, independent of any galaxy models and well suited for\nQSO host studies. The main results from this study are: (i) 25% of the total\nnumber of QSO hosts are spirals, 51% are ellipticals and 60% show signs of\ninteraction; (ii) Highly asymmetric systems tend to have a higher gas\nionization level (iii) Elliptical hosts contain a substantial amount of ionized\ngas, and some show off-nuclear activity.

Here we present the results of a collision model, which\nis based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the\nmaximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in\nprotoplanetary disks. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU at the\nmidplane at three different gas densities.

Furthermore\nwe see long lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the\naggregates due to bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity change\nupon varying the turbulence parameter and by varying the critical mass ratio of\ndust particles. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10^-4 during the\nsimulations. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than\nfragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is\nrather insensitive to the variations of the gas density and the strength of\nturbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to approximately 1\ngram (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed via the\nturbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted chondrule-sized\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2010 12:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We first formulate a recipe which determines the Bloch\nstates of a one-dimensional (1D) ring from the Bloch states of an infinite 1D\ncrystal created by the periodic repetition of the ring. Using the recipe, we\nderive an expression for the persistent current in a 1D ring made of an\ninsulator with an arbitrary valence band E(k). To find an exact result for a\nspecific insulator, we consider a 1D ring represented by a periodic lattice of\nN identical sites with a single value of the on-site energy. If the Bloch\nstates in the ring are expanded over a complete set of N on-site Wannier\nfunctions, the discrete on-site energy splits into the energy band. At full\nfilling, the band emulates the valence band of the band insulator and the ring\nis insulating. It carries a persistent current equal to the product of N and\nthe derivative of the on-site energy with respect to the magnetic flux. This\ncurrent is not zero if one takes into account that the on-site Wannier function\nand consequently the on-site energy of each ring site depend on magnetic flux.\nTo derive the current analytically, we expand all N Wannier functions of the\nring over the infinite basis of Wannier functions of the constituting infinite\n1D crystal and eventually determine the crystal Wannier functions by a method\nof localized atomic orbitals. Finally, we estimate the persistent current at\nfull filling in rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs).

This dust is in many respects expected to be similar to the\nzodiacal dust in the solar system. The ring displays a clear brightness\nasymmetry, attributed to asymmetric scattering of the central starlight by the\ncircumstellar dust grains. Recent measurements show that the bright side of the\nFomalhaut ring is oriented away from us. This implies that the grains in this\nsystem scatter most of the light in the backward direction, in sharp contrast\nto the forward-scattering nature of the grains in the solar system. In this\nletter, we show that grains considerably larger than those dominating the solar\nsystem zodiacal dust cloud provide a natural explanation for the apparent\nbackward scattering behavior. In fact, we see the phases of the dust grains in\nthe same way as we can observe the phases of the Moon and other large solar\nsystem bodies. We outline how the theory of the scattering behavior of\nplanetesimals can be used to explain the Fomalhaut dust properties. This\nindicates that the Fomalhaut dust ring is dominated by very large grains.
