Schemata extend\npropositional logic with indexed propositions, e.g. P_i, P_i+1, P_1, and with\ngeneralized connectives, e.g. /\\i=1..n or i=1..n (called \"iterations\") where n\nis an (unbound) integer variable called a \"parameter\".

We define a proof procedure, called DPLL*,\nthat can prove that a schema is satisfiable for at least one value of its\nparameter, in the spirit of the DPLL procedure. However the converse problem,\ni.e. proving that a schema is unsatisfiable for every value of the parameter,\nis undecidable so DPLL* does not terminate in general. Still, we prove that it\nterminates for schemata of a syntactic subclass called \"regularly nested\". This\nis the first non trivial class for which DPLL* is proved to terminate.\nFurthermore the class of regularly nested schemata is the first decidable class\nto allow nesting of iterations, i.e. to allow schemata of the form /\\i=1..n\n(/\\j=1..n ...).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2010 16:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

The category of commutative hyperring\nextensions of K is inclusive of: commutative algebras over fields with\nsemi-linear homomorphisms, abelian groups with injective homomorphisms and a\nrather exotic land comprising homogeneous non-Desarguesian planes. Finally, we\nshow that for a global field of positive characteristic, the groupoid of the\nprime elements of the hyperring H is canonically and equivariantly isomorphic\nto the groupoid of the loops of the maximal abelian cover of the curve\nassociated to the global field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2010 17:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2010 20:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-07"}

The surrender charge of a life annuity is a proportion\nof its value. Ruin occurs when the total of the value of the risky and riskless\nassets and the surrender value of the life annuity reaches zero. We find the\noptimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender\nstrategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is\nallowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the life annuity\nkeeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets\nis required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has\nthe flexiblity to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not\nbuy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and\nshe will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders\njust enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this\nsecond case, the individual's annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size\nof the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the\nindividual will not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her\nconsumption, the so-called safe level. When the charge is small enough, the\nindividual will buy a life annuity at a wealth lower than this safe level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2010 19:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

We first assemble a high quality database\nof ages and metallicities for 93 Milky Way GCs from literature deep\ncolour-magnitude data. The age-metallicity relation for the Milky Way's GCs\nreveals two distinct tracks -- one with near constant old age of ~12.8 Gyr and\nthe other branches to younger ages. We find that the latter young track is\ndominated by globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius and Canis Major\ndwarf galaxies. Despite being overly simplistic, its age-metallicity relation\ncan be well represented by a simple closed box model with continuous star\nformation. The inferred chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud. After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs,\nseveral young track GCs remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often\nred and hence classified as Young Halo objects, however they do not tend to\nreveal extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted\nremnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion) are\ncommonly found in the young track.

Here we\ndescribe a new system capable of tracking the position and body orientation of\nanimals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 msec\nlatency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these\nresults, a multi target tracking algorithm was developed based on the Extended\nKalman Filter and the Nearest Neighbor Standard Filter data association\nalgorithm. In one implementation, an eleven camera system is capable of\ntracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit\nnetwork of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This\nmanuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and\nshows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using\nthe tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight\nspeed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and\nfaster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful\ntool to study the neurobiology and behavior of freely flying animals.

Our first results give (-0.2 $\\pm$ 2.8) $\\times$\n10$^{-13}$ rad/pass, at 2.3 T with 18,700 passes through a 0.6 m long magnet,\nfor vacuum dichroism measurement. We are upgrading our interferometer to 7 m\narm-length with a new 1.8 m 2.3 T permanent magnet capable of rotation up to 13\ncycles per second. We aim at 10 nrad/Hz$^{1/2}$ optical sensitivity with 532 nm\ncavity finesse around 100,000. When achieved, vacuum dichroism would be\nmeasured to 8.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-17}$ rad/pass in about 50 days, and QED\nbirefringence would be measured to 28 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 06:30:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2010 09:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-27"}

The solution to\nthis equation is found through a wave packet approach which establishes a\ndirect correlation between a classical variable with a quantum variable\ndescribing the dynamics of the center of mass and the width of the wave packet.\nThe approach presented in this paper gives a comparatively clearer picture than\napproaches using restrited path integrals and master equation approaches. This\nwork shows how the extremely irregular character of classical chaos can be\nreconciled with the smooth and wavelike nature of phenomena on the atomic\nscale. It is demonstrated that a wave packet under continuous quantum\nmeasurement displays both chaotic and non-chaotic features. The Lyapunov\ncharacteristic exponents for the trajectories of classical particle and the\nquantum wave packet center of mass are calculated and their chaoticities are\ndemonstrated to be about the same. Nonetheless, the width of the wave packet\nexhibits a non-chaotic behavior and allows for the possibility to beat the\nstandard quantum limit by means of transient, contractive states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 07:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

Our results indicate that the coupling between magnetic\nordering and structural distortion is very similar in AFe2As2 and RFeAsO type\nof compounds, much more similar than previously thought. The implications of\nour experimental results give arguments both in favor and against the nematic\nphase model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 09:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2010 14:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 May 2010 09:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-06"}

This method, developed originally for phase\ntransformations, has the well-known advantage of avoiding explicit front\ntracking by making material interfaces spatially diffuse. In a fracture\ncontext, this method is able to capture both the short-scale physics of failure\nand macroscopic linear elasticity within a self-consistent set of equations\nthat can be simulated on experimentally relevant length and time scales.

We aim at studying some possible\nphysical mechanisms contributing to the MZ relation by adopting analytical\nsolutions of chemical evolution models including infall and outflow. We explore\nthe hypotheses of a variable galactic wind rate, infall rate and yield per\nstellar generation (i.e. a variation in the IMF), as possible causes for the MZ\nrelation. By means of analytical models we compute the expected O abundance for\ngalaxies of a given total baryonic mass and gas mass.The stellar mass is\nderived observationally and the gas mass is derived by inverting the Kennicutt\nlaw of star formation, once the star formation rate is known. Then we test how\nthe parameters describing the outflow, infall and IMF should vary to reproduce\nthe MZ relation, and we exclude the cases where such a variation leads to\nunrealistic situations. We find that a galactic wind rate increasing with\ndecreasing galactic mass or a variable IMF are both viable solutions for the MZ\nrelation. A variable infall rate instead is not acceptable. It is difficult to\ndisentangle among the outflow and IMF solutions only by considering the MZ\nrelation, and other observational constraints should be taken into account to\nselect a specific solution. For example, a variable efficiency of star\nformation increasing with galactic mass can also reproduce the MZ relation and\nexplain the downsizing in star formation suggested for ellipticals. The best\nsolution could be a variable efficiency of star formation coupled with galactic\nwinds, which are indeed observed in low mass galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 10:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

The\nd/sdL7 is blue in J-H and H-K and has other features suggestive of\nlow-metallicity and/or high gravity. The T7.5p displays spectral peculiarity\nseen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in UKIDSS LAS DR4, and referred\nto as CH4-J-early peculiarity. We suggest that CH4-J-early peculiarity arises\nfrom low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use for\nclassifying T dwarfs. UKIDSS and follow-up UKIRT/WFCAM photometry shows the T\ndwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object with\nH-K = -1.31+/-0.17. Warm Spitzer IRAC photometry shows the T dwarf to have\nextremely red H-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for a\nsubstellar object. The lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits our\nability to estimate parameters for the system. However, applying a conservative\ndistance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135\nAU. By comparing H-K:H-[4.5] colours of the T dwarf to spectral models we\nestimate that Teff = 500 K and [M/H]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. This suggests a\nmass of ~30 MJupiter for the T dwarf and an age of ~10 Gyr for the system. The\nprimary would then be a 75MJupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relatively\ndust-free Teff ~ 1500K atmosphere. Given the unusual properties of the system\nwe caution that these estimates are uncertain.

The evolution in the mean count rates shows that the time behaviour of\nboth the leading trail and the baseline level are very similar to those\nobserved in the 1.6--3 and 15--100 keV ranges, while that of the pulse follows\nthe peak number.

We consider two classes of\nbounded domains that satisfy mild boundary conditions and that become \"simple\"\nafter a finite number of disjoint cuts along properly embedded surfaces. For\nthe first class (Helmholtz), \"simple\" means that every curl-free smooth vector\nfield admits a potential. For the second (weakly-Helmholtz), we only require\nthat a potential exists for the restriction of every curl-free smooth vector\nfield defined on the whole initial domain. By means of classical and rather\nelementary facts of 3-dimensional geometric and algebraic topology, we give an\nexhaustive description of Helmholtz domains, realizing that their topology is\nforced to be quite elementary (in particular, Helmholtz domains with connected\nboundary are just possibly knotted handlebodies, and the complement of any\nnon-trivial link is not Helmholtz).

In this game the player is given an n by n board of tiles where each\ntile is allocated one of c colours. The goal is to make the colours of all\ntiles equal via the shortest possible sequence of flooding operations. In the\nstandard version, a flooding operation consists of the player choosing a colour\nk, which then changes the colour of all the tiles in the monochromatic region\nconnected to the top left tile to k. After this operation has been performed,\nneighbouring regions which are already of the chosen colour k will then also\nbecome connected, thereby extending the monochromatic region of the board. We\nshow that finding the minimum number of flooding operations is NP-hard for c>=3\nand that this even holds when the player can perform flooding operations from\nany position on the board. However, we show that this \"free\" variant is in P\nfor c=2. We also prove that for an unbounded number of colours, Flood-It\nremains NP-hard for boards of height at least 3, but is in P for boards of\nheight 2. Next we show how a c-1 approximation and a randomised 2c/3\napproximation algorithm can be derived, and that no polynomial time constant\nfactor, independent of c, approximation algorithm exists unless P=NP. We then\ninvestigate how many moves are required for the \"most demanding\" n by n boards\n(those requiring the most moves) and show that the number grows as fast as\nTheta(n*c^0.5). Finally, we consider boards where the colours of the tiles are\nchosen at random and show that for c>=2, the number of moves required to flood\nthe whole board is Omega(n) with high probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 13:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 16:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}

This model,\nknown as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of\nwireless medium and interference. Avestimehr et al. showed that the Min-cut\nMax-flow theorem holds in the ADT network.\n  In this paper, we show that the ADT network model can be described within the\nalgebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove\nthat the ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, called the\n\"system matrix\". We show that the min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of the\nsystem matrix; thus, eliminating the need to optimize over exponential number\nof cuts between two nodes to compute the min-cut of an ADT network.\n  We extend the capacity characterization for ADT networks to a more general\nset of connections.

Many of these modulations are nearly periodic. In RR Lyrae\nstars the phenomenon in known as the Blazhko Effect. Because of the observed\nsimilarities, we propose to extend the definition to other groups. We\nillustrate the Blazhko Effect with examples from Cepheids, RR Lyrae stars,\nWhite Dwarfs, sdB stars and delta Scuti variables. For delta Scuti stars the\npresent results indicate the presence of at least two effects: beating of\nindependent modes with close frequencies and stellar cycles. For period and\namplitude changes with timescales less than one year, the beating hypothesis\nexplains the observed modulations very well. This has been shown by the\ncorrectly correlated relationship between amplitude and phase changes as well\nas the repetitions of these cycles. However, the observed period variations\nwith longer timescales cannot be due to simple beating between two close\nfrequencies. For the star AI CVn (= 4 CVn), we can derive accurate annual\nfrequency values for a number of radial and nonradial modes from 1974 to 2009.\nFor prograde and retrograde modes, the frequency variations are of similar\nsize, but with opposite signs. The radial mode shows no (or little) changes.\nFur- thermore, all frequency variations show a reversal around 1990. These\nresults are consistent with long-term cycles affecting individual modes\ndifferently with some common systematic behavior. The observed change in the\nsize of rotational splitting is interpreted as a change in the differential\nrotation during the stellar cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 14:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

Twin matter is\nhypothetical matter that might couple directly only to the second metric of the\ntheory. Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens. Strong lensing occurs in the high acceleration regime, and\nthus depends on the value of beta. For beta=1 no strong lensing effects of TM\nare expected. I also discuss briefly asymmetric theories (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 14:55:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 16:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2010 15:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-17"}

The\napproach we take to increase customer privacy is a radical departure from the\nmainstream research efforts that focus on implementing privacy enhancing\ntechnologies on the RFID tags themselves. Instead the Privacy Coach functions\nas a mediator between customer privacy preferences and corporate privacy\npolicies, trying to find a match between the two, and informing the user of the\noutcome. In this paper we report on the architecture of the Privacy Coach, and\nshow how it enables users to make informed privacy decisions in a user-friendly\nmanner. We also spend considerable time to discuss lessons learnt and to\ndescribe future plans to further improve on the Privacy Coach concept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 15:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

It says that a symmetric real polynomial $F$ of degree\n$d$ in $n$ variables is positive on $\\R^n$ (on $\\R^{n}_{\\geq 0}$) if and only\nif it is so on the subset of points with at most $\\max\\{\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor,2\\}$\ndistinct components. We deduce Timofte's original statement as a corollary of a\nslightly more general statement on symmetric optimization problems. The idea we\nare using to prove this statement is to relate it to a linear optimization\nproblem in the orbit space. The fact that for the case of the symmetric group\n$S_n$ this can be viewed as a question on normalized univariate real\npolynomials with only real roots allows us to conclude the theorems in a very\nelementary way. We hope that the methods presented here will make it possible\nto derive similar statements also in the case of other groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 15:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 07:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-22"}

We obtain surface brightness distributions from EPIC-pn data\nobtained with XMM-Newton, compare the profiles of different sources, and fit\nthem with a model based on the standard theory of X-ray scattering by dust\ngrains, both for a uniform distribution of dust along the line of sight, and\nfor dust distributions constrained by previous measurements. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, we find that for all three sources, the uniform distribution\nreproduces the observed surface brightness as well as or better than the\ndistributions that are informed by previous constraints. Nevertheless, the\ninferred total dust columns are robust, and serve to confirm that previous\nmeasurements based on interstellar edges in high-resolution X-ray spectra and\non modelling of broad-band X-ray spectra were reliable.
