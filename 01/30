The main role of\nthe BH-disc magnetic connection is to provide the source of energy for the jets\nwhen the mass accretion rate is very low. We assume that the jets are launched\nfrom the disc inside the BH ergosphere, where the rotational effects of the\nspace-time become much stronger, being further accelerated by magnetic\nprocesses. The rotation of the space-time channels a fraction of the disc\nenergy (i.e., the gravitational energy of the disc plus the rotational energy\nof the BH which is deposited into the disc by magnetic connection) into a\npopulation of particles that escape from the disc surfaces, carrying away mass,\nenergy and angular momentum in the form of jets, allowing the remaining disc\ngas to accrete. In the limit of the spin-down power regime, the model proposed\nhere can be regarded as a variant of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, where the\nBH rotational energy is transferred to the disc inside the ergosphere and then\nused to drive the jets. We use general-relativistic conservation laws to\ncalculate the mass flow rate into the jets, the launching power of the jets and\nthe angular momentum transported by the jets for BHs with a spin parameter $a_*\n\\geqslant 0.95$.

Consequently, the properties\nof MBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies may provide clean indicators of the efficiency\nof MBH formation. In order to examine the properties of MBHs in dwarf galaxies,\nwe evolve different MBH populations within a Milky Way halo from high-redshift\nto today. We consider two plausible MBH formation mechanisms: `massive seeds'\nformed via gas-dynamical instabilities and a Population III remnant seed model.\n`Massive seeds' have larger masses than PopIII remnants, but form in rarer\nhosts. We dynamically evolve all halos merging with the central system, taking\ninto consideration how the interaction modifies the satellites, stripping their\nouter mass layers. We compute different properties of the MBH population hosted\nin these satellites.

In this paper, through numerical study of a 2D LJ\namorphous solid, we generalize the study of the heterogeneous dynamics of\nglassy materials to the finite shear-rate and temperature case. The global\nmechanical response obtained through the use of Molecular Dynamics is shown to\nconverge to the quasistatic limit obtained with an energy minimization\nprotocol. The detailed analysis of the plastic deformation at different shear\nrates shows that the glass follows different flow regimes. At sufficiently low\nshear rates the mechanical response reaches a shear-rate independent regime\nthat exhibits all the characteristics of the quasistatic response (finite size\neffects, yield stress...).

A particular case is the degree\nfiltration used in the definition of the growth of finitely generated algebras.\nThe notion of tame filtration is useful in the study of possible distortion of\ndegrees of elements when one algebra is embedded as a subalgebra in another. A\ngeometric analogue is the distortion of the (Riemannian) metric of a (Lie)\nsubgroup when compared to the metric induced from the ambient (Lie) group. The\ndistortion of a subalgebra in an algebra also reflects the degree of complexity\nof the membership problem for the elements of this algebra in this subalgebra.\nOne of our goals here is to investigate, mostly in the case of associative or\nLie algebras, if a tame filtration of an algebra can be induced from the degree\nfiltration of a larger algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 21:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 19:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-24"}

The\nULIRGs are on average 1 magnitude brighter in M0.1r than the SDSS galaxies\nwithin the same redshift range. The majority of the ULIRGs (~87%) have the\ncolors typical of the blue cloud, and only 4 sources (~7%) are located in the\nred sequence. While ULIRGs are popularly thought to be precursors to a QSO\nphase, we find few (~6%) in the \"green valley\" where the majority of the X-ray\nand IR selected AGNs are found, and none of which harbors an AGN. For the 14\npreviously spectroscopic identified AGNs (~28%), we perform PSF subtractions\nand find that on average the central point sources contribute less than one\nthird to the total luminosity, and that their high optical luminosities and\noverall blue colors are apparently the result of star formation activity of the\nhost galaxies. Visual inspection of the SDSS images reveals a wide range of\ndisturbed morphologies. A detailed morphology analysis using Gini and M20\ncoefficients shows that slightly less than one half (~42% in g band) of the\nULIRGs are located in the region where most local mergers are found. The\nheterogeneous distribution of ULIRGs in the G-M20 space is qualitatively\nconsistent with the results found by numerical simulations of disk-disk\nmergers. Our study also shows that the measured morphological parameters are\nsystematically affected by the SNR and thus the merging galaxies can appear at\nvarious regions in the G-M20 space. In general, our results reinforce the view\nthat ULIRGs contain young stellar populations and are mergers in progress. Our\nstudy provides a uniform comparison sample for studying ULIRGs at higher\nredshifts such as Spitzer mid-IR selected ULIRGs at z=1~2 and submm galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 21:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The surface abundance distributions of Fe and Cr and a full vector map of\nthe stellar magnetic field are reconstructed in a self-consistent inversion\nusing our state-of-the-art magnetic Doppler imaging code Invers10.

Our magnetic Doppler\nimaging analysis of alpha^2 CVn and previous results for 53 Cam support the\nview that the upper main sequence stars can harbour fairly complex surface\nmagnetic fields which resemble oblique dipoles only at the largest spatial\nscales.

We then discuss how far present sprite and streamer theory has been\ndeveloped, and we show how streamer experiments can be interpreted as sprite\nsimulations.

The total X-ray sample of 895 sources with median redshift z~1 is\ndetected at a mean submm flux of 0.49+-0.04mJy, corresponding to a typical star\nformation rate around 30Msun/yr for a T=35K, beta=1.5 greybody far-infrared\nSED.

Increasing trends with X-ray obscuration as expected in some\nAGN evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the X-ray AGN\nsample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects. This\nsuggests a transition between two modes in the coexistence of AGN activity and\nstar formation. For the bulk of the sample, the X-ray luminosity and\nobscuration of the AGN are not intimately linked to the global star formation\nrate of their hosts. The hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly,\nat rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxies\nwithout an AGN at similar redshifts. The change indicated towards more intense\nstar formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates between\nunobscured and obscured AGN at highest luminosities suggests that luminous AGN\nfollow an evolutionary path on which obscured AGN activity and intense star\nformation are linked, possibly via merging.

As a result, the value of the ionic density in the normal\ndirection and near to the surface shows some oscillations around the bulk\nvalue. To describe this behavior in a simple way, we have formulated the\nself-compressed inhomogeneous stabilized jellium model and have applied it to\nsimple metal thin films. In this model, for a $\\nu$-layered slab, each ionic\nlayer is replaced by a jellium slice of constant density. The equilibrium\ndensities of the slices can be determined by minimizing the total energy per\nelectron of the slab with respect to the slice densities. To avoid the\ncomplications that arise due to the number of independent slice-density\nparameters for large-$\\nu$ slabs, we consider a simplified version of the model\nwith three jellium slices: one inner bulk slice with density $\\bar n_1$ and two\nsimilar surface slices of densities $\\bar n_2$. In this simplified model, each\nslice may contain more than one ionic layer.
