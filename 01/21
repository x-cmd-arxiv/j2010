This widely used approximation assumes that the mass\nfunction can be expressed as a function of the matter density omega_m and the\nrms linear density fluctuation sigma only, with no explicit dependence on the\nproperties of dark energy or redshift. In order to test this hypothesis we run\na series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological\nmodels. These consists of three LCDM cosmologies best fitting WMAP-1, 3 and 5\nyears data, and three toy-models characterized by a Ratra-Peebles quintessence\npotential with different slopes and amounts of dark energy density. These toy\nmodels have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear\nlevel, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the\nmass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the\nFriend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a\nuniversal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic\norigin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated\ncosmologies. Using the spherical collapse as guidance, we show that such\ndeviations are caused by the cosmology dependence of the non-linear collapse\nand virialization process. For practical applications, we provide a fitting\nformula of the mass function accurate to 5 percents over the all range of\ninvestigated cosmologies. We also derive an empirical relation between the FoF\nlinking parameter and the virial overdensity which can account for most of the\ndeviations from an exact universal behavior. Overall these results suggest that\nthe halo mass function contains unique cosmological information since it\ncarries a fossil record of the past cosmic evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 17:51:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 11:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Because of the very low proper motion of the cluster, late-type dwarfs\nwith appreciable proper motion in the foreground of sigma Orionis can be easily\ndiscarded for expensive spectroscopic follow-up. Methods: I use the Aladin sky\natlas, USNO-B1, public astrometric catalogues, and photographic plate\ndigitisations to identify stars with proper motions inconsistent with cluster\nmembership in a circular area of radius 30 arcmin centred on the early-type\nmultiple system sigma Ori.

We visualized the co-authoring\nnetworks and measured their properties over time at three levels: author,\ninstitution, and country levels. We compared these measurements to a random\nnetwork model and also compared results across the three levels. The study\nfound that 1) the collaboration networks of the SDSS community transformed from\nrandom networks to small-world networks; 2) the number of author-level\ncollaboration instances has not changed much over time, while the number of\ncollaboration instances at the other two levels has increased over time; 3)\npairwise institutional collaboration become common in recent years. The open\ndata trend may have both positive and negative impacts on scientific\ncollaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 20:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-21"}

We present some of the properties of these peaks, which fall into\na well behaved pattern at large n, extracting the scaling of Fermi energy with\nn and H, as well as the dispersion of the quasiparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 23:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 20:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We assume that the slowly varying configurational subsystem, i.e.\nthe part of the system that is described by inherent structures, is\ncharacterized by an effective temperature, and contains a volume-related\ninternal variable. We examine mechanisms by which irreversible dynamics of the\nfast, kinetic-vibrational degrees of freedom can cause the entropy and the\neffective temperature of the configurational subsystem to increase during\nsufficiently rapid changes in the bath temperature. We then use this theory to\ninterpret the numerical simulations by Mossa and Sciortino (MS), who observe\nthe Kovacs effect in more detail than is feasible in laboratory experiments.\nOur analysis highlights two mechanisms for the equilibration of internal\nvariables. In one of these, an internal variable first relaxes toward a state\nof quasi-equilibrium determined by the effective temperature, and then\napproaches true thermodynamic equilibrium as the effective temperature slowly\nrelaxes toward the bath temperature. In the other mechanism, an internal\nvariable directly equilibrates with the bath temperature on intermediate\ntimescales, without equilibrating with the effective temperature at any stage.\nBoth mechanisms appear to be essential for understanding the MS results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 23:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Flash memory has\nmany access characteristics different from those of magnetic disks, and how to\ntake advantage of them is becoming an important research issue. There are two\nexisting approaches to storing data into flash memory: page-based and\nlog-based. The former has good performance for read operations, but poor\nperformance for write operations. In contrast, the latter has good performance\nfor write operations when updates are light, but poor performance for read\noperations. In this paper, we propose a new method of storing data, called\npage-differential logging, for flash-based storage systems that solves the\ndrawbacks of the two methods. The primary characteristics of our method are:\n(1) writing only the difference (which we define as the page-differential)\nbetween the original page in flash memory and the up-to-date page in memory;\n(2) computing and writing the page-differential only once at the time the page\nneeds to be reflected into flash memory. The former contrasts with existing\npage-based methods that write the whole page including both changed and\nunchanged parts of data or from log-based ones that keep track of the history\nof all the changes in a page.

At each step, with equal probability, either we\npick a ball at random in $A$ and place it in $B$, or vice-versa (provided of\ncourse that $A$, or $B$, is not empty). The number of balls in $B$ after $n$\nsteps is of order $\\sqrt n$, and this number remains essentially the same after\n$\\sqrt n$ further steps. Observe that each ball in the urn $B$ after $n$ steps\nhas a probability bounded away from $0$ and $1$ to be placed back in the urn\n$A$ after $\\sqrt n$ further steps. So, even though the number of balls in $B$\ndoes not evolve significantly between $n$ and $n+\\sqrt n$, the precise contain\nof urn $B$ does.

The goal is\nto allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the\nnetwork at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed\nby a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The\nstorage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly\ncombine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized\nstrategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded\npackets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be\nsufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing\ndecoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set.\nWhenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is\npolled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of\nthe decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a\nprediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets\ncan be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree\ndistribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection\ndelay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the\nexpense of a larger collection delay. Not surprisingly, a circular network\nallows for a significantly more (analytically and otherwise) tractable\nstrategies relative to a network whose model is a random geometric graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 10:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Two contrary explanations for this effect are given in literature:\nFirst, confinement induced acceleration of the dynamics of the molecules leads\nto an effective downshift of T-g increasing with decreasing pore size. Second,\ndue to thermal mismatch between the liquid and the surrounding host matrix,\nnegative pressure develops inside the pores with decreasing temperature, which\nalso shifts T-g to lower temperatures. Here we present dynamic mechanical\nanalysis measurements of the glass forming liquid salol in Vycor and Gelsil\nwith pore sizes of d=2.6, 5.0 and 7.5 nm. The dynamic complex elastic\nsusceptibility data can be consistently described with the assumption of two\nrelaxation processes inside the pores: A surface induced slowed down relaxation\ndue to interaction with rough pore interfaces and a second relaxation within\nthe core of the pores. This core relaxation time is reduced with decreasing\npore size d, leading to a downshift of T-g proportional to 1/d in perfect\nagreement with recent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements.\nThermal expansion measurements of empty and salol filled mesoporous samples\nrevealed that the contribution of negative pressure to the downshift of T-g is\nsmall (<30%) and the main effect is due to the suppression of dynamically\ncorrelated regions of size xi when the pore size xi approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 10:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}

As the functional\nprograms are super-level programs that entails requirements only at functional\nlevel, decoding of functions and distribution of functions in the heterogeneous\nfunctional processor units are a challenge. We explored the possibilities of\nsegregation of the functions from the application program and distributing the\nfunctions on the relevant FPUs by using address mapping techniques.

The transmitter is assumed to\ncomprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes\nthe front-end imposed transmit energy penalty. Focusing on discrete complex\ninput alphabets, the energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet\nto a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. For the common discrete\nlattice-based relaxation, the problem is found to violate the assumption of\nreplica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking ansatz is taken. The limiting\nempirical distribution of the precoder's output, as well as the limiting energy\npenalty, are derived for one-step replica symmetry breaking. For convex\nrelaxations, replica symmetry is found to hold and corresponding results are\nobtained for comparison. Particularizing to a \"zero-forcing\" (ZF) linear\nfront-end, and non-cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according\nto which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be\neffectively characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u, x, and y are the\nchannel input, the equivalent precoder output, and the channel output,\nrespectively. For discrete lattice-based alphabet relaxation, the impact of\nreplica symmetry breaking is demonstrated for the energy penalty at the\ntransmitter. An analysis of spectral efficiency is provided to compare discrete\nlattice-based relaxations against convex relaxations, as well as linear ZF and\nTomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying\n(QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations\nare revealed compared to linear ZF precoding, for medium to high\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

As an additional attractive option we consider the\ngeneration of powerful soft x-ray and VUV radiation by the same electron bunch\nfor pump-probe experiments, making use of recently invented compact afterburner\nscheme. We also propose a betatron switcher as a simple, cheap, and robust\nsolution for multi-color operation of SASE1 and SASE2 undulators, allowing to\ngenerate 2 to 5 x-ray beams of different independent colors from each of these\nundulators for simultaneous multi-user operation. We describe a scheme for\npump-probe experiments, based on a production of two different colors by two\nclosely spaced electron bunches (produced in photoinjector) with the help of a\nvery fast betatron switcher. Finally, we discuss how without significant\nmodifications of the layout the European XFEL can become a unique facility that\ncontinuously covers with powerful, coherent radiation a part of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum from far infrared to gamma-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 14:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Unfortunately, tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria\nhave proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing\nor duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T\nor D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the\ntRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this\nissue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of\nfinding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the\nARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce\ncomplementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of\nerroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed\ngenes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent\ncriteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of\nthese. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to\ninconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are\napparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to\nhave support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic\nlocations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have\nmitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not\nrRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs\nlacking both the D and T arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 14:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 13:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-06"}

One\ndistinguished property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends\nquasi-quadratically on the degree of the finite base field. Our algorithm is a\nmodified version of an earlier method that was developed in joint work with\nLubicz. We explain how one can alter the original algorithm, on the basis of\nnew theory, such that it can be used to efficiently count points on genus two\ncurves over large finite fields. Examples of cryptographic size have been\ncomputed using an experimental Magma implementation of the algorithm which has\nbeen programmed by the author.

All of these yield a\npower-law steady state. We derive, for the first time, the eigenvalue spectrum\nfor the linearised evolution operator, under certain constraints on the\nparameters. This provides new knowledge of the stability properties of the\npower-law steady state.

In the classical case, the conditional\nexpectations always exist; in the quantum case, however, they exist only if a\ncertain weak compatibility criterion is satisfied. This compatibility criterion\nwas introduced among others in a recent paper by the author. Then,\nstate-independent conditional expectations and quantum Markov processes are\nstudied. A classical Markov process is a probability measure, together with a\nsystem of random variables, satisfying the Markov property and can equivalently\nbe described by a system of Markovian kernels (often forming a semigroup). This\nequivalence is partly extended to quantum probabilities. It is shown that a\ndynamical (semi)group can be derived from a given system of quantum observables\nsatisfying the Markov property, and the group generators are studied. The\nresults are presented in the framework of Jordan operator algebras, and a very\ngeneral type of observables (including the usual real-valued observables or\nself-adjoint operators) is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 15:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}
