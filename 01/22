For detection,\nwe use only the 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron IRAC bands, as these can still be\nused for multi-epoch Spitzer surveys of nearby galaxies (=<10 Mpc). We combine\nfamiliar PSF and aperture-photometry with an innovative application of image\nsubtraction to catalog the self-obscured massive stars in these galaxies. In\nparticular, we verify that stars analogous to the progenitors of the NGC 6946\n(SN 2008S) and NGC 300 transients are truly rare in all four galaxies: their\nnumber may be as low as ~1 per galaxy at any given moment.

To verify\nour initial detection, we obtained a deep (500 ks), follow-up exposure of\nH2356-309 as part of the Cycle-10 Chandra Large Project Program. From a joint\nanalysis of the Cycle-10 and previous (Cycle-8) Chandra grating data we detect\nthe redshifted OVII WHIM line at a significance level of 3.4-sigma, a\nsubstantial improvement over the 1.7-sigma level reported previously when using\nonly the Cycle-8 data. The significance increases to 4.0-sigma when the\nexisting XMM grating data are included in the analysis, thus confirming at\nhigher significance the existence of the line at the redshift of the Sculptor\nWall with an equivalent width of 28.5+/-10.5 mA (90% confidence). We obtain a\n90% lower limit on the OVII column density of 0.8 10^16 cm^-2 and a 90% upper\nlimit on the Doppler-b parameter of 460 km/s. Assuming the absorber is\nuniformly distributed throughout the ~ 15 Mpc portion of the blazar's\nsight-line that intercepts the Sculptor Wall, that the OVII column density is ~\n2 10^16 cm^-2 (corresponding to b > 150 km/s where the inferred column density\nis only weakly dependent on b), and that the oxygen abundance is 0.1 solar, we\nestimate a baryon over-density of ~ 30 for the WHIM, which is consistent with\nthe peak of the WHIM mass fraction predicted by cosmological simulations. The\nclear detection of OVII absorption in the Sculptor Wall demonstrates the\nviability of using current observatories to study WHIM in the X-ray absorption\nspectra of blazars behind known large-scale structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 19:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2010 21:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Therefore a different, universal\ndefinition of the Kondo energy is proposed, which uses the evasion of the\northogonality catastrophe by the Kondo impurity. In the absense of the Kondo\neffect the multi-electron scalar product (MESP) between all occupied spin-up\nand spin-down states approaches zero (the so-called orthogonality catastrophe).\nIn contrast in the Kondo ground state the corresponding conduction electrons of\nopposite spin are pairwise aligned within the Kondo energy. In the present\npaper the MESP is investigated for the FAIR solution of the Friedel-Anderson\nimpurity. The MESP is numerically determined for the (enforced) magnetic and\nthe singlet states as a function of the number N of Wilson states. The magnetic\nstates show an exponentially decreasing MESP as a function of N. In the singlet\nstate the ground state requires a finite MESP to optimize its energy. As a\nconsequence there is no orthogonality catastrophe. Within the energy range of\nthe Kondo energy the scalar product between corresponding (single electron)\nspin-up and spin-down states is very close to 1.000 and falls off beyond the\nKondo energy. The energy which separates the two regions is well suited as a\nuniversal definition of the Kondo energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 19:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}

It is\nfeared that the gas settles in a large scale disc, and that accretion would\nthen proceed too inefficiently to explain the masses of the observed SMBHs.\nHere we point out that, while the mean angular momentum in the bulge is very\nlikely to be large, the deviations from the mean can also be significant.\nIndeed, cosmological simulations show that velocity and angular momentum fields\nof gas flows onto galaxies are very complex. Furthermore, inside bulges the gas\nvelocity distribution can be further randomised by the velocity kicks due to\nfeedback from star formation. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of gaseous\nrotating shells infalling onto an SMBH, attempting to quantify the importance\nof velocity dispersion in the gas at relatively large distances from the black\nhole. We implement this dispersion by means of a supersonic turbulent velocity\nspectrum. We find that, while in the purely rotating case the circularisation\nprocess leads to efficient mixing of gas with different angular momentum,\nresulting in a low accretion rate, the inclusion of turbulence increases this\naccretion rate by up to several orders of magnitude. We show that this can be\nunderstood based on the notion of \"ballistic\" accretion, whereby dense\nfilaments, created by convergent turbulent flows, travel through the ambient\ngas largely unaffected by hydrodynamical drag. We derive a simple analytical\nformula that captures the numerical results to within a factor of a few.\nRescaling our results to astrophysical bulges, we argue that this \"ballistic\"\nmode of accretion could provide the SMBHs with a sufficient supply of fuel\nwithout the need to channel the gas via large-scale discs or bars, and\ntherefore that star formation in bulges can be a strong catalyst for SMBH\naccretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 21:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2011 14:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-01"}

Spin has played an essential role\nand often brought surprises and puzzles to the investigation of the nucleon\nstructure and the strong interaction. New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers. The validity of these theories\nis further examined as the momentum transfer increases to moderate values. It\nis found that chiral perturbation theory calculations agree reasonably well\nwith the first moment of the spin structure function g_1 at low momentum\ntransfer of 0.05 - 0.1 GeV^2 but fail to reproduce some of the higher moments,\nnoticeably, the neutron data in the case of the generalized polarizability\nDelta_LT.

The Y(3940) state is considered to be a superposition of\n$D^{\\ast +}D^{\\ast -}$ and $D^{\\ast 0} \\overline{D^{\\ast 0}}$, while the\nY(4140) is a bound state of $D_s^{\\ast +}$ and $D_s^{\\ast -}$ mesons.

The results for the strong hidden charm decay modes\nclearly support the molecular interpretation of the Y(3940) and Y(4140), while\nour estimates for the radiative decays provide a sensitive test for the\nunderlying meson structure of the two Y mesons discussed here.

Their existence cannot be explained by the\nprocess of star formation or by dynamical interactions in the field, and their\norigin has long been a mystery. We explain the origin of these wide binaries by\nformation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initially\nunbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase-space is\nsmall. Using N-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binary\nfraction in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1 pc for individual clusters\nis 1-30%, depending on the initial conditions. The existence of numerous wide\nbinaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that most\nclusters start out with a large degree of substructure. The wide binary\nfraction decreases strongly with increasing cluster mass, and the semi-major\naxis of the newly formed binaries is determined by the initial cluster size.\nThe resulting eccentricity distribution is thermal, and the mass ratio\ndistribution is consistent with gravitationally-focused random pairing. As a\nlarge fraction of the stars form in primordial binaries, we predict that a\nlarge number of the observed 'wide binaries' are in fact triple or quadruple\nsystems. By integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution, we predict\na binary fraction of a few per cent in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1\npc in the Galactic field, which is smaller than the observed wide binary\nfraction. However, this discrepancy may be solved when we consider a broad\nrange of cluster morphologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 12:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The estimation of quantum channels is of great importance to the\nfield of quantum information. In this thesis two topics related to estimation\nof quantum channels are investigated. The first of these is the upper bound of\nSarovar and Milburn (2006) on the Fisher information obtainable by measuring\nthe output of a channel. Two questions raised by Sarovar and Milburn about\ntheir bound are answered. A Riemannian metric on the space of quantum states is\nintroduced, related to the construction of the Sarovar and Milburn bound. Its\nproperties are characterized. The second topic investigated is the estimation\nof unitary channels. The situation is considered in which an experimenter has\nseveral non-identical unitary channels that have the same parameter. It is\nshown that it is possible to improve estimation using the channels together,\nanalogous to the case of identical unitary channels. Also, a new method of\nphase estimation is given based on a method sketched by Kitaev (1996). Unlike\nother phase estimation procedures which perform similarly, this procedure\nrequires only very basic experimental resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 12:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-25"}

A particular situation which favours the formation of exotic\nphases of the electron liquid in complex materials is that where a quantum\ncritical point (QCP) is present the phase diagram. Neighbouring regions in\nparameter space reveal unusual physical properties, described as non-Fermi\nliquid behaviour.\n  One of the important problems in quantum criticality is to find out how the\nFermi surface (FS) of a material evolves near a QCP. The traditional method for\nstudying the FS of materials is the de Haas van Alphen effect (dHvA). A quantum\ncritical end point (QCEP) has been reported in the highly correlated metal\nSr3Ru2O7, which is tuned using a magnetic field high enough to perform the dHvA\nexperiment. It moreover features a new emergent phase in the vicinity of the\nQCEP, a nematic type of electron ordering.\n  The subject of this thesis is the study of the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 using the dHvA\neffect. Three aspects were explored. The first was the determination of the FS\nat fields both above and below that where the QCEP arises. The second was the\nsearch for quantum oscillations inside the nematic phase. The third was a\nreinvestigation of the behaviour of the quasiparticle effective masses near the\nFS.\n  A complete robust model for the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 at zero fields was determined.\nMoreover, the new measurements of the quasiparticle masses revealed that no\nmass enhancements exist anywhere around the QCEP. Finally, we report dHvA\noscillations inside the nematic phase, which suggests that the carriers consist\nof Landau quasiparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 11:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-25"}

Based on this theory, the dielectric\nfunctions of mono- and multi-layer graphenes are deduced and compared with\nthose of terrestrial graphite. The resonance width of an ordered stack of\ngraphenes is found to increase with the number of layers while the central\nfrequency stays constant. This is the basis of the polycrystalline model of the\ncarrier of the 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction band. In this model, the\ncarrier dust grains derive from parent hydrocarbon grains. As a grain ages in\nthe IS medium, the light atoms are expelled, hexagonal carbon rings lump\ntogether into compact planar clusters, which then assemble into stacks of\nparallel, equidistant, graphene-like layers. This so-called graphitization is\nwell known to occur in the earth or under strong heating. As the number of\nlayers in each stack increases and their relative orientational order improves,\nthe pi resonance width increases asymptotically towards that of terrestrial\ngraphite. Because of the initial random structure of the parent grains, many\nrandomly oriented stacks may coexist in the same grain. Calculations of the\ndielectric response of this composite medium show that, for such a grain, the\nwidth of the extinction efficiency peak follows the same trend as the pi\nresonance of the average stack, and thus covers the observed range of IS\nfeature widths, at very nearly constant peak frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 13:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-25"}

Several authors have claimed to detect a significant cross-correlation\nbetween microwave WMAP anisotropies and the SDSS galaxy distribution. We repeat\nthese analyses to determine the different cross-correlation uncertainties\ncaused by re-sampling errors and field-to-field fluctuations. The first type of\nerror concerns overlapping sky regions, while the second type concerns\nnon-overlapping sky regions. METHODS. To measure the re-sampling errors, we use\nbootstrap and jack-knife techniques. For the field-to-field fluctuations, we\nuse three methods: 1) evaluation of the dispersion in the cross-correlation\nwhen correlating separated regions of WMAP with the original region of SDSS; 2)\nuse of mock Monte Carlo WMAP maps; 3) a new method (developed in this article),\nwhich measures the error as a function of the integral of the product of the\nself-correlations for each map. RESULTS. The average cross-correlation for b>30\ndeg. is significantly stronger than the re-sampling errors--both the jack-knife\nand bootstrap techniques provide similar results--but it is of the order of the\nfield-to-field fluctuations. This is confirmed by the cross-correlation between\nanisotropies and galaxies in more than the half of the sample being null within\nre-sampling errors. CONCLUSIONS. Re-sampling methods underestimate the errors.\nField-to-field fluctuations dominate the detected signals. The ratio of signal\nto re-sampling errors is larger than unity in a way that strongly depends on\nthe selected sky region. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence yet of\na significant detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. Hence, the\nvalue of Omega_\\Lambda ~ 0.8 obtained by the authors who assumed they were\nobserving the ISW effect would appear to have originated from noise analysis\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 14:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 16:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Unfortunately, the resulting problem Kemeny\nconsensus is NP-hard for instances with n input rankings, n being an even\ninteger greater than three.

We study at what amplitude\nthese wave are subject to instabilities. These instabilities lead to wave\nbreaking whenever the amplitude exceeds a critical value. Below this value, the\nwave reflects perfectly from the centre of the star. Wave breaking results in\nspinning up the central regions of the star, and the formation of a critical\nlayer, which acts as an absorbing barrier for ingoing waves. As these waves are\nabsorbed, the star is spun up from the inside out. This results in an important\namplitude dependence of the tidal quality factor Q'.

In the bulk the RKKY coupling is proportional to\n$1/|{\\bf R}|^3$ and displays $(1+\\cos(2{\\bf k}_D\\cdot {\\bf R})$-type\noscillations. A-A sublattice coupling is always ferromagnetic whereas A-B\nsubattice coupling is always antiferromagnetic and three times as large. We\nalso study the effect of edges in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) and find\nthat for impurities on the edge, the RKKY coupling decays exponentially because\nof the localized zero energy edge states. For impurities inside a ZGNR the bulk\ncharacteristics are quickly regained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 15:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2010 08:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We derive two\nconservation laws, which describe the equilibrium equations of elastic strips.\nIn applying these laws we find two new classes of integrable elastic strips\nwhich correspond to spherical elastic curves. We establish a connection between\nHopf tori and force--free strips, which are defined by one of the integrable\nstrips, we have found.

The\nprincipal defining characteristic is a broad, centrally reversed He II\n$\\lambda$4686 emission profile; other emission and absorption lines are also\nrotationally broadened. Recent surveys in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) have\nbrought the class membership there, including some related spectra, to 28. We\npresent a survey of the spectral morphology and rotational velocities, as a\nfirst step toward elucidating the nature of this class. Evolved, rapidly\nrotating hot stars are not expected theoretically, because the stellar winds\nshould brake the rotation. Luminosity classification of these spectra is not\npossible, because the principal criterion (He II $\\lambda$4686) is peculiar;\nhowever, the MCs provide reliable absolute magnitudes, which show that they\nspan the entire range from dwarfs to supergiants. The Onfp line-broadening\ndistribution is distinct and shifted toward larger values from those of normal\nO dwarfs and supergiants with >99.99% confidence. All cases with multiple\nobservations show line-profile variations, which even remove some objects from\nthe class temporarily. Some of them are spectroscopic binaries; it is possible\nthat the peculiar profiles may have multiple causes among different objects.\nThe origin and future of these stars are intriguing; for instance, they could\nbe stellar mergers and/or gamma-ray-burst progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 15:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
