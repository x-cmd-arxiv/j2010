The data are\nprocessed by an onboard pipeline, followed onground by a reversing step. This\npaper illustrates the LFI scientific onboard processing to fit the allowed\ndatarate. This is a lossy process tuned by using a set of 5 parameters Naver,\nr1, r2, q, O for each of the 44 LFI detectors. The paper quantifies the level\nof distortion introduced by the onboard processing, EpsilonQ, as a function of\nthese parameters. It describes the method of optimizing the onboard processing\nchain. The tuning procedure is based on a optimization algorithm applied to\nunprocessed and uncompressed raw data provided either by simulations, prelaunch\ntests or data taken from LFI operating in diagnostic mode. All the needed\noptimization steps are performed by an automated tool, OCA2, which ends with\noptimized parameters and produces a set of statistical indicators, among them\nthe compression rate Cr and EpsilonQ. For Planck/LFI the requirements are Cr =\n2.4 and EpsilonQ <= 10% of the rms of the instrumental white noise. To speedup\nthe process an analytical model is developed that is able to extract most of\nthe relevant information on EpsilonQ and Cr as a function of the signal\nstatistics and the processing parameters. This model will be of interest for\nthe instrument data analysis. The method was applied during ground tests when\nthe instrument was operating in conditions representative of flight. Optimized\nparameters were obtained and the performance has been verified, the required\ndata rate of 35.5 Kbps has been achieved while keeping EpsilonQ at a level of\n3.8% of white noise rms well within the requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 16:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

For a given\nregion, we aim to obtain a deterministic placement of sensors which, apart from\nensuring that the entire region comes under the purview of at least a single\nsensor, minimises the number of sensors utilised. We begin by considering\nregions devoid of obstacles and thus having every location amenable for\nplacement. Herein, we formalise the popular notion that sensors at the centres\nof the hexagons of a hexagonal tessellation provide the most optimal placement.\nWe then move on to regions which may comprise obstacles of arbitrary size at\narbitrary locations. We recognise two distinct classes of obstacles, namely\ntransparent and opaque obstacles, which are distinguished by their ability (or\nthe lack of it) to permit sensing radiation through them. In the real world,\ntransparent obstacles model lakes, ponds and swamps, while the opaque ones\nstand for, inter alia, hills, trees and walls.We propose a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for achieving optimal placement in the aforesaid scenarios and we\nprove its convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 18:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-27"}

Even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints of\ndeviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,\ndark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. The cosmological community\nhas subjected the WMAP data to extensive and varied analyses.

In this paper we\nexamine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of their\nsignificance. In most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posterior\nselection of some aspect or subset of the data. Compared with sky simulations\nbased on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of the\nWMAP data. Low probability features are expected, but it is not usually\nstraightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature is\nthe result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. We\nexamine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the LCDM\nmodel. We examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the sky\nmaps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,\nquadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, and\nquadrupole power asymmetry.

The existence of the Local Void (LV) has a systematic\neffect on these measurements. If the ZoA is randomly filled with mock galaxies,\nthen the calculated acceleration of the Local Group of galaxies (LG) has a\nspurious component, resulting from the lack of real galaxies in the\nintersection of the LV with the ZoA. This component affects both the\nmisalignment angle between the clustering dipole and the CMB dipole, and the\ninferred value of mean matter density Omega_m. We calculate the amplitude of\nthe spurious acceleration acting on the LG due to the LV. Its value depends on\nthe geometry and size of the LV, as well as on its density contrast. However,\nunder the simplest assumption of the LV being spherical and completely empty,\nwithin the linear theory this amplitude amounts only to about 45 km/s in units\nof velocity. The resulting change in the misalignment angle is smaller than 1\ndegree, and the fractional change in the deduced value of Omega_m is about 5%.\nAccounting for observationally indicated elongation of the LV and maintaining\nthe maximising assumption of a complete lack of galaxies inside increases these\nnumbers only moderately. Specifically, the amplitude of the spurious\nacceleration rises to about 60 km/s, the misalignment angle remains still\nsmaller than 1 degree, and the fractional change in the deduced value of\nOmega_m is enhanced to about 7%.

In general,\nour results indicate that grains with radii less than 0.1 microns are sputtered\nto much smaller radii and often destroyed completely, while larger grains\nsurvive their interaction with the reverse shock. We also find that, for high\nejecta densities, the percentage of dust that survives is strongly dependent on\nthe relative velocity between the clump and the reverse shock, causing up to\n50% more destruction for the highest velocity shocks. The fraction of dust\ndestroyed varies widely across grain species, ranging from total destruction of\nAl2O3 grains to minimal destruction of Fe grains (only 20% destruction in the\nmost extreme cases).

Inspirations for\nsuch surfaces come from studying natural systems and deducing design rules. The\nmajor attraction is that natural systems, while functionally complex, are, in\ngeneral, of optimized shape and performance. It is further believed that\nfunctional complexity of natural systems is what affords natural species to\nmorph continuously to adapt with the operating environment. One bio-species\nthat is of interest is the Ball Python. This is because such a species\ncontinuously slides against various surfaces, many of which are deemed\ntribologically hostile, without sustaining much damage. Much of the success of\nthat species in adapting to its environment is attributed to surface design\nfeatures. In that respect, studying these features and how do they contribute\nto the control of friction and wear is very attractive. This paper is a step in\nthis direction. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization\napproach to study surface design features of the Python Regius. The focus is on\nthose features that are typically used to assess the performance of high\nquality lubricating surfaces. To this end, topographical features are studied\nby SEM and through White Light Interferrometery (WLI).

In\naddition we draw a comparison of these features to those of human skin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 04:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-28"}

The composition implies a\nmass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from\nelectronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a\nmethod for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and\nmass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably\nwell established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in\nthe equation of state, such as may arise when extrapolating from low pressure\ndata, can have significant effects on predicted mass- radius relations, and on\nplanetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed\nmasses and radii of planets and exoplanets. Kepler-10b is apparently 'Earth-\nlike,' likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of\nthe mass of the planet. CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an\nFe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. GJ\n1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and CH4, suggesting an 'icy'\ncomposition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of\nH2O. CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be\nexplained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed\natmospheric opacity. HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation\nfor hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of\nhigher atomic number.

Some global\nproperties of the spectral function, such as number and positions of peaks, are\nextracted by combining optics, neutron scattering, ARPES and tunnelling\nmeasurements. These methods give convincing evidence for strong electron-phonon\ninteraction (EPI) with the coupling constant between 1-3 in cuprates near\noptimal doping. Here we clarify how these results are in favor of the\nEliashberg-like theory for HTSC cuprates near optimal doping. In Part II we\ndiscuss some theoretical ingredients - such as strong EPI, strong correlations\n- which are necessary to explain the experimental results related to the\nmechanism of d-wave pairing in optimally doped cuprates. These comprise the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory for EPI in strongly correlated systems which give rise\nto the forward scattering peak. The latter is further supported by the weakly\nscreened Madelung interaction in the ionic-metallic structure of layered\ncuprates. In this approach EPI is responsible for the strength of pairing while\nthe residual Coulomb interaction (by including spin fluctuations) triggers the\nd-wave pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 06:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

For this purpose we have assumed three\ndifferent hypotheses for the neutrino production model, characterised by the\nflavour fluxes at production \\phi_e^0:\\phi_\\mu^0:\\phi_\\tau^0 = 1:2:0, 0:1:0,\nand 1:0:0, and studied the theoretical and experimental expectations for the\nmuon-neutrino flux at Earth, \\phi_\\mu, and for the flavour ratios at Earth, R =\n\\phi_\\mu/\\phi_e and S = \\phi_\\tau/\\phi_\\mu. CPT violation (CPTV) has been\nimplemented by adding an energy-independent term to the standard neutrino\noscillation Hamiltonian. This introduces three new mixing angles, two new\neigenvalues and three new phases, all of which have currently unknown values.\nWe have varied the new mixing angles and eigenvalues within certain bounds,\ntogether with the parameters associated to pure standard oscillations. Our\nresults indicate that, for the models 1:2:0 and 0:1:0, it might possible to\nfind large deviations for \\phi_\\mu, R, and S between the cases without and with\nCPTV, provided the CPTV eigenvalues lie within 10^{-29}-10^{-27} GeV, or above.\nMoreover, if CPTV exists, there are certain values of R and S that can be\naccounted for by up to three production models. If no CPTV were observed, we\ncould set limits on the CPTV eigenvalues of the same order. Detection prospects\ncalculated using IceCube suggest that for the models 1:2:0 and 0:1:0, the\nmodifications due to CPTV are larger and more clearly separable from the\nstandard-oscillations predictions. We conclude that IceCube is potentially able\nto detect CPTV but that, depending on the values of the CPTV parameters, there\ncould be a mis-determination of the neutrino production model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 09:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2010 17:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

We present evidence for granulation in two delta Scuti stars\nof spectral type A2: HD174936 and HD50844. Recent analyses of space-based CoRoT\n(Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits) data revealed up to some 1000\nfrequencies in the photometry of these stars. The frequencies were interpreted\nas individual pulsation modes. If true, there must be large numbers of\nnonradial modes of very high degree l which should suffer cancellation effects\nin disk-integrated photometry (even of high space-based precision). The p-mode\ninterpretation of all the frequencies in HD174936 and HD50844 depends on the\nassumption of white (frequency independent) noise. Our independent analyses of\nthe data provide an alternative explanation: most of the peaks in the Fourier\nspectra are the signature of non-white granulation background noise, and less\nthan about 100 of the frequencies are actual stellar p-modes in each star. We\nfind granulation time scales which are consistent with scaling relations that\ndescribe cooler stars with known surface convection. If the granulation\ninterpretation is correct, the hundreds of low-amplitude Fourier peaks reported\nin recent studies are falsely interpreted as independent pulsation modes and a\nsignificantly lower number of frequencies are associated with pulsation,\nconsistent with only modes of low degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 09:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The main aim of\nthis work is to understand if estimates of the structural parameters of these\ncomponents determined from kinematics (as is usually done in simulations) agree\nwell with those obtained using a photometric bulge/disc/bar decomposition (as\ndone in observations). To perform such a comparison, we have produced synthetic\nobservations of the simulation outputs with the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncode SUNRISE and used the BUDDA code to make 2D photometric decompositions of\nthe resulting images (in the i and g bands). We find that the kinematic\ndisc-to-total ratio (D/T) estimates are systematically and significantly lower\nthan the photometric ones. While the maximum D/T ratios obtained with the\nformer method are of the order of 0.2, they are typically >0.4, and can be as\nhigh as 0.7, according to the latter. The photometric decomposition shows that\nmany of the simulated galaxies have bars, with Bar/T ratios in the range\n0.2-0.4, and that bulges have in all cases low Sersic indices, resembling\nobserved pseudo-bulges instead of classical ones. Simulated discs, bulges and\nbars generally have similar (g-i) colours, which are in the blue tail of the\ndistribution of observed colours. This is not due to the presence of young\nstars, but rather to low metallicities and poor gas content in the simulated\ngalaxies, which makes dust extinction low. Photometric decompositions thus\nmatch the component ratios usually quoted for spiral galaxies better than\nkinematic decompositions, but the shift is insufficient to make the simulations\nconsistent with observed late-type systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 10:28:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 09:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 17:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The broadband losses that are introduced by\nthe medium conductivity represent the main stabilization mechanism for the\ndissipative few-cycle solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 12:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

These complex dynamics can be modeled using Boolean networks,\nallowing us to explain the existence of different cell states and the\ntransition between them. Boolean models have been introduced both as specific\nexamples and as ensemble or distribution network models. However, current\nensemble Boolean network models do not make a systematic distinction between\ndifferent cell components such as epigenetic factors, gene and transcription\nfactors. Consequently, we still do not understand their relative contributions\nin controlling the cell fate. In this work we introduce and study higher order\nBoolean networks, which feature an explicit distinction between the different\ncell components and the types of interactions between them. We show that the\nstability of the cell state dynamics can be determined solving the eigenvalue\nproblem of a matrix representing the regulatory interactions and their\nstrengths. The qualitative analysis of this problem indicates that, in addition\nto the classification into stable and chaotic regimes, the cell state can be\nsimple or complex depending on whether it can be deduced from the independent\nstudy of its components or not. Finally, we illustrate how the model can be\nexpanded considering higher levels and higher order dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 15:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-28"}

The data were collected using all three instruments, IRAC, IRS,\nand MIPS, aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS data were obtained in\nspectral mapping mode, and the photometric data from IRAC and IRS were\nextracted from matched, 20 arcsec diameter circular apertures. The MIPS data\nwere obtained in SED mode, providing very low resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 20)\nbetween ~ 55 and 90 microns in a larger, 20 by 30 arcsec synthetic aperture. We\nfurther present the data from a spectral decomposition of the SEDs, including\nequivalent widths and fluxes of key emission lines; silicate 10 and 18 micron\nemission and absorption strengths; IRAC magnitudes; and mid-far infrared\nspectral indices. Finally, we examine the SEDs averaged within optical\nclassifications of activity. We find that the infrared SEDs of Seyfert 1s and\nSeyfert 2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLR, as revealed by\nspectropolarimetry or other technique) are qualitatively similar, except that\nSeyfert 1s show silicate emission and HBLR Seyfert 2s show silicate absorption.\nThe infrared SEDs of other classes with the 12 micron sample, including Seyfert\n1.8-1.9, non-HBLR Seyfert 2 (not yet shown to hide a type 1 nucleus), LINER and\nHII galaxies, appear to be dominated by star-formation, as evidenced by blue\nIRAC colors, strong PAH emission, and strong far-infrared continuum emission,\nmeasured relative to mid-infrared continuum emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 15:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Although many developments remain to be done, the\npossibility to directly use QCD to describe nuclear system is a major challenge\nthat is within reach. In this introduction to the 2009 International\nJoliot-Curie School (EJC2009), new trends in the strong nuclear interaction are\nsummarized starting from quarks and ending with finite or infinite nuclear\nsystems. At different energy scales, selected new concepts and ideas have been\ndiscussed in a rather simple way. Recent advances in the theory of nuclear\nforces, thanks to chiral perturbation and effective field theories, have led to\na new generation of strong nuclear interaction particularly suited to low\nenergy nuclear physics. The interesting aspects of new interactions compared to\nconventional forces are underlined. Recent achievements in ab initio theories\nthat directly start from the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction and their key\nrole to understand the three-body force are illustrated. Finally, future\nperspectives for standard nuclear physics theories, namely Shell Model and\nEnergy Density Functional, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 14:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
