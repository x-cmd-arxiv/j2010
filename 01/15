This result extends Cobham's theorem, which\ncharacterizes the sets of integer numbers that are recognizable by finite\nautomata in multiple bases.\n  In this article, we first generalize this result to multiplicatively\nindependent bases, which brings it closer to the original statement of Cobham's\ntheorem. Then, we study the sets of reals recognizable by Muller automata in\ntwo bases. We show with a counterexample that, in this setting, Cobham's\ntheorem does not generalize to multiplicatively independent bases. Finally, we\nprove that the sets of reals that are recognizable by Muller automata in two\nbases that do not share the same set of prime factors are exactly those\ndefinable in the first order additive theory of real and integer numbers.

In this paper we\nanalyze how CR affect these measurements and the estimates of non-gaussianity\nand of angular power spectra of the CMB. Using accurate simulations of noise\nand CR events in bolometric detectors, we find that a de-spiking technique\nbased on outliers removal in the detector signals contributing to the same sky\npixel works well in removing CR events larger than the noise. Low level events\nhidden in the noise produce skewness and kurtosis of the temperatures of the\npixels, indicating low-level non-gaussianity.

This method\nemploys an extended line index for the CH G-band, which we demonstrate to have\nsuperior behavior when compared to the narrower G-band index formerly employed\nto estimate G-band strengths for these spectra. Although CEMP stars have been\nfound previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the\nselection on metallicity undersamples the population of\nintermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (-2.5<=[Fe/H]<=-1.0); such stars are of\nimportance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient\nasymptotic giant-branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of\ncarbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include\nsubstantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in\nprevious HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that\nemphasized stars with cooler temperatures.\n  A first subsample, biased towards brighter stars (B<15.5), has been extracted\nfrom the scanned HES plates. After visual inspection, a list of 669 previously\nunidentified candidate CEMP stars was compiled. Follow-up spectroscopy for a\npilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on\nthe SOAR 4.1m telescope.

We use an\niterative procedure to find the eigenenergies and the upper and lower component\nwave functions for the ground state and then, later, some excited states.\nSolutions for the massive quarks (s, c, and b) are also presented. In Section\nIII we solve for the case of a Coulomb potential, which is a time-like\ncomponent of a Lorentz vector potential, V_v(r). We re-derive, numerically, the\n(analytically well-known) relativistic hydrogen atom eigenenergies and wave\nfunctions, and later extend that to the cases of heavier one-electron atoms and\nmuonic atoms. Finally, Section IV finds solutions for a combination of the V_s\nand V_v potentials. We treat two cases. The first is one in which V_s is the\nlinear potential used in Sec. II and V_v is Coulombic, as in Sec. III.

It is shown that the entropy inequality for a\ngranular gas that follows from the Boltzmann equation differs from the one of a\nsimple fluid due to the presence of a term which can be identified as the rate\nof entropy supply density. From the knowledge of a non-equilibrium distribution\nfunction -- valid for for processes closed to equilibrium and quasi-elastic\nrestitution coefficients -- it is obtained that the rate of entropy supply\ndensity is equal to the rate of internal energy production density divided by\nthe temperature and the entropy flux is equal to the heat flux vector divided\nby the temperature. A thermodynamic theory of a granular fluid is also\ndeveloped whose objective is the determination of the basic fields of mass\ndensity, momentum density and internal energy density. The constitutive laws\nare restricted by the principle of material frame indifference and by the\nentropy principle. Through the exploitation of the entropy principle with\nLagrange multipliers, it is shown that the results obtained from the kinetic\ntheory for granular gases concerning the rate of entropy supply density and\nentropy flux are valid in general for processes close to equilibrium of\ngranular fluids, where linearized constitutive equations hold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 18:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2010 20:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-17"}

The particular\nprotein structure is thought to be related to ion specificity, specific\nrecognition of drugs by receptors and to macroscopic phenomena as nerve pulse\npropagation. However, lipid membranes in their chain melting regime are known\nto be highly permeable to ions, water and small molecules, and are therefore\nnot always inert. In voltage-clamp experiments one finds quantized conduction\nevents through protein-free membranes in their melting regime similar to or\neven undistinguishable from those attributed to proteins. This constitutes a\nconceptual problem for the interpretation of electrophysiological data obtained\nfrom biological membrane preparations. Here, we review the experimental\nevidence for lipid ion channels, their properties and the physical chemistry\nunderlying their creation. We introduce into the thermodynamic theory of\nmembrane fluctuations from which the lipid channels originate. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate how the appearance of lipid channels can be influenced by the\nalteration of the thermodynamic variables (temperature, pressure, tension,\nchemical potentials) in a coherent description that is free of parameters. This\ndescription leads to pores that display dwell times closely coupled to the\nfluctuation lifetime via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

This uses Zeeman-Doppler magnetograms of the\nsurface magnetic field as a lower boundary condition. The ZDI maps, however,\nsuffer from the absence of information about the magnetic field over regions of\nthe surface due to the presence of dark starspots and portions of the surface\nout of view due to a tilt in the rotation axis. They also suffer from finite\nresolution which leads to small scale field structures being neglected.\n  This paper explores the effects of this loss of information on the\nextrapolated coronal fields. For this we use simulated stellar surface magnetic\nmaps for two hypothetical stars. Using the potential field approximation, the\ncoronal fields and emission measures are calculated. This is repeated for the\ncases of missing information due to, (i) starspots, (ii) a large area of the\nstellar surface out of view, (iii) a finite resolution.\n  The largest effect on the magnetic field structure arises when a significant\nportion of the stellar surface remains out of view. This changes the nature of\nthe field lines that connect to this obscured hemisphere. Nonetheless, the\nfield structure in the visible hemisphere is reliably reproduced. Thus the\ncalculation of the locations and surface filling factors of accretion funnels\nis reasonably well reproduced for the observed hemisphere. The decrease with\nheight of the magnetic pressure, which is important in calculating disc\ntruncation radii for accreting stars, is also largely unaffected in the\nequatorial plane. The fraction of surface flux that is open and therefore able\nto supply angular momentum loss in a wind, however, is often overestimated in\nthe presence of missing flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 18:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The gamma-ray peaks were essentially simultaneous with maxima at\noptical wavelengths, although the flux ratio of the two wavebands varied by an\norder of magnitude. The optical polarization vector rotated by 720 degrees\nduring a 5-day period encompassing six of these flares. This culminated in a\nvery bright, roughly 1 day, optical and gamma-ray flare as a bright knot of\nemission passed through the highest-intensity, stationary feature (the \"core\")\nseen in 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array images. The knot continued to propagate\ndown the jet at an apparent speed of 22c and emit strongly at gamma-ray\nenergies as a months-long X-ray/radio outburst intensified.

A HepML block can be included into event files in the LHEF format.\nThe structure of the HepML block is described by means of several XML Schemas.\nThe Schemas define necessary information for the HepML block and how this\ninformation should be located within the block. The library libhepml is a C++\nlibrary intended for parsing and serialization of HepML tags, and representing\nthe HepML block in computer memory. The library is an API for external\nsoftware. For example, Matrix Element Monte Carlo event generators can use the\nlibrary for preparing and writing a header of a LHEF file in the form of HepML\ntags. In turn, Showering and Hadronization event generators can parse the HepML\nheader and get the information in the form of C++ classes. libhepml can be used\nin C++, C, and Fortran programs. All necessary parts of HepML have been\nprepared and we present the project to the HEP community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 22:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 15:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2010 10:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Numerical solution of a master wave equation as\nan initial boundary value problem requires initial data.

As is well\nknown, this choice leads to a \"burst\" of junk radiation which eventually\npropagates off the computational domain.

This work studies the influence of both types\nof junk on metric perturbations, waveforms, and self-force measurements, and it\ndemonstrates that smooth modified source terms mollify the Jost solution and\nreduce junk radiation.

It is proposed that a formulation of\nthermodynamics as an action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a\nnew investigation. This third paper of the series applies the action principle\nto a study of mixtures of ideal gases. The action for a mixture of ideal gases\nis the sum of the actions for the components, with an entropy that, in the\nabsence of gravity, is determined by the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis. Chemical\nreactions such as hydrogen dissociation are studied, with results that include\nthe Saha equation and that are more complete than traditional treatments,\nespecially so when gravitational effects are included. A mixture of two ideal\ngases is a system with two degrees of freedom and consequently it exhibits two\nkinds of sound. In the presence of gravity the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis is\nmodified to get results that agree with observation. The possibility of a\nparallel treatment of real gases is illustrated by an application to van der\nWaals gases. The overall conclusion is that experimental results serve to pin\ndown the lagrangian in a very efficient manner. This leads to a convenient\ntheoretical framework in which many dynamical problems can be studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 23:08:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2010 03:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-09"}

While very high energy (VHE) flares are quite common\nin many nearby blazars, the case of 1ES 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) is\nparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibit\nunusually hard VHE spectra considering their redshifts.

The difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energy\ndistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-ray\nemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new VERITAS\nobservations.

The\ninferred system parameters suggest that this system may have evolved beyond the\norbital period minimum and is a bounce-back system. SDSS1238 stands out among\nCVs by exhibiting the cyclical variability (brightenings). These are not\nrelated to specific orbital phases of the binary system and are fainter than\ndwarf novae outbursts, that usually occur on longer timescales. This phenomenon\nhas not been observed extensively and, thus, is poor understood. The new\ntime-resolved, multi-longitude photometric observations of SDSS1238 allowed us\nto observe two consecutive brightenings and to determine their recurrence time.\nThe period analysis of all observed brightenings during 2007 suggests a typical\ntimescale that is close to a period of ~9.3 hours. However, the brightenings\nmodulation is not strictly periodic, possibly maintaining coherence only on\ntimescales of several weeks. The characteristic variability with double orbital\nfrequency that clearly shows up during brightenings is also analyzed. The\nDoppler mapping of the system shows the permanent presence of a spiral arm\npattern in the accretion disk. A simple model is presented to demonstrate that\nspiral arms in the velocity map appear at the location and phase corresponding\nto the 2:1 resonance radius and constitute themselves as a double-humped light\ncurves. The long-term and short-term variability of this CV is discussed\ntogether with the spiral arm structure of an accretion disk in the context of\nobservational effects taking place in bounce-back systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 01:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 05:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

A main drawback of manifold\nlearning methods is, however, that there is no explicit mappings from the input\ndata manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of\nmanifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and\ntarget detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for\nmanifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an\napproximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there\nexists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their\nlow-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too\nrestrictive. In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping is proposed for\nmanifold learning, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial\nmapping between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional\nrepresentations. As far as we know, this is the first time that an explicit\nnonlinear mapping for manifold learning is given. In particular, we apply this\nto the method of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and derive an explicit\nnonlinear manifold learning algorithm, named Neighborhood Preserving Polynomial\nEmbedding (NPPE). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data\nshow that the proposed mapping is much more effective in preserving the local\nneighborhood information and the nonlinear geometry of the high-dimensional\ndata samples than previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 03:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-18"}

Moreover, dust production by Type II supernovae (SNe II) can be\nefficient in starburst galaxies. In this paper, we examine the effect of\nshattering in WIM on the dust grains produced by SNe II. We find that although\nthe grains ejected from SNe II are expected to be biased to large sizes ($a\\ga\n0.1 \\micron$, where $a$ is the grain radius) because of the shock destruction\nin supernova remnants, the shattering in WIM is efficient enough in $\\sim 5$\nMyr to produce small grains if the metallicity is nearly solar or more. The\nproduction of small grains by shattering steepens the extinction curve. Thus,\nsteepening of extinction curves by shattering should always be taken into\naccount for the system where the metallicity is solar and the starburst age is\ntypically larger than 5 Myr.

The\nnonequilibrium phonons then in turn influence the electron spin relaxation\nproperties via modifying the electron heating and drifting. The spin relaxation\ntime is elongated due to the enhanced electron heating and thus the\nelectron-phonon scattering in the presence of nonequilibrium phonons. The\nfrequency of spin precession, which is roughly proportional to the electron\ndrift velocity, can be either increased (at low electric field and/or high\nlattice temperature) or decreased (at high electric field and/or low lattice\ntemperature).

Using the GBM\ndata, we identified a ~150-s-long enhanced persistent emission during 2009\nJanuary 22 that exhibited intriguing timing and spectral properties: (i) clear\npulsations up to ~110 keV at the spin period of the neutron star, (ii) an\nadditional (to a power-law) blackbody component required for the enhanced\nemission spectra with kT ~ 17 keV, (iii) pulsed fraction that is strongly\nenergy dependent and highest in the 50-74 keV energy band.

We present the results of a number of tests\ndemonstrating the capability of the LFI data processing centre (DPC) to\nproperly reduce and analyse LFI flight data, from telemetry information to\ncalibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (in\ntemperature and polarization), component emission maps (CMB and diffuse\nforegrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the Early Release\nCompact Source Catalogue and the Final Compact Source Catalogue). The\norganization of the LFI consortium is briefly presented as well as the role of\nthe core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. All tests carried\nout on the LFI flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of the\ninstrument and its various subunits. The data analysis pipeline has been tested\nand its main steps verified. In the first three months after launch, the\ncommissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will be\ncompleted, after which Planck will begin its operational life, in which LFI\nwill have an integral part.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 10:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Models are illustrated using cognitive functioning data for older\nadults. For unconditional models, deaths do not occur, deaths are independent\nof the longitudinal response, or the unconditional longitudinal response is\naveraged over the survival distribution. Unconditional models, such as random\neffects models fit to unbalanced data, may implicitly impute data beyond the\ntime of death. Fully conditional models stratify the longitudinal response\ntrajectory by time of death. Fully conditional models are effective for\ndescribing individual trajectories, in terms of either aging (age, or years\nfrom baseline) or dying (years from death). Causal models (principal\nstratification) as currently applied are fully conditional models, since group\ndifferences at one timepoint are described for a cohort that will survive past\na later timepoint. Partly conditional models summarize the longitudinal\nresponse in the dynamic cohort of survivors. Partly conditional models are\nserial cross-sectional snapshots of the response, reflecting the average\nresponse in survivors at a given timepoint rather than individual trajectories.\nJoint models of survival and longitudinal response describe the evolving health\nstatus of the entire cohort. Researchers using longitudinal data should\nconsider which method of accommodating deaths is consistent with research aims,\nand use analysis methods accordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 14:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-18"}

The input-output map expressed by\nthese architectures turns out to be equivalent to a suitable single-layer\nkernel machines in which the kernel function is also learned from the data.\nRecently, the so-called multiple kernel learning methods have attracted\nconsiderable attention in the machine learning literature.

For the first time we\nquantified, via the \"locally optimally emitting cloud\" model, the contribution\nof the broad line region (BLR) to the absolute luminosity of the broad\ncomponent of the Fe K alpha at 6.4 keV.

Most of the luminosity of the unresolved,\ncomponent of Fe K alpha may come from the obscuring torus, while the very-broad\nassociated component may come from the accretion disk.

Here we show that the Hanle effect in H$\\alpha$ provides\nquantitative information on the magnetism of the quiet chromosphere.
