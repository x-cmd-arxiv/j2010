Understanding how microscopic dynamics\ndetermines the averages and fluctuations of these currents is one of the main\nopen problems in nonequilibrium statistical physics. The additivity principle\nis a theoretical proposal that allows to compute the current distribution in\nmany one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. Using simulations, we confirm this\nconjecture in a simple and general model of energy transport, both in the\npresence of a temperature gradient and in canonical equilibrium. In particular,\nwe show that the current distribution displays a Gaussian regime for small\ncurrent fluctuations, as prescribed by the central limit theorem, and\nnon-Gaussian (exponential) tails for large current deviations, obeying in all\ncases the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem. In order to facilitate a given\ncurrent fluctuation, the system adopts a well-defined temperature profile\ndifferent from that of the steady state, and in accordance with the additivity\nhypothesis predictions. System statistics during a large current fluctuation is\nindependent of the sign of the current, which implies that the optimal profile\n(as well as higher-order profiles and spatial correlations) are invariant upon\ncurrenst inversion. We also demonstrate that finite-time joint fluctuations of\nthe current and the profile are well described by the additivity functional.\nThese results confirm the additivity hypothesis as a general and powerful tool\nto compute current distributions in many nonequilibrium systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 18:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-08"}

The ability to\ndo this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense\nthat the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale, and decay\non a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system. Since the\nequilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system\nparameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet, the latter\ncan be determined with accurate measurements of the planet's eccentricity and\nradius. However, this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the\nsystem is coplanar. Here we generalize our recent analysis of this fixed-point\nphenomenon to mutually inclined systems and show that the fixed point of\ncoplanar systems is replaced by a limit cycle, with the average value of the\neccentricity decreasing and its amplitude of variation increasing with\nincreasing mutual inclination. This behaviour significantly reduces the ability\nto unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the\nmutual inclination is higher than around 10^o. We show that for Q-values less\nthan 10^6, the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and\n126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to\nquickly move the inclination outside this range, and that the behaviour of\nretrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems. We derive\na relationship between the equilibrium radius of the short-period planet, its\nQ-value and its core mass, and show that given current estimates of e_b and the\nplanet radius, the HAT-P-13 system is likely to be close to coplanar [...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 21:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 20:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Probing\nits characteristics provides a wealth of information on the details of possible\nevolution processes of dS0 galaxies which may not be possible in other, more\ndistant objects. In order to study its kinematics and star formation history,\nwe obtained long slit spectroscopy at the OHP 1m93 telescope along the major\nand minor axes of NGC404. The spectra have a resolution R = 3600 covering a\nwavelength range from 4600 to 5500 A. The data are fitted against the Pegase.HR\nstellar population models to derive simultaneously the internal stellar\nkinematics, ages and metallicities. Firstly, the global properties of the\ngalaxy are analyzed by fitting a single model and to the data and looking at\nthe kinematic variations and SSP equivalent age and metallicities as a function\nof radius. Afterwards, the stellar populations are decomposed into 4 components\nthat are individually analyzed. NGC404 clearly shows two radial velocity\ninversions along its major axis. The kinematically decoupled core rotates in\nthe same direction as the neutral hydrogen shell that surrounds the galaxy. We\nresolved the star formation history in the core of the galaxy ino 4 events: A\nvery young (< 150 Myr, and [Fe/H] = 0.4) component with constant on-going star\nformation, a second young (430 Myr) component with [Fe/H] = 0.1, an\nintermediate population (1.7 Gyr) which has [Fe/H] = -0.05 and, finally, an old\n(12 Gyr) component with [Fe/H] = -1.26.

Antiplasticization is\naccompanied by a \"toughening\" of the glass mixture relative to the pure\npolymer, and this effect is found to occur when the diluents are small species\nwith strongly attractive interactions with the polymer matrix. Plasticization\nleads to a decreased glass transition temperature T_g and a \"softening\" of the\nfragile host polymer in the glass state. Plasticization is prompted by small\nadditives with weakly attractive interactions with the polymer matrix. The\nshifts in T_g of polystyrene diluted by fully flexible short oligomers are\nevaluated from the computations, along with the relative changes in the\nisothermal compressibility at T_g to characterize the extent to which the\nadditives act as antiplasticizers or plasticizers.

We find that the vorticity field does not follow the filaments and\nsheets structures of underlying dark matter density field and shows highly non-\nGaussian and intermittent features. The power spectrum of the vorticity field\nis used to measure the development of turbulence in Fourier space. We show that\nthe relation between the power spectra of vorticity and velocity fields is\nperfectly in agreement with the prediction of a fully developed homogeneous and\nisotropic turbulence from 0.2 to 3 h^{-1} Mpc at z~0. This indicates that\ncosmic baryonic field is in the state of fully developed turbulence on scales\nless than about 3 h^{-1} Mpc.

Our\ndesign is structured into three main modules: a black box residue computation\nin charge of computing each residue; a Chinese remaindering controller in\ncharge of launching the computation and of the termination decision; an integer\nbuilder in charge of the reconstruction computation. We then show that this\ndesign enables many different forms of Chinese remaindering (e.g.\ndeterministic, early terminated, distributed, etc.), easy comparisons between\nthese forms and e.g. user-transparent parallelism at different parallel grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2010 12:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

Now\nwe are interested in separation from the general database of the components the\n\"clouds\" of closely spaced similar Gaussians. In this paper we describe the new\ncloud-finding algorithm. To separate the clouds of similar Gaussians, we start\nwith the single-link hierarchical clustering procedure in five-dimensional\n(longitude, latitude, velocity, Gaussian width and height) space, but make some\nmodifications to accommodate it to the large number of components. We also use\nthe requirement that each cloud may be represented at any observed sky position\nby only one Gaussian and take into account the similarity of global properties\nof the merging clouds. As a test, we apply the algorithm for finding the clouds\nof the narrowest HI 21-cm line components. Using the full sky search for cold\nclouds, we easily detect the coldest known HI clouds and demonstrate that\nactually they are a part of a long narrow ribbon of cold clouds. We model these\nclouds as a part of a planar gas ring, deduce their spatial placement, and\ndiscuss their relation to supernova shells in the solar neighborhood. We\nconclude that the proposed algorithm satisfactorily solves the posed task. We\nguess that the study of the narrowest HI 21-cm line components may be a useful\ntool for finding the structure of neutral gas in solar neighborhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2010 15:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-13"}
