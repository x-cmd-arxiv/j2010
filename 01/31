Since such operators are not prohibited from occurring in the\naction, they appear to threaten the very existence of such fixed points. At the\nsame time, for NLSMs describing metal-insulator transitions of Anderson\nlocalization in electronic conductors, the strong RG-relevance of these\noperators has been previously related to statistical properties of the\nconductance of samples of large finite size (\"conductance fluctuations\"). In\nthis paper, we analyze this question, not for perturbative RG treatments of\nNLSMs, but for 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models at level k, perturbatively in\nthe current-current interaction of the Noether current. WZW models are special\n(\"Principal Chiral\") NLSMs on a Lie Group G with a WZW term at level k. In\nthese models the role of high-gradient operators is played by homogeneous\npolynomials of order 2s in the Noether currents, whose scaling dimensions we\nanalyze. For the Lie Supergroup G=GL(2N|2N) and k=1, this corresponds to\ntime-reversal invariant problems of Anderson localization in the so-called\nchiral symmetry classes, and the strength of the current-current interaction, a\nmeasure of the strength of disorder, is known to be completely marginal (for\nany k). We find that all high-gradient (polynomial) operators are, to one loop\norder, irrelevant or relevant depending on the sign of that interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2010 11:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
