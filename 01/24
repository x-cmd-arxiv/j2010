The use of time-division multiple access (TDMA) and FDMA\n(frequency DMA) technology allows multiple customers within a 3-5 mile coverage\nradius to share the same radio channel. Customers can receive data rates\nbetween 64kbps to 155Mbps. LMDS was conceived as a broadband, fixed wireless,\npoint-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Throughput\ncapacity and reliable distance of the link depends on common radio link\nconstraints and the modulation method used - either phase-shift keying or\namplitude modulation. In general deployment links of up to 5 miles (8 km) from\nthe base station are possible, but distance is typically limited to about 1.5\nmiles due to rain fading attenuation constraints. Point-to-point systems are\nalso capable of using the LMDS frequencies and can reach slightly farther\ndistances due to increased antenna gain.LMDS uses a scalable architecture\ncombined with industry standards to ensure service can be expanded as customer\ndemand increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2010 18:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

The\nmodels have stochastic population dynamics with mutation, migration, and\nextinction of species. Mutants appear as a result of mutation of the resident\nspecies, while migrants have no correlation with the resident species. It is\nfound that the dynamics of community assembly with mutations are quite\ndifferent from the case with migrations. In contrast to mutation models, which\nshow intermittent dynamics of quasi-steady states interrupted by sudden\nreorganizations of the community, migration models show smooth and gradual\nrenewal of the community. As a consequence, instead of the $1/f$ diversity\nfluctuations found for the mutation models, $1/f^2$, random-walk like\nfluctuations are observed for the migration models. In addition, a\ncharacteristic species-lifetime distribution is found: a power law that is cut\noff by a \"skewed\" distribution in the long-lifetime regime. The latter has a\nlonger tail than a simple exponential function, which indicates an\nage-dependent species-mortality function.

This is inconsistent with one of the primary results of\nclassic dynamical simulations of the widely accepted giant impact model for the\nformation of the Moon, namely that most of the mass of the Moon originates from\nthe impactor, not Earth.\n  Resolution of this discrepancy without changing the main premises of the\ngiant impact model requires total isotopic homogenisation of Earth and impactor\nmaterial after the impact for a wide range of elements including O, Si, K, Ti,\nNd and W. Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity, it is\nunlikely to work for the much heavier, refractory elements. Given the\nincreasing uncertainty surrounding the giant impact model in light of these\ngeochemical data, alternative hypotheses for lunar formation should be\nexplored. In this paper, we revisit the hypothesis that the Moon was formed\ndirectly from terrestrial mantle material. We show that the dynamics of this\nscenario requires a large amount of energy, almost instantaneously generated\nadditional energy. The only known source for this additional energy is nuclear\nfission. We show that it is feasible to form the Moon through the ejection of\nterrestrial silicate material triggered by a nuclear explosion at Earths\ncore-mantle boundary (CMB), causing a shock wave propagating through the Earth.\nHydrodynamic modelling of this scenario shows that a shock wave created by\nrapidly expanding plasma resulting from the explosion disrupts and expels\noverlying mantle and crust material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2010 14:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 20:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

Besides its role in transcriptional regulation, chromatin loops\nhave been proposed to play a pivotal role in the segregation of entire\nchromosomes. The detailed topological and entropic forces between loops still\nremain elusive. Here, we quantitatively determine the potential of mean force\nbetween the centers of mass of two ring polymers, i.e. loops. We find that the\ntransition from a linear to a ring polymer induces a strong increase in the\nentropic repulsion between these two polymers. On top, topological interactions\nsuch as the non-catenation constraint further reduce the number of accessible\nconformations of close-by ring polymers by about 50%, resulting in an\nadditional effective repulsion. Furthermore, the transition from linear to ring\npolymers displays changes in the conformational and structural properties of\nthe system. In fact, ring polymers adopt a markedly more ordered and aligned\nstate than linear ones. The forces and accompanying changes in shape and\nalignment between ring polymers suggest an important regulatory function of\nsuch a topology in biopolymers. We conjecture that dynamic loop formation in\nchromatin might act as a versatile control mechanism regulating and maintaining\ndifferent local states of compaction and order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2010 15:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

An arbitrary voltage is applied to\nthe tunnel junction and electrons in the leads are considered to be at zero\ntemperature. The transient and the steady state behavior of the system is\nconsidered here in order to explore the quantum dynamics of the oscillator as a\nfunction of time. The properties of the phonon distribution of the\nnanomechnical oscillator strongly coupled to the electrons on the dot are\ninvestigated using a non-perturbative approach. We consider both the energy\ntransferred from the electrons to the oscillator and the Fano factor as a\nfunction of time. We discuss the quantum dynamics of the nanomechanical\noscillator in terms of pure and mixed states. We have found a significant\ndifference between a quantum and a classical oscillator. In particular, the\nenergy of a classical oscillator will always be dissipated by the electrons\nwhereas the quantum oscillator remains in an excited state. This will provide\nuseful insight for the design of experiments aimed at studying the quantum\nbehavior of an oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2010 15:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
