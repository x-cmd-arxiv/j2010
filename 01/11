Nonlinear optical effects, such as four-wave\nmixing (FWM) and parametric gain, have long been explored to realize\nall-optical functions in glass fibers. An alternative approach is to employ\nnanoscale engineering of silicon waveguides to enhance the optical\nnonlinearities by up to five orders of magnitude, enabling integrated\nchip-scale all-optical signal processing. Previously, strong two-photon\nabsorption (TPA) of the telecom-band pump has been a fundamental and\nunavoidable obstacle, limiting parametric gain to values on the order of a few\ndB. Here we demonstrate a silicon nanophotonic optical parametric amplifier\nexhibiting gain as large as 25.4 dB, by operating the pump in the mid-IR near\none-half the band-gap energy (E~0.55eV, lambda~2200nm), at which parasitic\nTPA-related absorption vanishes. This gain is high enough to compensate all\ninsertion losses, resulting in 13 dB net off-chip amplification. Furthermore,\ndispersion engineering dramatically increases the gain bandwidth to more than\n220 nm, all realized using an ultra-compact 4 mm silicon chip. Beyond its\nsignificant relevance to all-optical signal processing, the broadband\nparametric gain also facilitates the simultaneous generation of multiple\non-chip mid-IR sources through cascaded FWM, covering a 500 nm spectral range.\nTogether, these results provide a foundation for the construction of\nsilicon-based room-temperature mid-IR light sources including tunable\nchip-scale parametric oscillators, optical frequency combs, and supercontinuum\ngenerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2010 16:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Our 25 models are launched from a 15 solar mass\nprogenitor, a spherically symmetric effective general relativistic potential,\nthe Lattimer-Swesty or the Shen equation of state (EoS), and a neutrino\nparametrisation scheme which is accurate until about 5ms postbounce. For 3\nrepresentative models, we also include long-term neutrino physics by means of a\nleakage scheme. Non- or only slowly rotating models show GW emission due to\nprompt and proto-neutron star convection, allowing the distinction between the\ntwo different nuclear EoS. For moderately or fast rotation rates models, we\nfind, in agreement with recent results, only a type I GW signature at core\nbounce. Models which are set up with an initial central angular velocity of >~\n2pi rad/s emit GWs due to the low T/|W| dynamical instability during the\npostbounce phase. Weak B-fields do not notably influence the dynamical\nevolution of the core and thus the GW emission. However, for strong initial\npoloidal B-fields (~1e12 G),flux-freezing and field winding leads to conditions\nwhere P_{mag}/P_{mat} ~ 1, causing the onset of a jet-like supernova explosion\nand hence the emission of a type IV GW signal. In contradiction to axisymmetric\nsimulations, we find evidence that nonaxisymmetric fluid modes can counteract\nor even suppress jet formation for models with strong initial toroidal\nB-fields. We point out that the inclusion of the deleptonisation during the\npostbounce phase is an indispensable issue for the quantitative prediction of\nGWs from core-collapse supernovae, as it can alter the GW amplitude up to a\nfactor of 10 compared to a pure hydrodynamical treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 01:37:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2010 16:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Another\nbeneficial property is a low complexity soft decision decoder, which for\northogonal complex MIMO codes is known for two transmit (Tx) antennas i.e. for\nthe Alamouti code. We propose novel soft decision decoders for the orthogonal\ncomplex MIMO codes on three and four Tx antennas and extend the old result of\nmaximal ratio combining (MRC) to cover all orthogonal codes up to four Tx\nantennas.\n  As a rule, a sophisticated transmission scheme encompasses forward error\ncorrection (FEC) coding, and its performance is measured at the FEC decoder\ninstead of at the MIMO decoder. We introduce the receiver structure that\ndelivers the MIMO decoder's soft decisions to the demodulator, which in turn\ncranks out the logarithm of likelihood ratio (LLR) of each bit and delivers\nthem to the FEC decoder. This makes a significant improvement on the receiver,\nwhere a maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO decoder makes hard decisions at a too\nearly stage.

In this paper, we consider optimal estimation of the null density and the\nproportion of nonnull effects. Both minimax lower and upper bounds are derived.\nThe lower bound is established by a two-point testing argument, where at the\ncore is the novel construction of two least favorable marginal densities $f_1$\nand $f_2$. The density $f_1$ is heavy tailed both in the spatial and frequency\ndomains and $f_2$ is a perturbation of $f_1$ such that the characteristic\nfunctions associated with $f_1$ and $f_2$ match each other in low frequencies.\nThe minimax upper bound is obtained by constructing estimators which rely on\nthe empirical characteristic function and Fourier analysis. The estimator is\nshown to be minimax rate optimal. Compared to existing methods in the\nliterature, the proposed procedure not only provides more precise estimates of\nthe null density and the proportion of the nonnull effects, but also yields\nmore accurate results when used inside some multiple testing procedures which\naim at controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR).

Because even low activity stars would produce such a signal,\nit is crucial to determine how it influences our ability to detect small\nplanetary signals such as those produced by Earth-mass planets in the habitable\nzone (HZ). In a recent paper, we investigated the impact of sunlike spots. We\naim here to investigate the additional impact of plages. We used the spot and\nplage properties over a solar cycle to derive the RV that would be observed if\nthe Sun was seen edge-on. The RV signal comes from the photometric contribution\nof spots and plages and from the attenuation of the convective blueshift in\nplages. We compared the RV signal with the signal that would be produced by an\nEarth-mass planet in the HZ. We find that the photometric contributions of\nspots and plages to the RV signal partially balance each other out, so that the\nresidual signal is comparable to the spot signal. However, the plage\ncontribution due to the convective blueshift attenuation dominates the total\nsignal, with an amplitude over the solar cycle of about 8-10 m/s. This\ncontribution is very strongly correlated with the Ca index on the long term,\nwhich may be a way to distinguish between stellar activity and a planet.\nProviding a very good temporal sampling and signal-to-noise ratio, the\nphotometric contribution of plages and spots should not prevent detection of\nEarth-mass planets in the HZ. However, the convection contribution makes such a\ndirect detection impossible, unless its effect can be corrected for by methods\nthat still need to be found. We show that it is possible to identify the\nconvection contribution if the sensitivity is good enough, for example, by\nusing activity indicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 11:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 08:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In the wake of this null\nsignal, many \"contact pessimistic\" hypotheses have been formulated, the most\nfamous of which is the Rare Earth Hypothesis. It postulates that although\nterrestrial planets may be common, the exact environmental conditions that\nEarth enjoys are rare, perhaps unique. As a result, simple microbial life may\nbe common, but complex metazoans (and hence intelligence) will be rare. This\npaper uses Monte Carlo Realisation Techniques to investigate the Rare Earth\nHypothesis, in particular the environmental criteria considered imperative to\nthe existence of intelligence on Earth.\n  By comparing with a less restrictive, more optimistic hypothesis, the data\nindicates that if the Rare Earth hypothesis is correct, intelligent\ncivilisation will indeed be relatively rare. Studying the separations of pairs\nof civilisations shows that most intelligent civilisation pairs (ICPs) are\nunconnected: that is, they will not be able to exchange signals at lightspeed\nin the limited time that both are extant. However, the few ICPs that are\nconnected are strongly connected, being able to participate in numerous\nexchanges of signals. This may provide encouragement for SETI researchers:\nalthough the Rare Earth Hypothesis is in general a contact-pessimistic\nhypothesis, it may be a \"soft\" or \"exclusive\" hypothesis, i.e. it may contain\nfacets that are latently contact-optimistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 15:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-19"}
