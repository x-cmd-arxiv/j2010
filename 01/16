New vector bosons with such small couplings\narise naturally from a small kinetic mixing of the \"dark photon\" A' with the\nphoton -- one of the very few ways in which new forces can couple to the\nStandard Model -- and have received considerable attention as an explanation of\nvarious dark matter related anomalies. A' bosons are produced by radiation off\nan electron beam, and could appear as narrow resonances with small production\ncross-section in the trident e+e- spectrum. We summarize the experimental\napproach described in a proposal submitted to Jefferson Laboratory's PAC35,\nPR-10-009. This experiment, the A' Experiment (APEX), uses the electron beam of\nthe Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Laboratory\n(CEBAF) at energies of ~1-4 GeV incident on 0.5-10% radiation length Tungsten\nwire mesh targets, and measures the resulting e+e- pairs to search for the A'\nusing the High Resolution Spectrometer and the septum magnet in Hall A. With a\n~1 month run, APEX will achieve very good sensitivity because the statistics of\ne+e- pairs will be ~10,000 times larger in the explored mass range than any\nprevious search for the A' boson. These statistics and the excellent mass\nresolution of the spectrometers allow sensitivity to alpha'/alpha one to three\norders of magnitude below current limits, in a region of parameter space of\ngreat theoretical and phenomenological interest. Similar experiments could also\nbe performed at other facilities, such as the Mainz Microtron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 17:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

There are many \"targets\" for the\nadvertisements, and each \"target\" has a collection of games with a potentially\ndifferent set of players involved. In this paper, we study the problem of how\nadvertisers allocate their budget across these \"targets\". In particular, we\nfocus on formulating their best response strategy as an optimization problem.\nAdvertisers have a set of keywords (\"targets\") and some stochastic information\nabout the future, namely a probability distribution over scenarios of cost vs\nclick combinations. This summarizes the potential states of the world assuming\nthat the strategies of other players are fixed. Then, the best response can be\nabstracted as stochastic budget optimization problems to figure out how to\nspread a given budget across these keywords to maximize the expected number of\nclicks.\n  We present the first known non-trivial poly-logarithmic approximation for\nthese problems as well as the first known hardness results of getting better\nthan logarithmic approximation ratios in the various parameters involved. We\nalso identify several special cases of these problems of practical interest,\nsuch as with fixed number of scenarios or with polynomial-sized parameters\nrelated to cost, which are solvable either in polynomial time or with improved\napproximation ratios. Stochastic budget optimization with scenarios has\nsophisticated technical structure.

Since\ndynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and\nconvective motions, the introduction of rotation in the ATON 2.3 stellar code\nallows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic\neffects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable\nmathematical and numerical challenges involved.

Our theoretical values of tau_c, tau_g and Ro qualitatively agree\nwith those published by Kim & Demarque (1996). By increasing the convection\nefficiency, tau_g decreases for a given mass.

Here we consider so-called \"hedgerow\"\nprominences, which consist of thin vertical threads. We explore the possibility\nthat such prominences are supported by tangled magnetic fields. A variety of\ndifferent approaches are used. First, the dynamics of plasma within a tangled\nfield is considered. We find that the contorted shape of the flux tubes\nsignificantly reduces the flow velocity compared to the supersonic free fall\nthat would occur in a straight vertical tube. Second, linear force-free models\nof tangled fields are developed, and the elastic response of such fields to\ngravitational forces is considered. We demonstrate that the prominence plasma\ncan be supported by the magnetic pressure of a tangled field that pervades not\nonly the observed dense threads but also their local surroundings. Tangled\nfields with field strengths of about 10 G are able to support prominence\nthreads with observed hydrogen density of the order of 10^(11) cm^(-3).\nFinally, we suggest that the observed vertical threads are the result of\nRayleigh-Taylor instability. Simulations of the density distribution within a\nprominence thread indicate that the peak density is much larger than the\naverage density.

In a four-component description a change of basis for the relevant\nmatrices renders the Hamiltonian imaginary and the full, space-time dependent\nfield is real, as is the case for the relativistic Majorana equation in the\nMajorana matrix representation. More broadly, we show that the Majorana\nquantization procedure is generic to superconductors, with or without the Dirac\nstructure, and follows from the constraints of fermionic statistics on the\nsymmetries of Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians.

With this\nresearch project, we are looking for evidence of a connection between\nvariations in the cosmic ray flux and variations in the size of the ozone hole.\nIn addition, we are looking for signs of the kind of processes that physically\nconnect GCR fluxes with variations in the stratospheric ozone hole size (OHS)\nin the Antarctic region.

Our Pleiads, selected for their\nsmall projected rotational velocity and modest chromospheric emission, evince\nsubstantial scatter in the linestrengths of 6707 Li I feature that is absent in\nthe 7699 K I resonance line. The Li I scatter is not correlated with that in\nthe high-excitation 7774 O I feature, and the magnitude of the former is\ngreater than the latter despite the larger temperature sensitivity of the O I\nfeature. These results suggest that systematic errors in linestrength\nmeasurements due to blending, color (or color-based T_eff) errors, or line\nformation effects related to an overlying chromosphere are not the principal\nsource of Li I scatter in our stars.

Therefore, existing literature focuses on using the most\nsuccessful channel codes namely, LDPC codes, turbo codes, and their variants,\nto solve this problem assuming classical unique decoding of the underlying\nchannel code. In this paper, in contrast to classical decoding, we have taken\nthe list decoding approach. We show that syndrome source coding using list\ndecoding can achieve the theoretical limit. We argue that, as opposed to\nchannel coding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder\ncan effectively be recovered in case of SCSI, since we are dealing with a\nvirtual noisy channel rather than a real noisy channel. Finally, we present a\nguideline for designing constructive SCSI schemes using Reed Solomon code, BCH\ncode, and Reed-Muller code, which are the known list-decodable codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2010 04:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-19"}

This is in stark contrast to the dilute gases of ultracold atoms,\nwhich have isotropic and extremely short-range, or \"contact\", interactions. The\nlarge electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned with an external\nelectric field; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold\nchemical reactions, quantum information processing, and the realization of\nnovel quantum many-body systems. In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed\nat observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules, only recently\nhave sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here, we report the observation\nof dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum\ndegeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a\ndramatic increase in the loss rate of fermionic KRb molecules due to ultrcold\nchemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence\non the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be\nunderstood with a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for\nscattering of fermionic polar molecules. We directly observe the spatial\nanisotropy of the dipolar interaction as manifested in measurements of the\nthermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range\ndipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction\nrates in an ultracold polar molecule gas. The large loss rates in an applied\nelectric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar\nmolecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to\nsuppress the influence of the attractive dipolar interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2010 07:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The selected methods lean on four\ndifferent reconstruction techniques based on recently improved versions of the\nweighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, monotonicity preserving\n(MP) schemes as well as slope-limited polynomial reconstruction. The proposed\nnumerical methods are highly accurate in smooth regions of the flow, avoid loss\nof accuracy in proximity of smooth extrema and provide sharp non-oscillatory\ntransitions at discontinuities. We suggest a numerical formulation based on a\ncell-centered approach where all of the primary flow variables are discretized\nat the zone center. The divergence-free condition is enforced by augmenting the\nMHD equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier yielding a mixed\nhyperbolic/parabolic correction, as in Dedner et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 175\n(2002) 645-673). The resulting family of schemes is robust, cost-effective and\nstraightforward to implement. Compared to previous existing approaches, it\ncompletely avoids the CPU intensive workload associated with an elliptic\ndivergence cleaning step and the additional complexities required by staggered\nmesh algorithms. Extensive numerical testing demonstrate the robustness and\nreliability of the proposed framework for computations involving both smooth\nand discontinuous features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2010 14:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2010 19:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We also explore the temporal evolution of\nthe co-authorship patterns between a sample of 12 IAC responsible for 98% of\nthe total regional publications, with a group of other 45 nations. We show that\nthe scientific co-authorship among countries follows a power-law and behaves as\na self-organizing scale-free network, where each country appears as a node and\neach co-publication as a link. We develop a mathematical model to study the\ntemporal evolution of co-authorship networks, based on a preferential\nattachment strategy and we show that the number of co-publications among\ncountries growths quadraticly against time. We empirically determine the\nquadratic growth constants for 352 different networks within. We corroborate\nthat the connectivity of regional countries with larger scientific networks is\ngrowing faster than with other less connected countries. We determine the\ndates, at which the co-authorship connectivities trigger the self-organizing\nscale free network for each of the 352 cases.

The evolution of the stars is followed through the\ninspiral phase, the merger and prompt collapse to a black hole, up until the\nappearance of a thick accretion disk, which is studied as it enters and remains\nin a regime of quasi-steady accretion. Although a simple ideal-fluid equation\nof state with \\Gamma=2 is used, this work presents a systematic study within a\nfully general relativistic framework of the properties of the resulting\nblack-hole--torus system produced by the merger of unequal-mass binaries. More\nspecifically, we show that: (1) The mass of the torus increases considerably\nwith the mass asymmetry and equal-mass binaries do not produce significant tori\nif they have a total baryonic mass M_tot >~ 3.7 M_sun; (2) Tori with masses\nM_tor ~ 0.2 M_sun are measured for binaries with M_tot ~ 3.4 M_sun and mass\nratios q ~ 0.75-0.85; (3) The mass of the torus can be estimated by the simple\nexpression M_tor(q, M_tot) = [c_1 (1-q) + c_2](M_max-M_tot), involving the\nmaximum mass for the binaries and coefficients constrained from the\nsimulations, and suggesting that the tori can have masses as large as M_tor ~\n0.35 M_sun for M_tot ~ 2.8 M_sun and q ~ 0.75-0.85; (4) Using a novel technique\nto analyze the evolution of the tori we find no evidence for the onset of\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and that very little, if any, of their mass is\nunbound; (5) Finally, for all the binaries considered we compute the complete\ngravitational waveforms and the recoils imparted to the black holes, discussing\nthe prospects of detection of these sources for a number of present and future\ndetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2010 19:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 21:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
