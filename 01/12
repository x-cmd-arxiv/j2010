In this paper, we\npresent a novel grammar representation that allows efficient random access to\nany character or substring without decompressing the string.\n  Let $S$ be a string of length $N$ compressed into a context-free grammar\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of size $n$. We present two representations of $\\mathcal{S}$\nachieving $O(\\log N)$ random access time, and either $O(n\\cdot \\alpha_k(n))$\nconstruction time and space on the pointer machine model, or $O(n)$\nconstruction time and space on the RAM. Here, $\\alpha_k(n)$ is the inverse of\nthe $k^{th}$ row of Ackermann's function. Our representations also efficiently\nsupport decompression of any substring in $S$: we can decompress any substring\nof length $m$ in the same complexity as a single random access query and\nadditional $O(m)$ time. Combining these results with fast algorithms for\nuncompressed approximate string matching leads to several efficient algorithms\nfor approximate string matching on grammar-compressed strings without\ndecompression. For instance, we can find all approximate occurrences of a\npattern $P$ with at most $k$ errors in time $O(n(\\min\\{|P|k, k^4 + |P|\\} + \\log\nN) + occ)$, where $occ$ is the number of occurrences of $P$ in $S$.

The focus of this paper is its dynamic (stochastic)\nversion, the Glauber dynamics, introduced in 1963 and by now the most popular\nmeans of sampling the Ising measure. Intensive study throughout the last three\ndecades has yielded a rigorous understanding of the spectral-gap of the\ndynamics on $\\Z^2$ everywhere except at criticality. While the critical\nbehavior of the Ising model has long been the focus for physicists,\nmathematicians have only recently developed an understanding of its critical\ngeometry with the advent of SLE, CLE and new tools to study conformally\ninvariant systems.\n  A rich interplay exists between the static and dynamic models. At the static\nphase-transition for Ising, the dynamics is conjectured to undergo a critical\nslowdown: At high temperature the inverse-gap is O(1), at the critical\n$\\beta_c$ it is polynomial in the side-length and at low temperature it is\nexponential in it. A seminal series of papers verified this on $\\Z^2$ except at\n$\\beta=\\beta_c$ where the behavior remained a challenging open problem.\n  Here we establish the first rigorous polynomial upper bound for the critical\nmixing, thus confirming the critical slowdown for the Ising model in $\\Z^2$.\nNamely, we show that on a finite box with arbitrary (e.g. fixed, free,\nperiodic) boundary conditions, the inverse-gap at $\\beta=\\beta_c$ is polynomial\nin the side-length. The proof harnesses recent understanding of the scaling\nlimit of critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the Ising model together\nwith classical tools from the analysis of Markov chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 20:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:06:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2010 01:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2010 16:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-09"}

It is found that the Langmuir wave electric field, indeed, increases\nby the effect of ion-wave nonlinearity (IWN). Use of a low-dimensional model,\nbased on three Fourier modes shows that a transition to temporal chaos is\npossible, when the length scale of the linearly excited modes is larger than\nthat of the most unstable ones. The chaotic behaviors of the unstable modes are\nidentified by the analysis of Lyapunov exponent spectra. The space-time\nevolution of the coupled LWs and IAWs shows that the IWN can cause the\nexcitation of many unstable harmonic modes, and can lead to strong IAW\nemission. This occurs when the initial wave field is relatively large or the\nlength scale of IAWs is larger than the soliton characteristic size. Numerical\nsimulation also reveals that many solitary patterns can be excited and\ngenerated through the modulational instability (MI) of unstable harmonic modes.\nAs time goes on, these solitons are seen to appear in the spatially partial\ncoherence (SPC) state due to the free ion-acoustic radiation as well as in the\nstate of spatiotemporal chaos (STC) due to collision and fusion in the\nstochastic motion. The latter results the redistribution of initial wave energy\ninto a few modes with small length scales, which may lead to the onset of\nLangmuir turbulence in laboratory as well as space plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 16:09:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 18:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}

We model the coupling of the\nqubit to its environment via the Caldeira-Leggett formulation of quantum\ndissipation/coherence, and study the simplest example of decoherence effects in\ncircuits with resonances such as a dc SQUID phase qubit in the presence of an\nisolation circuit, which is designed to enhance the coherence time. We\nemphasize that the spectral density of the environment is strongly dependent on\nthe circuit design, and can be engineered to produce longer decoherence times.\nWe begin with a general discussion of superconducting qubits such as the flux\nqubit, the Cooper pair box and the phase qubit and show that in these kinds of\nsystems appropriate circuit design can greatly modify the spectral density of\nthe environment and lead to enhancement of decoherence times. In the particular\ncase of the phase qubit, for instance, we show that when the frequency of the\nqubit is at least two times larger than the resonance frequency of the\nenvironmental spectral density, the decoherence time of the qubit is a few\norders of magnitude larger than that of the typical ohmic regime, where the\nfrequency of the qubit is much smaller than the resonance frequency of the\nspectral density. In addition, we demonstrate that the environment does not\nonly affect the decoherence time, but also the frequency of the transition\nitself, which is shifted from its environment-free value. Second, we show that\nwhen the qubit frequency is nearly the same as the resonant frequency of the\nenvironmental spectral density, an oscillatory non-Markovian decay emerges, as\nthe qubit and its environment self-generate Rabi oscillations of characteristic\ntime scales shorter than the decoherence time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 17:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2010 15:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-07"}

The\nabsolute highest density of equal spheres in three dimensions is the\ntetrahedron formed by the centers of four spheres touching each other with\ndensity of 0.7796.

It is thus reasonable to expect statistical\nisotropy violation in the CMB photon distribution observed now to have\noriginated from SI violation in the baryon-photon fluid at last scattering, in\naddition to anisotropy of the primordial power spectrum studied earlier in\nliterature.\n  We consider the generalized anisotropic brightness distribution fluctuations,\n$\\Delta(\\vec{k}, \\hat{n}, \\tau)$ (at conformal time $\\tau$) in contrast to the\nSI case where it is simply a function of $|\\vec{k}|$ and $\\hat{k} \\cdot\n\\hat{n}$.

Here we examine phenomenological models of quenching by\npost-processing the star formation histories of galaxies from cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations that reproduce observations of star-forming galaxies\nreasonably well. We consider recipes for quenching based on major mergers, halo\nmass thresholds, gas temperature thresholds, and variants thereof. We compare\nthe resulting simulated star formation histories to observed g-r\ncolour-magnitude diagrams and red and blue luminosity functions from SDSS. The\nmerger and halo mass quenching scenarios each yield a distinct red sequence and\nblue cloud of galaxies that are in broad agreement with data, albeit only under\nrather extreme assumptions. In detail, however, the simulated red sequence\nslope and amplitude in each scenario is somewhat discrepant, perhaps traceable\nto low metallicities in simulated galaxies. Merger quenching produces more\nmassive blue galaxies, earlier quenching, and more frosting of young stars;\ncomparing to relevant data tends to favor merger over halo mass quenching.\nAlthough physically-motivated quenching models can produce a red sequence,\ninteresting generic discrepancies remain that indicate that additional physics\nis required to reproduce the star formation and enrichment histories of red and\ndead galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2010 23:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The fraction\nof barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific star\nformation rate (SSFR). At intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 < M < 10^11 Msun)\nthe bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by a\nfactor ~2, than that in late-type disks. This trend is reversed at higher\nstellar mass (M > 10^11 Msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disks\nbecomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.\nThe bar fractions for galaxies with low and high SSFRs closely follow those of\nthe morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,\nrespectively. This indicates a close correspondence between morphology and SSFR\nin disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. Interestingly, the total bar fraction\nin 10^10.5 < M < 10^11 Msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over the\nredshift interval explored, while for M > 10^11 Msun disks it remains roughly\nconstant.

Finally, the\nevolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on the\nlarge-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probed\nwith the available photometric redshifts).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 21:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 19:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

However, inferences about galaxy\npopulation properties are in practice limited by 'cosmic variance'. This is the\nuncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies\narising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of\nuncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small\nareas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given\ngalaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter\ntheory and the galaxy bias. In this paper we provide tools for experiment\ndesign and interpretation. For a given survey geometry we present the cosmic\nvariance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z and redshift bin size\nDz. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the\ngalaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given\nstellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy\nsamples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance.\nWe present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance\nas a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z, Dz and stellar mass\nm*. We also provide tabulated values and a software tool. We find that for\nGOODS at z=2 and with Dz=0.5 the relative cosmic variance of galaxies with\nm*>10^11 Msun is ~38%, while it is ~27% for GEMS and ~12% for COSMOS. For\ngalaxies of m*~10^10 Msun the relative cosmic variance is ~19% for GOODS, ~13%\nfor GEMS and ~6% for COSMOS. This implies that cosmic variance is a significant\nsource of uncertainty at z=2 for small fields and massive galaxies, while for\nlarger fields and intermediate mass galaxies cosmic variance is less serious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 21:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

In this paper we examine how properties such as the\ncolour magnitude relation, structure and morphology are affected by environment\nfor the lowest mass galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are excellent tracers of the\neffects of environment due to their low masses, allowing us to derive their\nenvironmentally based evolution, which is more subtle in more massive galaxies.\nWe identify 11 dwarf elliptical (dE) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in\nthe outer regions of Perseus, all of which are previously unstudied. We measure\nthe (V-I)_0 colours of our newly discovered dEs, and find that these dwarfs lie\non the same red sequence as those in the cluster core. The morphologies of\nthese dwarfs are examined by quantifying their light distributions using CAS\nparameters, and we find that dEs in the cluster outskirts are on average more\ndisturbed than those in the core, with <A> =0.13\\pm0.09 and <S> =0.18\\pm0.08,\ncompared to <A> =0.02\\pm0.04, <S> =0.01\\pm0.07 for those in the core. Based on\nthese results, we infer that these objects are ``transition dwarfs'', likely in\nthe process of transforming from late-type to early type galaxies as they\ninfall into the cluster, with their colours transforming before their\nstructures. When we compare the number counts for both the core and outer\nregions of the cluster, we find that below M_V = -12, the counts in the outer\nregions of the cluster exceed those in the core. This is evidence that in the\nvery dense region of the cluster, dwarfs are unable to survive unless they are\nsufficiently massive to prevent their disruption by the cluster potential and\ninteractions with other galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 22:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 15:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We provide analyses of the formation rates\nvia well known formation channels like binary exchange and physical collisions\nand propose that the only possibility to form BH-WD binaries is via coupling\nthese usual formation channels with subsequent hardening and/or triple\nformation. Indeed, we find that the most important mechanism to make a BH-WD\nX-ray binary from an initially dynamically formed BH-WD binary is triple\ninduced mass transfer via the Kozai mechanism. Even using the most optimistic\nestimates for the formation rates, we cannot match the observationally inferred\nproduction rates if black holes undergo significant evaporation from the\ncluster or form a completely detached subcluster of black holes. We estimate\nthat at least 1% of all formed black holes, or presumably 10% of the black\nholes present in the core now, must be involved in interactions with the rest\nof the core stellar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 23:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We have derived scalings of physical quantities with loop length,\nand the ratio of photospheric to coronal Alfven velocities. The development of\na turbulent dynamics makes the dissipation rate independent of the Reynolds\nnumber. The dynamics in physical space are desribed by weak turbulence, which\ndevelops when an MHD system is embedded in a strong axial magnetic field.\n  The slow wind originates in and around the coronal streamer belt.

It is found that the magnetized wake configuration is resistively\nunstable, that an outward accelerating magnetic island develops at the center\nof the streamer, and that density enhancements occur within the magnetic\nislands. The values of the acceleration and density contrasts can be in good\nagreement with LASCO observations, provided the spherical divergence of the\nmagnetic lines starts beyond a critical distance from the Sun.

As the baryon-to-photon ratio becomes larger, the primordial\nhelium abundance is enhanced. We calculated the big bang nucleosynthesis and\nfound that there exists a parameter region yielding enough helium to account\nfor the split of the main sequence in the aforementioned globular clusters\nwhile keeping the abundances of other elements compatible with observations.\nOur mechanism predicts that heavy elements with the mass number of around 100\nis enhanced in the blue main sequence stars. We estimate the timescales of\ndiffusion of the enhanced helium and mass accretion in several stages after the\nnucleosynthesis to investigate whether these processes diminish the enhancement\nof helium. We found that the diffusion does not influence the helium content. A\ncloud with a sufficiently large baryon-to-photon ratio to account for the\nmultiple main sequence collapsed immediately after the recombination.\nSubsequently, the cloud accreted the ambient matter with the normal helium\ncontent.

Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed\nto date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of\nconvolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism which\nexplains why \"convolutional-like\" or \"spatially coupled\" codes perform so well.\nIn essence, the spatial coupling of the individual code structure has the\neffect of increasing the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble\nto its maximum possible value, namely the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold\nof the underlying ensemble. For this reason we call this phenomenon \"threshold\nsaturation.\" This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One\nsignificant advantage of such a construction is that one can create\ncapacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius which is\nincreasing in the blocklength. Our proof makes use of the area theorem of the\nBP-EXIT curve and the connection between the MAP and BP threshold recently\npointed out by Measson, Montanari, Richardson, and Urbanke. Although we prove\nthe connection between the MAP and the BP threshold only for a very specific\nensemble and only for the binary erasure channel, empirically a threshold\nsaturation phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More\ngenerally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar\nsaturation of the \"dynamical\" threshold occurs once individual components are\ncoupled sufficiently strongly.

The science\ndrivers are the determination of the physical properties of stars and the\ncharacterisation of planets orbiting them, to very high precision. PHASES,\nintended to be housed in a micro-satellite, consists of a 20 cm aperture\nmodified Baker telescope feeding two detectors: the tracking detector, with a\nfield of 1 degree square, and the science detector for performing\nspectrophotometry. The optical design has been developed with the primary goal\nof avoiding stray light on the science detector, while providing spectra in the\nwavelength range 370-960 nm with a resolving power that ranges from ~900 at 370\nnm to ~200 at 960 nm. The signal to noise per resolution element obtained for a\nV=10 magnitude star in a 1 minute integration varies between ~ 35 and 140.

The transition from \\beta=0 to \\beta\\to\\infty includes all the\npossible forms of MRI with axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes. For the\nnonaxisymmetric modes, the most unstable mode spirals in the opposite direction\nto the background field. The standard (\\beta=0) MRI is axisymmetric for weak\nfields (including the instability with the lowest Reynolds number) but is\nnonaxisymmetric for stronger fields. If the azimuthal field is due in part to\nan axial current flowing through the fluid itself (and not just along the\ncentral axis), then it is also unstable to the nonaxisymmetric Tayler\ninstability, which is most effective without rotation. For large \\beta this\ninstability has wavenumber m=1, whereas for \\beta\\simeq 1 m=2 is most unstable.\nThe most unstable mode spirals in the same direction as the background field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 15:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

To\nbe able to deal with potential high dimensions, we provide a procedure called\nLOL, for Learning Out of Leaders with no optimization step. LOL is an\nauto-driven algorithm with two thresholding steps. A first adaptive\nthresholding helps to select leaders among the initial regressors in order to\nobtain a first reduction of dimensionality. Then a second thresholding is\nperformed on the linear regression upon the leaders. The consistency of the\nprocedure is investigated. Exponential bounds are obtained, leading to minimax\nand adaptive results for a wide class of sparse parameters, with (quasi) no\nrestriction on the number p of possible regressors. An extensive computational\nexperiment is conducted to emphasize the practical good performances of LOL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 15:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 11:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-24"}

Doppler\nvelocities both in the macrospicule and the coronal jet are determined by EIS\nand SUMER spectra. Their temporal evolution is studied using X-ray and He II\n304 images. A blueshift of -120+/-15 km/s is detected on one side of the\nmacrospicule, while a redshift of 50+/-6 km/s is found at the base of the other\nside. The inclination angle of the macrospicule inferred from a stereoscopic\nanalysis with STEREO suggests that the measured Doppler velocities can be\nattributed to a rotating motion of the macrospicule rather than a radial flow\nor an expansion. The macrospicule is driven by the unfolding motion of a\ntwisted magnetic flux rope, while the associated X-ray jet is a radial outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 15:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-09"}

In this work, the\nanyons are pinned to precise spatial configurations by using specific external\npotentials. Such external potentials break the translational symmetry and it\nappears that one will be forced to simulate the braidings on the entire\nmany-body Hilbert space, an absolutely prohibitive scenario. We demonstrate how\nto overcome this difficulty and obtain the exact braidings for fairly large\nHall systems. For this, we show that the incompressible state of a general\n$(k,m)$ fractional Hall sequence can be viewed as the unique zero mode of a\nspecific Hamiltonian $H^{(k,m)}$, whose form is explicitly derived by using\nk-particles creation operators. The compressible Hall states corresponding to\n$n$$\\times$$k$ anyons fixed at $w_1$,...,$w_{nk}$ are shown to be the zero\nmodes of a pinning Hamiltonian $H^{(k,m)}_{w_1,...,w_{nk}}$, which is also\nexplicitly derived. The zero modes of $H^{(k,m)}_{w_1,...,w_{nk}}$ are shown to\nbe contained in the space of the zero modes of $H^{(k,m)}$. Therefore, the\ncomputation of the braidings can be done entirely within this space, which we\nmap out for a number of Hall systems. Using this efficient computational\nmethod, we study various properties of the Moore-Read states. In particular, we\ngive direct confirmation of their topological and non-abelian properties that\nwere previously implied from the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT)\nstructure of the Moore-Read state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 15:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-13"}
