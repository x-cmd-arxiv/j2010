The Normal Branch is\ndominated by the increasing radiation pressure of the neutron star caused by a\nmass accretion rate that increases between the soft apex and the hard apex. The\nradiation pressure continues to increase on the Horizontal Branch becoming\nseveral times super-Eddington. We suggest that this disrupts the inner\naccretion disk and that part of the accretion flow is diverted vertically\nforming jets which are detected by their radio emission on this part of the\nZ-track. We thus propose that high radiation pressure is the necessary\ncondition for the launching of jets. On the Flaring Branch there is a large\nincrease in the neutron star blackbody luminosity at constant mass accretion\nrate indicating an additional energy source on the neutron star. We find that\nthere is good agreement between the mass accretion rate per unit emitting area\nof the neutron star mdot at the onset of flaring and the theoretical critical\nvalue at which burning becomes unstable. We thus propose that flaring in the\nCygnusX-2 like sources consists of unstable nuclear burning. Correlation of\nmeasurements of kilohertz QPO frequencies in all three sources with spectral\nfitting results leads to the proposal that the upper kHz QPO is an oscillation\nalways taking place at the inner accretion disk edge, the radius of which\nincreases due to disruption of the disk by the high radiation pressure of the\nneutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 19:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Our goal is to model the cluster population as\nwell as provide rough constraints on its initial mass function (IMF). The\ncluster shows signs of youth such as thermal radio emission and strong hydrogen\nemission lines in the near-infrared. Late-type absorption lines are also\npresent which are indicative of late-type stars in the cluster. The strength\nand ratio of these absorption lines cannot be reproduced through either\nlate-type pre-main sequence (PMS) stars or red supergiants alone. Thus we\ninterpret the spectrum as a superposition of two star clusters of different\nages, which is feasible since the 1\" spectrum encompasses a physical region of\n~90 pc and radii of super-star clusters are generally measured to be a few\nparsecs. One cluster is young (<= 3 Myr) and is responsible for part of the\nlate-type absorption features, which are due to PMS stars in the cluster, and\nthe hydrogen emission lines. The second cluster is older (6 Myr - 18 Myr) and\nis needed to reproduce the overall depth of the late-type absorption features\nin the spectrum. Both are required to accurately reproduce the near-infrared\nspectrum of the object. Thus we have directly detected PMS objects in an\nunresolved super-star cluster for the first time using a combination of\npopulation synthesis models and pre-main sequence tracks.

Understanding the complex kinematic phenomena can\npossibly provide insights into the differences between quasars and BL Lac\nobjects. The blazar S5 1803+784 has been studied with VLBI at $\\nu$ =1.6, 2.3,\n5, 8.4, and 15 GHz between 1993.88 and 2005.68 in 26 observing runs. We\n(re)analyzed the data and present Gaussian model-fits. We collected the already\npublished kinematic information for this source from the literature and\nre-identified the components according to the new scenario presented in this\npaper. Altogether, 94 epochs of observations have been investigated. A careful\nstudy of the long-term kinematics reveals a new picture for component motion in\nS5 1803+784. In contrast to previously discussed motion scenarios, we find that\nthe jet structure within 12 mas of the core can most easily be described by the\ncoexistence of several bright jet features that remain on the long-term at\nroughly constant core separations (in addition to the already known {\\it\nstationary} jet component $\\sim$ 1.4 mas) and one faint component moving with\nan apparent superluminal speed ($\\sim$ 19c, based on 3 epochs). While most of\nthe components maintain long-term roughly constant distances from the core, we\nobserve significant, smooth changes in their position angles. We report on an\nevolution of the whole jet ridge line with time over the almost 12 years of\nobservations. The width of the jet changes periodically with a period of $\\sim$\n8 to 9 years. We find a correlation between changes in the position angle and\nmaxima in the total flux-density. We present evidence for a geometric origin of\nthe phenomena and discuss possible models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 18:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Starting from the\nbound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we derive relativistic\nlight-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable zeta which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical space-time are\nequivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J\nmodes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic\nspectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distributions of the\nhadronic constituents at a given scale. Applications to the light meson and\nbaryon spectra are presented. The predicted meson spectrum has a string-theory\nRegge form ${\\cal M}^2 = 4 \\kappa^2(n+L+S/2)$; i.e., the square of the\neigenmass is linear in both L and n, where n counts the number of nodes of the\nwavefunction in the radial variable zeta. The space-like pion and nucleon form\nfactors are also well reproduced. One thus obtains a remarkable connection\nbetween the description of hadronic modes in AdS space and the Hamiltonian\nformulation of QCD in physical space-time quantized on the light-front at fixed\nlight-front time. The model can be systematically improved by using its\ncomplete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front\nHamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method in order to\nsystematically include the QCD interaction terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 18:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 23:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

From this result, we infer that over this redshift\nrange galaxy-galaxy interactions, which are more effective in lower-sigma\nenvironments, are more responsible for transforming spiral galaxies into S0's\nthan galaxy-environment processes, which are more effective in higher-sigma\nenvironments. The rapid, recent growth of the S0 population in groups and poor\nclusters implies that large numbers of progenitors exist in low-sigma systems\nat modest redshifts (~ 0.5), where morphologies and internal kinematics are\nwithin the measurement range of current technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2010 21:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The\nclusters are formed following a cluster initial mass function (CMF) similar to\nthe stellar initial mass function (IMF). Both the IMF and the CMF favour\nlow-mass objects. The numerous low-mass clusters will lack high mass stars. If\nthe integrated galactic initial mass function originates from stars formed in\nclusters, the IGIMF could be steeper than the IMF. We investigate how well\nconstrained this steepening is and how it depends on the choice of sampling\nmethod and CMF. We compare analytic sampling to several implementations of\nrandom sampling of the IMF, and different CMFs. We implement different IGIMFs\ninto GALEV to obtain colours and metallicities for galaxies. Choosing different\nways of sampling the IMF results in different IGIMFs. Depending on the lower\ncluster mass limit and the slope of the cluster mass function, the steepening\nvaries between very strong and negligible. We find the size of the effect is\ncontinuous as a function of the power-law slope of the CMF, if the CMF extends\nto masses smaller than the maximum stellarmass. The number of O-stars detected\nby GAIA might help in judging on the importance of the IGIMF effect. The impact\nof different IGIMFs on integrated galaxy photometry is small, within the\nintrinsic scatter of observed galaxies. Observations of gas fractions and\nmetallicities could rule out at least the most extreme sampling methods. As we\nstill do not understand the details of star formation, one sampling method\ncannot be favoured over another. Also, the CMF at very low cluster masses is\nnot well constrained observationally. These uncertainties need to be taken into\naccount when using an IGIMF, with severe implications for galaxy evolution\nmodels and interpretations of galaxy observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 09:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-31"}

Users are asynchronous meaning\nthere exists a mutual delay between their transmitted codes. A stationary model\nfor interference is considered by assuming the starting point of an\ninterferer's data is uniformly distributed along the codeword of any user. This\nmodel is not ergodic, however, we show that the noise plus interference process\nsatisfies an Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) under certain conditions.\nThis enables us to define achievable rates in the conventional Shannon sense.\nThe spectrum is divided to private and common bands. Each user occupies its\nassigned private band and the common band upon activation. In a scenario where\nall transmitters are unaware of the number of active users and the channel\ngains, the optimum spectrum assignment is obtained such that the so-called\noutage capacity per user is maximized. If $\\Pr\\{\\mathbf{n}>2\\}>0$, all users\nfollow a locally Randomized On-Off signaling scheme on the common band where\neach transmitter quits transmitting its Gaussian signals independently from\ntransmission to transmission. Achievable rates are developed using a\nconditional version of Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) and an upper bound on the\ndifferential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random variable.

We argue that for blazar variability studies, the SF\nresults are sometimes erroneously interpreted leading to misconceptions about\nthe actual source properties. Based on extensive simulations we caution that\nspurious breaks will appear in the SFs of almost all light curves, even though\nthese light curves may contain no intrinsic characteristic time-scales. i.e.\nhaving a featureless underlying power-spectral-density (PSD). We show that the\ntime-scales of the spurious SF-breaks depend mainly on the length of the\nartificial data set and also on the character of the variability i.e. the shape\nof the PSD. The SF is often invoked in the framework of shot-noise models to\ndetermine the temporal properties of individual shots. We caution that although\nthe SF may be fitted to infer the shot parameters, the resultant shot-noise\nmodel is usually inconsistent with the observed PSD. As any model should fit\nthe data in both the time and the frequency domain the shot-noise model, in\nthese particular cases, can not be valid. Moreover, we show that the lack of\nstatistical independence between adjacent SF points, in the standard SF\nformulation, means that it is not possible to perform robust statistical model\nfitting following the commonly used least-squares fitting methodology. The\nlatter yields uncertainties in the fitting parameters (i.e. slopes, breaks)\nthat are far too small with respect to their true statistical scatter. Finally,\nit is also commonly thought that SFs are immune to the sampling problems, such\nas data gaps, which affects the estimators of the PSDs. However we show that\nSFs are also troubled by gaps which can induce artefacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 00:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

White phase noise results from adding white noise to the RF\nspectrum around the carrier. For a given amount of RF noise added, noise is\nproportional to the inverse of the carrier power. By contrast, the 1/f\ncoefficient is a constant parameter of the amplifier, in a wide range of\ncarrier power. This fact has amazing consequences on different amplifier\ntopologies. Connecting m equal amplifiers in parallel, flicker is 1/m times\nthat of one device. Cascading m equal amplifiers, flicker is m times that of\none amplifier. Recirculating the signal in an amplifier so that the gain\nincreases by a power of m (a factor of m in dB) due to positive feedback\n(regeneration), which for integer m is similar to the case of m amplifiers, we\nfind that flicker is m^2 times that of the amplifier alone.\n  Starting from the fact that near-dc flicker exists in all electronic devices,\nalthough generally not accessible from outside, the simplest model for the 1/f\nphase noise is that the near-dc 1/f noise phase-modulates the carrier through\nsome parametric effect in the semiconductor. This model predicts the behavior\nof the (simple) amplifier and of the different amplifier topologies. Numerous\nmeasurements on amplifiers from different technologies and frequencies (HF to\nmicrowaves), also including some obsolete amplifiers, validate the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 10:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 14:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

As the simplest silicates,\nunderstanding pure silica is a prerequisite to understanding the rocky part of\nthe Earth, its majority. First principle density functional theory (DFT)\nmethods have often been used to accurately predict properties of silicates.\nHere, we study silica with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), which until now was not\ncomputationally possible for such complex materials, and find that QMC\novercomes the failures of DFT. QMC is a benchmark method that does not rely on\ndensity functionals, but rather explicitly treats the electrons and their\ninteractions via a stochastic solution of Schrodinger's equation. Using ground\nstate QMC plus phonons within the quasiharmonic approximation from density\nfunctional perturbation theory, we obtain the thermal pressure and equations of\nstate of silica phases up to Earth's core-mantle boundary. Our results provide\nthe most well-constrained equations of state and phase boundaries available for\nsilica. QMC indicates a transition to the most dense alpha-PbO2 structure above\nthe core-insulating D\" layer, suggesting the absence of significant free silica\nin the bulk lower mantle, which has been assumed but never proven. We also find\nan accurate shear elastic constant and its geophysically important softening\nwith pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 02:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-02"}

When the turbulence\namplitude exceeds a certain threshold, an ion's orbit becomes chaotic. The ion\nthen interacts stochastically with the time-varying electrostatic potential,\nand the ion's energy undergoes a random walk. Using phenomenological arguments,\nwe derive an analytic expression for the rates at which different ion species\nare heated, which we test by simulating test particles interacting with a\nspectrum of randomly phased AWs and KAWs. We find that the stochastic heating\nrate depends sensitively on the quantity epsilon = dv/vperp, where vperp is the\ncomponent of the ion velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic field\nB0, and dv (dB) is the rms amplitude of the velocity (magnetic-field)\nfluctuations at the gyroradius scale. In the case of thermal protons, when\nepsilon << eps1, where eps1 is a constant, a proton's magnetic moment is nearly\nconserved and stochastic heating is extremely weak. However, when epsilon >\neps1, the proton heating rate exceeds the cascade power that would be present\nin strong balanced KAW turbulence with the same value of dv, and\nmagnetic-moment conservation is violated. For the random-phase waves in our\ntest-particle simulations, eps1 is approximately 0.2. For protons in low-beta\nplasmas, epsilon is approximately dB/B0 divided by the square root of beta, and\nepsilon can exceed eps1 even when dB/B0 << eps1. At comparable temperatures,\nalpha particles and minor ions have larger values of epsilon than protons and\nare heated more efficiently as a result. We discuss the implications of our\nresults for ion heating in coronal holes and the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 15:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

For\nthis purpose, traditional integral viscosity measurements on a Muenstedt type\nextensional rheometer are combined with local mea- surements based on the\nin-situ visualization of the sample under exten- sion. For elongational\nexperiments at constant strain rates within a wide range of Weissenberg numbers\n(Wi), three distinct deformation regimes are identified. Corresponding to low\nvalues of Wi (regime I), the tensile stress displays a broad maximum. This\nmaximum can be explained by simple mathematical arguments as a result of low\ndeformation rates and it should not be confused with the viscosity overshoot\nphenomenon. Corre- sponding to intermediate values of Wi (regime II), a local\nmaximum of the integral extensional viscosity is systematically observed.\nHowever, within this regime, the local viscosity measurements reveal no\nmaximum, but a plateau. Careful inspection of the images of samples within this\nregime shows that, corresponding to the maximum of the integral viscosity, sec-\nondary necks develop along the sample. The emergence of a maximum of the\nintegral elongational viscosity is thus related to the distinct in- homogeneity\nof deformation states and is not related to the rheological properties of the\nmaterial. In the fast stretching limit (high Wi, regime III), the overall\ngeometric uniformity of the sample is well preserved, no secondary necks are\nobserved and both the integral and the local transient elongational viscosity\nshow no maximum. A detailed comparison of the experimental findings with\nresults from literature is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 07:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-14"}

This object is an\nintra-day variable source and suited to investigate a possible correlation\nbetween kinematic properties and flux-density variability on different\ntimescales. We (re-)analyze 50 VLBI observations obtained with the VLBA at 5\ndifferent frequencies (5 to 43 GHz) between 1992.73 and 2006.32. We analyze the\njet component motion in detail taking care not only to account for motion in\nthe radial but also in the orthogonal direction. We study the evolution of the\njet ridge line and search for correlations between radio band light curves and\nthe kinematic properties of the jet components. We present an alternative\nkinematic scenario for jet component motion in S5 0716+714 with apparent\nstationarity of jet components (with regard to their core separation) with\ntime. Jet components, however, do seem to move significantly non-radially with\nregard to their position angle and in a direction perpendicular to the major\naxis of the jet. We discuss a possible correlation between the long-term radio\nflux-density variability and the kinematics. We conclude that a geometric\ncontribution to the origin of the long-term variability might not be\nnegligible. Subluminal motion has been reported for most of the TeV blazars.\nOur analysis also confirms this for S5 0716+714. This result increases the\nnumber of TeV blazars showing apparent subluminal motion to 7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 10:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-14"}

This\nmay indicate that complex geometries may be a key feature in disk evolution\nthat has to be understood and modeled correctly. The disk around LkCa 15 is\nsuch a disk, with a gap ranging from ~5 - 50 AU, as identified by Espaillat et\nal. (2007) using 1+1D radiative transfer modelling. To fit the SED, they\npropose 2 possible scenarios for the inner (<5 AU) disk - optically thick or\noptically thin - and one scenario for the outer disk. We use the gapped disk of\nLkCa 15 as a showcase to illustrate the importance of 2D radiative transfer in\ntransitional disks, by showing how the vertical dust distribution in\ndust-filled inner holes determines not only the radial optical depth but also\nthe outer disk geometry. We use MCMax, a 2D radiative transfer code with a\nself-consistent vertical structure, to model the SED. We identify two possible\ngeometries for the inner and outer disk, that are both different from those in\nEspaillat et al. (2007). An inner disk in hydrostatic equilibrium reprocesses\nenough starlight to fit the near infrared flux, but also casts a shadow on the\ninner rim of the outer disk. This requires the outer disk scale height to be\nlarge enough to rise out of the shadow. An optically thin inner disk does not\ncast such a shadow, and the SED can be fitted with a smaller outer disk scale\nheight. For the dust in the inner regions to become optically thin however, the\nscale height would have to be so much larger than its hydrostatic equilibrium\nvalue that it effectively becomes a dust shell. It is currently unclear if a\nphysical mechanism exists which could provide for such a configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 13:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2010 15:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

Two solvents are used: (i) one\nmixture of water and an organic solvent: THF, which is also slightly polar;\n(ii) DMSO, a polar organic solvent. In case (i), it is shown by SAXS study that\nthe structure - namely the scattering from all chains, characterised by a\nmaximum (\"polyelectrolyte peak\"), of the aqueous hydrophobic polyelectrolyte\nsolutions (PSS) depends on the solvent quality through the added amount of\norganic solvent THF. This dependence is more pronounced when the sulfonation\nrate is low (more hydrophobic polyelectrolyte). It is proposed that when THF is\nadded, the chain conformation evolves from the pearl necklace shape already\nreported in pure water, towards the conformation in pure water for fully\nsulfonated PSS, which is string-like as also reported previously. On the\ncontrary, for a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte, AMAMPS, no evolution occurs with\nadded THF in the aqueous solution. In case (ii), it is shown directly by SANS\nstudy that PSS can behave as a classical solvophilic polyelectrolyte when\ndissolved in an organic polar solvent such as DMSO: the structure (total\nscattering) as well as the form factor (single chain scattering measured by\nSANS using the Zero Average Contrast method) of the PSS chains is independent\nof the charge content in agreement with Manning condensation, and identical to\nthe one of a fully charged PSS chain in pure water, which has a classical\npolyelectrolyte behaviour in the semi-dilute regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 13:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-27"}

The features of the ignition\nare among the few free parameters of the SN Ia explosion theory. We explore the\nrole for the ignition process of two different issues: firstly, the ignition is\nstudied in WD models coming from different accretion histories. Secondly, we\nestimate how a different reaction rate for C-burning can affect the ignition.\nTwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of temperature perturbations in the\nWD core (\"bubbles\") are performed with the FLASH code. In order to evaluate the\nimpact of the C-burning reaction rate on the WD model, the evolution code\nFLASH_THE_TORTOISE from Lesaffre et al. (2006) is used. In different WD models\na key role is played by the different gravitational acceleration in the\nprogenitor's core. As a consequence, the ignition is disfavored at a large\ndistance from the WD center in models with a larger central density, resulting\nfrom the evolution of initially more massive progenitors. Changes in the C\nreaction rate at T < 5e8 K slightly influence the ignition density in the WD\ncore, while the ignition temperature is almost unaffected. Recent measurements\nof new resonances in the C-burning reaction rate (Spillane et al. 2007) do not\naffect the core conditions of the WD significantly. This simple analysis,\nperformed on the features of the temperature perturbations in the WD core,\nshould be extended in the framework of the state-of-the-art numerical tools for\nstudying the turbulent convection and ignition in the WD core. Future\nmeasurements of the C-burning reactions cross section at low energy, though\ncertainly useful, are not expected to affect dramatically our current\nunderstanding of the ignition process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 13:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-09"}

However, it is not clear whether the presence of\ndiffuse dust can play a role in clusters physics since a characterisation of\nthe IR properties of galaxy clusters is yet to be completely achieved. We focus\non the recent work of Giard et al. (2008) who performed a stacking analysis of\nthe IRAS data in the direction of several thousands of galaxy clusters,\nproviding a statistical characterisation of their IR luminosity and redshift\nevolution. We model the IR properties of the galactic population of the\nSDSS-maxBCG clusters (0.1<z<0.3) in order to check if it accounts for the\nentire observed signal and to constrain the possible presence of other\ncomponents, like dust in the ICM. Starting from the optical properties of the\ngalaxy members, we estimate their emission in the 60 and 100 micron IRAS bands\nmaking use of modeled SEDs of different spectral types (E/S0, Sa, Sb, Sc and\nstarburst). We also consider the evolution of the galactic\npopulation/luminosity with redshift. Our results indicate that the galactic\nemission, which is dominated by the contribution of star-forming galaxies, is\nconsistent with the observed signal. In fact, our model slightly overestimates\nthe observed fluxes, with the excess being concentrated in low-redshift\nclusters (z <~ 0.17). This indicates that, if present, the IR emission from\nintracluster dust must be very small. We obtain an upper limit on the\ndust-to-gas mass ratio in the ICM of Z_d <~ 5 10^-5. The excess in luminosity\nobtained at low redshift constitutes an indication that the cluster environment\nis driving a process of star-formation quenching in its galaxy members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 14:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Simulation runs with\ndifferent magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) are used together with observations at\ndifferent heliocentric angles with different levels of noise. The results show\nthat simulations with an imposed mixed-polarity field and Rm below the\nthreshold for dynamo action reproduce the observed vertical flux density, but\ndo not display a sufficiently high horizontal flux density. Surface dynamo\nsimulations at the highest Rm feasible at the moment yield a ratio of the\nhorizontal and vertical flux density consistent with observational results, but\nthe overall amplitudes are too low. Based on the properties of the local dynamo\nsimulations, a tentative scaling of the magnetic field strength by a factor 2 -\n3 reproduces the signal observed in the internetwork regions. We find an\nagreement with observations at different heliocentric angles. The mean field\nstrength in internetwork, implied by our analysis, is roughly 170 G at the\noptical depth unity.

Our CO observation obtained with the Purple\nMountain Observatory at Delingha reveals that the remnant is well confined in a\ncavity of molecular gas, and embedded at the edge of a molecular cloud (MC) at\nthe local standard of rest systemic velocity of ~32 km/s. The cloud has a\ncolumn density gradient increasing from southeast to northwest, perpendicular\nto the Galactic plane, in agreement with the elongation direction of the\nremnant. This systemic velocity places the cloud and SNR 3C 397 at a kinematic\ndistance of ~10.3 kpc. The derived mean molecular density (~10-30 cm^-3)\nexplains the high volume emission measure of the X-ray emitting gas. A 12CO\nline broadening of the ~32 km/s component is detected at the westmost boundary\nof the remnant, which provides direct evidence of the SNR-MC interaction and\nsuggests multi-component gas there with dense (~10^4 cm^-3) molecular clumps.\nWe confirm the previous detection of a MC at ~38 km/s to the west and south of\nthe SNR and argue, based on HI self-absorption, that the cloud is located in\nthe foreground of the remnant. A list of Galactic SNRs presently known and\nsuggested to be in physical contact with environmental MCs is appended in this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 15:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 06:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2010 15:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
