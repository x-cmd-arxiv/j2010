The action for the\nvector is U(1) invariant, and the model is free of ghost instabilities. A\nsuitable coupling of the scalar to the kinetic term of the vector allows for a\nslow roll evolution of the vector vev, and hence for a prolonged anisotropic\nexpansion; this provides a counter example to the cosmic no hair conjecture. We\ncompute the nonvanishing two point correlation functions between physical modes\nof the system, and express them in terms of power spectra with angular\ndependence. The anisotropy parameter g_* for the scalar-scalar spectrum\n(defined as in the Ackerman et al '07 parametrization) turns out to be negative\nin the simplest realization of the model, which, therefore, cannot account for\nthe angular dependence emerged in some analyses of the WMAP data. A g_* of\norder -0.1 is achieved when the energy of the vector is about 6-7 orders of\nmagnitude smaller than that of the scalar during inflation. For such values of\nthe parameters, the scalar-tensor correlation (which is in principle a\ndistinctive signature of anisotropic spaces) is smaller than the tensor-tensor\ncorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 20:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-08"}

The fluid having the temperature slightly above the\ncritical one is one-component. The hydrodynamic model describing a high\ncompressible fluid phase at variable physical properties inside a solid matrix\nat a uniform porosity is analyzed. A near-critical fluid is assumed to be the\nvan der Waals gas. In the limit of small variations in the density and\nthermodynamic coefficients where the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation is\napplicable, the correlation relations for the key criteria of similarity under\nthe stratification effect are obtained. These relations connect the model\nparameters (the Rayleigh-Darcy and Prandtl numbers appearing in the\ndimensionless governing equations) with the criteria of similarity (the real\nRayleigh-Darcy and Prandtl numbers characterizing convection actually).\nSteady-state Rayleigh-Darcy convection near the stability threshold in\nconditions of the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation to be valid is simulated\nnumerically. A set of solutions is analyzed with the use of the correlation\nrelations resulting in a universal dependency of the corrected Nusselt number\non the real Rayleigh-Darcy number described by a single curve. Convection of\nnear-critical fluid is compared with that of normal fluid. The temperature\ndifference at boundaries corresponding to the convection onset and depending on\nthe Schwarzschild and Rayleigh criteria is analyzed analytically. As obtained,\nnear the critical point, the threshold temperature difference at boundaries\nbecomes independent of solid matrix and is determined solely by the critical\nadiabatic temperature gradient of fluid phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 20:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-26"}

Overall, the\noxygen lines and dust continuum are weaker in star-forming objects in the SMC\nthan in the LMC. We attribute this to the lower metallicity of the SMC compared\nto that of the LMC. Whilst the dust mass differs in proportion to metallicity,\nthe oxygen mass differs less; both observations can be reconciled with higher\ndensities inside star-forming cloud cores in the SMC than in the LMC. The dust\nin the YSOs in the SMC is warmer (37-51 K) than in comparable objects in the\nLMC (32-44 K).

The current consensus is that these winds may be clumped which implies\nthat all previously derived mass loss rates using density-squared diagnostics\nare overestimated by a factor of ~ 2. However, arguments based on FUSE\nobservations of the P V resonance line doublet suggest that these rates should\nbe smaller by another order of magnitude, provided that P V is the dominant\nphosphorous ion among these stars. Although a large mass loss rate reduction\nwould have a range of undesirable consequences, it does provide a\nstraightforward explanation of the unexpected symmetric and un-shifted X-ray\nemission line profiles observed in high energy resolution spectra. But\nacceptance of such a large reduction then leads to a contradiction with an\nimportant observed X-ray property: the correlation between He-like ion source\nradii and their equivalent X-ray continuum optical depth unity radii. Here we\nexamine the phosphorous ionization balance since the P V fractional abundance,\nq(P V), is fundamental to understanding the magnitude of this mass loss\nreduction. We find that strong \"XUV\" emission lines in the He II Lyman\ncontinuum can significantly reduce q(P V). Furthermore, owing to the unique\nenergy distribution of these XUV lines, there is a negligible impact on the S V\nfractional abundance (a key component in the FUSE mass loss argument).

We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars.

However, similar\narguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.\nIn this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one\nten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris\ndisks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may\ncontribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so\nlong as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 19:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For\n8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and for 0.75 bit/symbol, the folded\nbinary code results in a higher capacity than the binary reflected gray code\n(BRGC) and the natural binary code (NBC). The 1 dB gap between the additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) capacity and the BICM capacity with the BRGC can be\nalmost completely removed if the input symbol distribution is properly\nselected. First-order asymptotics of the BICM capacity for arbitrary input\nalphabets and distributions, dimensions, mean, variance, and binary labeling\nare developed.

The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle\ndark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair\nannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold\ndark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for\ndark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter\ndominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above\n100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies. We determine upper limits to the\ngamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra from\nWIMP annihilation. The resulting integral flux above 100 MeV is constrained to\nbe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. Using recent stellar\nkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improved\ndeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidate\ndwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of WIMPs in\nseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. With the present data,\nwe are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermal\nrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and WIMPs\n(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models where\nsupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. The gamma-ray limits\npresented here also constrain some WIMP models proposed to explain the Fermi\nand PAMELA e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and models\nwith TeV masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that\n$f_{\\rm BNC}$ increases from $\\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}\n{\\rm M_{\\odot}} \\leq M \\lsim 2 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) to $\\sim\n0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \\gsim 5 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$). We\nshow that these values of $f_{\\rm BNC}$ are uncomfortably high compared to\npredictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of\ngalaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero\n$f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite\nkinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 21:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 18:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2010 23:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2011 09:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

For\n8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and for 0.75 bit/symbol, the folded\nbinary code results in a higher capacity than the binary reflected gray code\n(BRGC) and the natural binary code (NBC). The 1 dB gap between the additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) capacity and the BICM capacity with the BRGC can be\nalmost completely removed if the input symbol distribution is properly\nselected. First-order asymptotics of the BICM capacity for arbitrary input\nalphabets and distributions, dimensions, mean, variance, and binary labeling\nare developed. These asymptotics are used to define first-order optimal (FOO)\nconstellations for BICM, i.e. constellations that make BICM achieve the Shannon\nlimit $-1.59 \\tr{dB}$. It is shown that the $\\Eb/N_0$ required for reliable\ntransmission at asymptotically low rates in BICM can be as high as infinity,\nthat for uniform input distributions and 8-PAM there are only 72 classes of\nbinary labelings with a different first-order asymptotic behavior, and that\nthis number is reduced to only 26 for 8-ary phase shift keying (PSK).

While the galaxy\ncompanion rate (Nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using N-body\nsimulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually merge\ndecreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are more\ncommon in dense environments. After taking into account the merger probability\nof pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environment\ndependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshift\nrange we have probed. On the other hand, the fractional dry merger rate\nincreases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of red\ngalaxies in dense environments. We also find that the environment distribution\nof K+A galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixed\nmergers, suggesting a possible connection between K+A galaxies and wet and/or\nwet+mixed mergers. We conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regions\nare the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-day\nred-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone\n1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their mass\naccretion in the last 8 billion years.

A tight scaling between\nrichness and mass is found, with an intrinsic scatter of only 0.19 dex in mass\nand with a slope one, i.e. clusters which have twice as many galaxies are twice\nas massive. When richness is measured without any knowledge of the cluster mass\nor linked parameters (such as r200), it can predict mass with an uncertainty of\n0.29+/-0.01 dex. As a mass proxy, richness competes favourably with both direct\nmeasurements of mass given by the caustic method, which has typically 0.14 dex\nerrors (vs 0.29) and X-ray luminosity, which offers a similar 0.30 dex\nuncertainty. The similar performances of X-ray luminosity and richness in\npredicting cluster masses has been confirmed using cluster masses derived from\nvelocity dispersion fixed by numerical simulations. These results suggest that\ncluster masses can be reliably estimated from simple galaxy counts, at least at\nthe redshift and masses explored in this work. This has important applications\nin the estimation of cosmological parameters from optical cluster surveys,\nbecause in current surveys clusters detected in the optical range outnumber, by\nat least one order of magnitude, those detected in X-ray.

In random lasers, which do not have mirrors or a\nwell-defined cavity, light is confined within the gain medium by means of\nmultiple scattering. The sharp peaks in the emission spectra of semiconductor\npowders, first observed in 1999, has therefore lead to an intense debate about\nthe nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant\nfeedback. In this paper, we review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at\nclarifying the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with\ngain. We will discuss in particular the link between random laser modes near\nthreshold (TLM) and the resonances or quasi-bound (QB) states of the passive\nsystem without gain. For random lasers in the localized regime, QB states and\nthreshold lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering\nmedium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy systems\nsuch as random systems in the diffusive regime where differences between\nquasi-bound states and lasing modes were measured. Very recently, a theory able\nto treat lasers with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random\nlasers established that the TLM are better described in terms of the so-called\nconstant-flux states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 12:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

We observe\nthat the exploration of the low energy states as a function of aging time is\nonly kinetically affected by the presence of salt. We estimate that the energy\nbarrier to attain the low energy states decreases linearly with increase in the\nconcentration of salt. The observed superposition of all the elapsed time and\nthe salt concentration dependent data suggests that the aging that occurs in\nlow salt concentration systems over a very long period is qualitatively similar\nto the aging behavior observed in systems with high salt concentration over a\nshorter period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 13:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-27"}

In our model, each sensor compresses its observation sequence using a\nlinear precoder. The final decision is taken by a fusion center (FC) based on\nthe compressed information. Two families of precoders are studied: random iid\nprecoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance in the regime\nwhere both the number of sensors k and the number of samples n per sensor tend\nto infinity at the same rate, that is, k/n tends to c in (0, 1). Contributions\nare as follows. 1) Using results of random matrix theory and on large Toeplitz\nmatrices, it is proved that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector\nconverges exponentially to zero, when the above families of precoders are used.\nClosed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are provided. 2)\nIn particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the\nPrincipal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent\namong all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very few signaling overhead\nbetween the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) Moreover, when\nthe PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be\nimplemented at the FC. We show that the proposed suboptimal test enjoys the\nsame error exponent as the Neyman-Pearson test, which indicates a similar\nasymptotic behaviour of the performance.

Considerations of different\nnature (thermal, electromagnetic and mechanical), imposed stringent\nrequirements on the WGs characteristics and drove their design.

The remaining large volumes are virtually\ndevoid of luminous galaxies. This is in concordance with the formation of the\nlarge-scale structure in Universe as derived from cosmological simulations.\nHowever, the numerical results indicate that cosmological voids are abundantly\npopulated with dark matter haloes which may in principle host dwarf galaxies.\nObservational efforts have in contrast revealed, that voids are apparently\ndevoid of dwarf galaxies. We investigate the formation of dwarf galaxies in\nvoids by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Due to the cosmic\nultra-violet background radiation low-mass haloes show generally are reduced\nbaryon fraction. We determine the characteristic mass below which dwarf\ngalaxies are baryon deficient. We show that the circular velocity below which\nthe accretion of baryons is suppressed is approximately 40 km/s. The suppressed\nbaryon accretion is caused by the photo-heating due to the UV-background. We\nset up a spherical halo model and show that the effective equation of state of\nthe gas in the periphery of dwarf galaxies determines the characteristic mass.\nThis implies that any process which heats the gas around dwarf galaxies\nincreases the characteristic mass and thus reduces the number of observable\ndwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 15:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We suggest a new geometric\ninterpretation of the stationary Weyl equation, one which does not require the\nuse of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. We think of our\n3-dimensional space as an elastic continuum and assume that material points of\nthis continuum can experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework\nis a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material\npoints of the space continuum are described mathematically by attaching to each\ngeometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases\ncalled the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we\nchoose the coframe and a density. We choose a particular potential energy which\nis conformally invariant and then incorporate time into our action in the\nstandard Newtonian way, by subtracting kinetic energy. The main result of our\npaper is the theorem stating that in the stationary setting our model is\nequivalent to a pair of Weyl equations. The crucial element of the proof is the\nobservation that our Lagrangian admits a factorization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2010 15:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}
