We take our investigation to the simple $d$-dimensional\nlattices for $d=1,2,3,4,5$ and fit $p,q$-binomial distributions to our data,\nsome of which are exact but most are sampled. For $d=1$ and $d=5$ the\nmagnetisation distributions are remarkably well-fitted by $p,q$-binomial\ndistributions.

We begin the paper by giving results on the\nbehaviour of the $p,q$-distribution and its moment growth exponents given a\ncertain parameterization of $p,q$. Since the moment exponents are known for the\nIsing model (or at least approximately for $d=3$) we can predict how $p,q$\nshould behave and compare this to our measured $p,q$.

The transport theoretical\ndescription of quarks and gluons is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model\nfor partons matched to reproduce recent lattice QCD results in thermodynamic\nequilibrium. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is\ndescribed by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs\nor three quarks (antiquarks). Studying Pb+Pb reactions from 40 to 158 A GeV, we\nfind that at most 40% of the collision energy is stored in the dynamics of the\npartons. This implies that a large fraction of non-partonic, i.e. hadronic or\nstring-like matter, which can be viewed as a hadronic corona, is present in\nthese reactions, thus neither hadronic nor purely partonic models can be\nemployed to extract physical conclusions in comparing model results with data.\nOn the other hand, comparing the PHSD results to those of the Hadron-String\nDynamics (HSD) approach without the phase transition to QGP, we observe that\nthe existence of the partonic phase has a sizeable influence on the transverse\nmass distribution of final kaons due to the repulsive partonic mean fields and\ninitial partonic scattering. Furthermore, we find a significant effect of the\nQGP on the production of multi-strange antibaryons due to a slightly enhanced\ns+sbar pair production in the partonic phase from massive time-like gluon decay\nand to a more abundant formation of strange antibaryons in the hadronization\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2010 18:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The measurement uses\nmaps with 1.4' angular resolution made with data from the Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope (ACT). The observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,\nin a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees South. The CMB at\narcminute angular scales is particularly sensitive to the Silk damping scale,\nto the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect from galaxy clusters, and to emission by\nradio sources and dusty galaxies. After masking the 108 brightest point sources\nin our maps, we estimate the power spectrum between 600 < \\ell < 8000 using the\nadaptive multi-taper method to minimize spectral leakage and maximize use of\nthe full data set. Our absolute calibration is based on observations of Uranus.\nTo verify the calibration and test the fidelity of our map at large angular\nscales, we cross-correlate the ACT map to the WMAP map and recover the WMAP\npower spectrum from 250 < ell < 1150. The power beyond the Silk damping tail of\nthe CMB is consistent with models of the emission from point sources. We\nquantify the contribution of SZ clusters to the power spectrum by fitting to a\nmodel normalized at sigma8 = 0.8. We constrain the model's amplitude ASZ < 1.63\n(95% CL). If interpreted as a measurement of sigma8, this implies sigma8^SZ <\n0.86 (95% CL) given our SZ model. A fit of ACT and WMAP five-year data jointly\nto a 6-parameter LCDM model plus terms for point sources and the SZ effect is\nconsistent with these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 04:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2010 05:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-30"}

In this\npaper we review our recent efforts on the solution space fine structures of the\nrandom K-SAT problem. A heterogeneity transition is predicted to occur in the\nsolution space as the constraint density alpha reaches a critical value\nalpha_cm. This transition marks the emergency of exponentially many solution\ncommunities in the solution space. After the heterogeneity transition the\nsolution space is still ergodic until alpha reaches a larger threshold value\nalpha_d, at which the solution communities disconnect from each other to become\ndifferent solution clusters (ergodicity-breaking). The existence of solution\ncommunities in the solution space is confirmed by numerical simulations of\nsolution space random walking, and the effect of solution space heterogeneity\non a stochastic local search algorithm SEQSAT, which performs a random walk of\nsingle-spin flips, is investigated. The relevance of this work to glassy\ndynamics studies is briefly mentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 03:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 03:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The distinction is of critical\nimportance: the IMF influences most of the observable properties of stellar\npopulations and galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide\ndeep insights into the process by which stars form. In this review, we take a\ncritical look at the case for IMF variations, with a view towards whether other\nexplanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, local\nyoung clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the\nvast majority were drawn from a \"universal\" IMF: a power-law of Salpeter index\n($\\Gamma=1.35$) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower\npower-law ($\\Gamma \\sim 0-0.25$) between a few tenths and a few solar masses\n(ignoring the effects of unresolved binaries). The shape and universality of\nthe IMF at the stellar-substellar boundary is still under investigation and\nuncertainties remain large, but most observations are consistent with a IMF\nthat declines ($\\Gamma < -0.5$) well below the hydrogen burning limit.\nObservations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of\nmost galaxies are also consistent with a \"universal IMF\", suggesting no gross\nvariations in the IMF over much of cosmic time. There are indications of\n\"non-standard\" IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments, which\nclearly warrant further study. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence that the\nIMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions\nafter the first few generations of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 07:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2010 15:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures. In other words, to recover a factorization\nformula, it has become common to assume that it is sufficient to simply modify\nthe Wilson lines in the parton correlation functions for each separate hadron.\nIn this paper, we will illustrate by direct counter-example that this is not\npossible in a non-Abelian gauge theory. Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and\nexplicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry\nin a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field. The observed breakdown of\ngeneralized transverse momentum dependent factorization challenges the notion\nthat the role of parton transverse momentum in such processes can be described\nusing separate correlation functions for each external hadron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 09:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 08:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-19"}

To characterize a possible many-body localization transition as a\nfunction of the disorder strength $W$, we use an exact renormalization\nprocedure in configuration space that generalizes the Aoki real-space RG\nprocedure for Anderson localization one-particle models [H.

We focus on the statistical properties of the renormalized\nhopping $V_L$ between two configurations separated by a distance $L$ in\nconfiguration space (distance being defined as the minimal number of elementary\nmoves to go from one configuration to the other). Our numerical results point\ntowards the existence of a many-body localization transition at a finite\ndisorder strength $W_c$.

We\nstudy the model in its annealed random graph version, on a fixed network, and\non a network evolving through the actions. The sizes of actions are distributed\nwith a power-law tail, however, the exponent is non-universal and depends on\nthe frequency of actions and sparseness of the available connections between\nunits. Allowing the network reconstruction over time in a self-organized\nmanner, e.g., by adding the links based on previous liaisons between units, we\nfind that the power-law exponent depends on the evolution time of the network.\nIts lower limit is given by the universal value 5/2, derived analytically for\nthe case of random fragmentation processes. In the temporal patterns behind the\nsize of actions we find long-range correlations in the time series of number of\nclusters and non-trivial distribution of time that a unit waits between two\nactions. In the case of an evolving network the distribution develops a\npower-law tail, indicating that through the repeated actions, the system\ndevelops internal structure which is not just more effective in terms of the\nsize of events, but also has a full hierarchy of units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 10:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-19"}

Our sample of\ngroups and clusters includes AGN feedback and is of high enough resolution to\naccurately resolve galaxy populations down to the smallest galaxies that are\nexpected to significantly contribute to the stellar mass budget. We describe\nand test four different methods to identify the ICL in simulations, thereby\nallowing us to assess the reliability of the measurements. For all of the\nmethods, we consistently find a very significant ICL stellar fraction (~45%)\nwhich exceeds the values typically inferred from observations. However, we show\nthat this result is robust with respect to numerical resolution and integration\naccuracy, remarkably insensitive to changes in the star formation model, and\nalmost independent of halo mass. It is also almost invariant when black hole\ngrowth is included, even though AGN feedback successfully prevents excessive\novercooling in clusters and leads to a drastically improved agreement of the\nsimulated cluster galaxy population with observations. In particular, the\nluminosities of central galaxies and the ages of their stellar populations are\nmuch more realistic when including AGN. In the light of these findings, it\nappears challenging to construct a simulation model that simultaneously matches\nthe cluster galaxy population and at the same time produces a low ICL\ncomponent. We find that intracluster stars are preferentially stripped in a\ncluster's densest region from massive galaxies that fall into the cluster at\nz>1.

Recently, doubts have been raised about visible\nStokes profiles to provide a clear distinction between weak fields and strong\nones filling a small fraction of the observed area. The goal of this paper is\nto give qualitative and quantitative arguments that help in settling the debate\nsince several instruments that employ visible lines are either operating or\nplanned for the near future. The sensitivity of the Stokes profiles is\ncalculated through the response functions (e.g. Ruiz Cobo & Del Toro Iniesta,\n1994). Both theoretical and empirical evidences are gathered in favor of the\nreliability of visible Stokes profiles. The response functions are used as well\nfor estimating the uncertainties in the physical quantities due to noise in the\nobservations. A useful formula has been derived that takes into account the\nmeasurement technique (number of polarization measurements, polarimetric\nefficiencies, number of wavelength samples), the model assumptions (number of\nfree parameters, the filling factor), and the radiative transfer (response\nfunctions). We conclude that a scenario with a weak magnetic field can\nreasonably be distinguished with visible lines from another with a strong field\nbut a similar Stokes $V$ amplitude, provided that the Milne-Eddington\napproximation is good enough to describe the solar atmosphere and that the\npolarization signal is at least three or four times larger than the typical rms\nnoise of $ 10^{-3} I_{\\rm c}$ reached in the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 11:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

The\nrelation between the main features of the distribution of the delay times (DTD)\nand the masses of the progenitors is illustrated for the single (SD) and double\ndegenerate (DD) models. Mixed models, which assume contributions from both the\nSD and DD channels, are also presented and tested versus the observed\ncorrelations between the SN Ia rates and the parent galaxy properties. It is\nshown that these correlations can be accounted for with both single channel and\nmixed models, and that the rate in S0 and E galaxies may effectively provide\nclues on the contribution of SD progenitors to late epoch explosions. A wide\nrange of masses for the CO WD at the start of accretion is expected in almost\nall galaxy types; only in galaxies of the earliest types the properties of the\nprogenitors are expected to be more uniform. For mixed models, late type\ngalaxies should host SD and DD explosions in comparable fractions, while in\nearly type galaxies DD explosions should largely prevail. Events hosted by star\nforming galaxies span a wide range of delay times; \\textit{prompt} events could\ndominate only in the presence of a strong star-burst. It is concluded that\nnearby SN Ia samples should well include the young, massive and hot progenitors\nthat necessarily dominate at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 12:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

So, any temporal inference relies in first instance\non the observer own time. The question is thus: what fixes the observer proper\ntime? This will be the crucial point debated here. This implies analyzing at\nthe very first why the observer can be taken as a motionless reference in spite\nof being himself inertial. Is this just an approximation, and if so, up to what\nextent can it be applied? The framework of special relativity is compared to an\namended form in which the fact of taking himself as a reference does not allow\nthe observer to overlook its own kinetics. So, the issue stands on which of two\nformulations of the Lorentz gamma factor is the most accurate one: its standard\nexpression or an amended one which takes into account the fact that the\nobserver is himself inertial, while the former disregards it. When the observer\nspeed is ignored, the two formulations become identical.

The total cross\nsection, angular distributions of both omega-mesons and protons were measured\nand presented in various reference frames such as the overall CMS, helicity and\nJackson frame.
