Once a nonlinear equation is\nwritten in a bilinear form, its quasi-periodic wave solutions can be directly\nobtained by using a formula. Moreover, properties of these solutions are\ninvestigated in detail by analyzing their structures, plots and asymptotic\nbehaviors. The relations between the quasi-periodic wave solutions and soliton\nsolutions are rigorously established. It is shown that the soliton solutions\ncan be obtained only as limiting cases of the quasi-periodic wave solutions\nunder small amplitude limits in superspace $\\mathbb{R}_\\Lambda^{2,1}$. We find\nthat, in contrast to the purely bosonic case, there is an interesting\ninfluencing band occurred among the quasi-periodic waves under the presence of\nthe Grassmann variable. The quasi-periodic waves are symmetric about the band\nbut collapse along with the band. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the\nquasi-periodic waves increase as the waves move away from the band. The\nefficiency of our proposed method can be demonstrated on a class variety of\nsupersymmetric equations such as those considered in this paper,\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric KdV, Sawada-Kotera-Ramani and Ito's equations,\nas well as $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric KdV equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2010 01:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-12"}

Each pool is then tested and defective items are\nidentified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools\nrequired to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in\nnetwork tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of\ngroup testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group\ntesting problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a\ngraph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any\nset of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated\nwith a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to\nthe special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,\nnamely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is\nsubstantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing\nproblems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if\nT(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with\n$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective\nitems. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as\nexpander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\\log^3n)$\nnon-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items. Next, a\nspecific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it\nis shown that $m=O(d^3\\log^3n)$ non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify\n$d$ defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing\nproblem are considered, for which parallel results are developed.

We first study the ergodic sum-rate of the 1-bit feedback scheme,\nand consider the impact of feedback delay on the system. A closed-form\nexpression for the achievable ergodic sum-rate is presented as a function of\nthe fading temporal correlation coefficient. It is proved that the sum-rate\nscales as loglogK, which is the same scaling law achieved by the optimal\nnon-delayed full CSI feedback scheme. The sum-rate degradation due to outdated\nCSI is also evaluated in the asymptotic regimes of either large K or low SNR.\nThe outage performance of the 1-bit feedback scheme for both instantaneous and\noutdated feedback is then investigated. Expressions for the outage\nprobabilities are derived, along with the corresponding diversity-multiplexing\ntradeoffs (DMT). It is shown that with instantaneous feedback, a power\nallocation based on the feedback bits enables to double the DMT compared to the\ncase with short-term power constraint in which a dynamic power allocation is\nnot allowed. But, with outdated feedback, the advantage of power allocation is\nlost, and the DMT reverts to that achievable with no CSI feedback.\nNevertheless, for finite SNR, improvement in terms of outage probability can\nstill be obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2010 05:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-12"}

We interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precession\nof the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.\nOver the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more than\na factor of three. Large variations have also been observed in the 1400-MHz\nmean flux density. The pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 April\nusing digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variations\nin both linear and circular polarization. Position angle variations, both\nacross the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with major\ndifferences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. Modelling\nof the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of the\npulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 deg\nand that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course of\nour observations. At the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impact\nparameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0\ndeg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. We\nhave therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing that\nit is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. The derived\nprecessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2\nMsun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small.
