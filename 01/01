That is, for each\nsmooth function $f:{\\mathbb R}^n\\to\\mathbb R$ there is an $n$-fold operation\n$\\Phi_f:C^\\infty(X)^n\\to C^\\infty(X)$ acting by $\\Phi_f:(c_1,\\ldots,c_n)\\mapsto\nf(c_1,...,c_n)$, and these operations $\\Phi_f$ satisfy many natural identities.\nThus, $C^\\infty(X)$ actually has a far richer structure than the obvious\n$\\mathbb R$-algebra structure.\n  We develop a version of algebraic geometry in which rings or algebras are\nreplaced by $C^\\infty$-rings. As schemes are the basic objects in algebraic\ngeometry, the new basic objects are $C^\\infty$-$schemes$, a category of\ngeometric objects which generalize smooth manifolds, and whose morphisms\ngeneralize smooth maps. We also study quasicoherent and coherent sheaves on\n$C^\\infty$-schemes, and $C^\\infty$-$stacks$, in particular Deligne-Mumford\n$C^\\infty$-stacks, a 2-category of geometric objects generalizing orbifolds.\n  This enables us to use the tools of algebraic geometry in differential\ngeometry, and to describe singular spaces such as moduli spaces occurring in\ndifferential geometric problems. This paper forms the foundations of the\nauthor's new theory of \"derived differential geometry\", surveyed in\narXiv:1206.4207 and in more detail in arXiv:1208.4948, which studies\nd-manifolds and d-orbifolds, \"derived\" versions of smooth manifolds and smooth\norbifolds. Derived differential geometry has applications to areas of\nsymplectic geometry involving moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves.\n  Many of these ideas are not new: $C^\\infty$-rings and $C^\\infty$-schemes have\nlong been part of synthetic differential geometry. But we develop them in new\ndirections.

The nominal precision\nof the new Doppler measurements is about 150 s$^{-1}$ while their standard\ndeviation is 250 ms$^{-1}$.

By application of a general result, corresponding\nfamilies of exact solutions are obtained that in particular comprise the matrix\nsoliton solutions in the focusing NLS case.

When the deflagration\nwave passes through the outer layer of the CO WD, p-nuclei are produced by\nphotodisintegration reactions on s-nuclei in a region with the peak temperature\nranging from 1.9 to 3.6 x10^9 K.

We find that about 50% of p-nuclides are co-produced\nwhen normalized to their solar abundances in all adopted cases of seed\ndistribution. Mo and Ru, which are largely underproduced in Type II supernovae\n(SNe II), are produced more than in SNe II although they are underproduced with\nrespect to the yield levels of other p-nuclides. The ratios between p-nuclei\nand iron in the ejecta are larger than the solar ratios by a factor of 1.2.

The high resolution of the\nobservations reveals that G54.1+0.3 has a complex radio structure which\nincludes filamentary and loop-like structures that are magnetized, a diffuse\nextent similar to the associated diffuse X-ray emission. But the radio and\nX-ray structures in the central region differ strikingly, indicating that they\ntrace very different forms of particle injection from the pulsar and/or\nparticle acceleration in the nebula. No spectral index gradient is detected in\nthe radio emission across the PWN, whereas the X-ray emission softens outward\nin the nebula. The extensive radio polarization allows us to image in detail\nthe intrinsic magnetic field, which is well-ordered and reveals that a number\nof loop-like filaments are strongly magnetized. In addition, we determine that\nthere are both radial and toroidal components to the magnetic field structure\nof the pulsar wind nebula. Strong mid-IR emission detected in Spitzer Space\nTelescope data is closely correlated with the radio emission arising from the\nsouthern edge of G54.1+0.3. In particular, the distributions of radio and X-ray\nemission compared with the mid-IR emission suggest that the PWN may be\ninteracting with this interstellar cloud.

First, the Fourier transform is a single-step\noperation in a continuous-variable (CV) setting. Additionally, any\nimplementation of the oracle is nontrivial in both schemes. The steps of the\ncomputation are very similar to those in the CV algorithm, with the main\ndifference being the way in which the qunats, or quantum units of analogic\ninformation, and the qubits interact in the oracle. Using both discrete and\ncontinuous states of light, linear devices, and photo-detection, an optical\nimplementation of the oracle is proposed. For simplicity, infinitely squeezed\nstates are used in the continuous register, whereas the optical qubit is\nencoded in the dual-rail logic of the KLM protocol. The initial assumption of\nideal states as qunats will be dropped to study the effects of finite squeezing\nin the quality of the computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2009 22:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

It is well known that Lasso can estimate the nonparametric\nregression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve\nupon. We show that the OLS post-Lasso estimator performs at least as well as\nLasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller\nbias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the Lasso-based model\nselection \"fails\" in the sense of missing some components of the \"true\"\nregression model. By the \"true\" model, we mean the best s-dimensional\napproximation to the nonparametric regression function chosen by the oracle.\nFurthermore, OLS post-Lasso estimator can perform strictly better than Lasso,\nin the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the Lasso-based model\nselection correctly includes all components of the \"true\" model as a subset and\nalso achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly\nselects the \"true\" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle\nestimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on\nthe dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this\ndimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the \"true\" model.\nOur rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and\nnonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso\nestimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other\nestimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and\ngood sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and\na new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional\nsparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit.

The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for\nAlice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in\nterms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security\nis measured in terms of Eve's equivocation ratio. Wyner showed that the\nsituation is characterized by a single constant C_s, called the secrecy\ncapacity, which has the following meaning: for all $\\epsilon > 0$, there exist\ncoding schemes of rate $R \\ge C_s - \\epsilon$ that asymptotically achieve both\nthe reliability and the security objectives. However, his proof of this result\nis based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument. To date, despite a\nconsiderable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct\ncoding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel C_2 is an\nerasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.\n  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of\nsymmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and\ndecoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme\nthat achieves the secrecy capacity for a wide range of wiretap channels. Our\nconstruction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as long\nas both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and binary-input, and C_2 is degraded with\nrespect to C_1. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to\nprovide strong security, in the sense defined by Maurer, while still operating\nat a rate that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot\nguarantee that the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main\nchannel C_1 is noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2010 05:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2011 00:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We confirm a strong correlation between\nthe large separation of the oscillations (Delta nu) and the frequency of\nmaximum power (nu_max). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max\n> 100 muHz, L <~ 30 L_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the\nunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning\nstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar\nevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. We\nuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scaling\ntheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial and\nnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degree\nl=3. Measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot the\nso-called C-D diagram of delta nu_02 versus Delta nu. The small separation\ndelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,\ncontrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge for l=1 is notably\nbroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoretical\npredictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall, the results demonstrate the\ntremendous potential of Kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2010 12:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 12:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The EDM of the Dirac tau\nneutrino is also computed from loops involving the exhange of the W, the\ncharginos, the mirror leptons and mirror sleptons.
