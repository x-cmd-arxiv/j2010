Traditionally, an event is\ndescribed as having jets which are independent objects; each jet has some\nenergy, size, and possible substructure such as subjets or heavy flavor\ncontent. This description discards information connecting the jets to each\nother, which can be used to determine if the jets came from decay of a color\nsinglet object, or if they were initiated by quarks or gluons.

By\nstudying general ultraviolet perturbations in supergravity, we systematically\nincorporate `compactification effects' sourced by supersymmetry breaking in the\ncompact space. Significant contributions to the D3-brane potential, including\nthe leading term in the infrared, arise from imaginary anti-self-dual (IASD)\nfluxes. For an arbitrary Calabi-Yau cone, we determine the most general IASD\nfluxes in terms of scalar harmonics, then compute the resulting D3-brane\npotential. Specializing to the conifold, we identify the operator dual to each\nmode of flux, and for chiral operators we confirm that the potential computed\nin the gauge theory matches the gravity result. The effects of four-dimensional\ncurvature, including the leading D3-brane mass term, arise directly from the\nten-dimensional equations of motion. Furthermore, we show that gaugino\ncondensation on D7-branes provides a local source for IASD flux. This flux\nprecisely encodes the nonperturbative contributions to the D3-brane potential,\nyielding a promising ten-dimensional representation of four-dimensional\nnonperturbative effects. Our result encompasses all significant contributions\nto the D3-brane potential discussed in the literature, and does so in the\nsingle coherent framework of ten-dimensional supergravity. Moreover, we\nidentify new terms with irrational scaling dimensions that were inaccessible in\nprior works. By decoupling gravity in a noncompact configuration, then\nsystematically reincorporating compactification effects as ultraviolet\nperturbations, we have provided an approach in which Planck-suppressed\ncontributions to the D3-brane effective action can be computed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 16:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Both these two models are motivated within the string theory\nlandscape using flux-compactification and their predictions for scalar spectral\nindex are compatible with WMAP results.

However, efforts to\ndetermine the primordial helium abundance via observations of metal poor H II\nregions have been limited by significant uncertainties. This work builds upon\nprevious work by providing an updated and extended program in evaluating these\nuncertainties. Procedural consistency is achieved by integrating the hydrogen\nbased reddening correction with the helium based abundance calculation, i.e.,\nall physical parameters are solved for simultaneously. We include new atomic\ndata for helium recombination and collisional emission based upon recent work\nby Porter et al. and wavelength dependent corrections to underlying absorption\nare investigated. The set of physical parameters has been expanded here to\ninclude the effects of neutral hydrogen collisional emission. Because of a\ndegeneracy between the solutions for density and temperature, the precision of\nthe helium abundance determinations is limited. Also, at lower temperatures (T\n\\lesssim 13,000 K) the neutral hydrogen fraction is poorly constrained\nresulting in a larger uncertainty in the helium abundances. Thus the derived\nerrors on the helium abundances for individual objects are larger than those\ntypical of previous studies. The updated emissivities and neutral hydrogen\ncorrection generally raise the abundance. From a regression to zero\nmetallicity, we find Y_p as 0.2561 \\pm 0.0108, in broad agreement with the WMAP\nresult. Tests with synthetic data show a potential for distinct improvement,\nvia removal of underlying absorption, using higher resolution spectra.

This motivates the study of cosmological inflation induced by a\nslow-rolling scalar field.

The next step consists in relating the\nperturbations generated during inflation to the perturbations of the\ncosmological fluid in the radiation dominated phase.

This review focuses\non the range of epxerimental consequences such UV-IR mixings have on the normal\nstate of the cuprates, such as the pseudogap, mid-infrared band, temperature\ndependence of the Hall number, the superfluid density, and a recent theoretical\nadvance which permits the identification of the weakly interacting degrees of\nfreedom in a doped Mott insulator. Within this theory, we show how the wide\nrange of phenomena which typify the normal state of the cuprates arises\nincluding $T-$linear resistivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 21:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2010 15:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In addition to usual 6 quantum numbers related to external symmetries\n(given by left generators), there appear additional quantum numbers related to\ninternal symmetries (given by right generators). We believe that the proposed\napproach can be useful for description of elementary spinning particles\nconsidering as orientable objects. In particular, their classification in the\nframework of the approach under consideration reproduces the usual\nclassification but is more comprehensive. This allows one to give a\ngroup-theoretical interpretation to some facts of the existing phenomenological\nclassification of known spinning particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 23:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In order to use the quantum walk to its fullest\npotential, it is important to know and optimize the properties purely due to\nquantum dynamics and in presence of noise. Various studies of its dynamics in\nthe absence and presence of noise have been reported.

To relieve the tedium of having to\nconstantly fill in such gaps \"by hand\", we make here a systematic effort to\ndetermine the complete set of estimates in the bilinear case.

To solve this task, we use the well-known\ncylindrical coordinates in Riemann and Lobachevsky spaces, naturally related\nwith Euler angle-parameters. Conclusion may be drawn: the general method of\nseparation of variables embraces the all plane wave solutions; the plane waves\nin Lobachevsky and Riemann space consist of a small part of the whole set of\nbasis wave functions of Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n  In space of constant positive curvature $S_{3}$, a complex analog of\nhorospherical coordinates of Lobachevsky space $H_{3}$ is introduced. To\nparameterize real space $S_{3}$, two complex coordinates $(r,z)$ must obey\nadditional restriction in the form of the equation $r^{2} = e^{z-z^{*}} -\ne^{2z} $. The metrical tensor of space $S_{3}$ is expressed in terms of $(r,z)$\nwith additional constraint, or through pairs of conjugate variables $(r,r^{*})$\nor $(z,z^{*})$; correspondingly exist three different representations for\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger Hamiltonian.

As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become\nsignificantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from\nthermonuclear burning. We wonder whether high energy electrons and gamma-rays,\ninjected within the binary system, can efficiently interact with this enhanced\nradiation field. To decide this, we calculate the optical depths for the\ngamma-ray photons in the radiation field of such irradiated star as a function\nof the phase of the binary system. Based on these calculations, we conclude\nthat compact low mass X-ray binary systems may also become sources of high\nenergy gamma-rays since conditions for interaction of electrons and gamma-rays\nare quite similar to these ones observed within the high mass TeV gamma-ray\nbinaries such as LS 5039 and LSI 303 +61. However, due to differences in the\nsoft radiation field, the expected gamma-ray light curves can significantly\ndiffer between low mass and high mass X-ray binaries. As an example, we apply\nsuch calculations to two well known LMXBs: Her X-1 and Sco X-1.

Even when the three elements are taken to be\nvariables in a polynomial ring in three variables over a field, this point of\nview gives a larger class of ideals than just the defining ideals of monomial\ncurves. We then characterize when the ideals in this larger class are prime, we\nshow that they are usually radical and, using the theory of multiplicities, we\ngive upper bounds on the number of their minimal prime ideals, one of these\nprimes being a uniquely determined prime ideal of definition of a monomial\ncurve. Finally, we provide examples of characteristic-dependent minimal prime\nand primary structures for these ideals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 12:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-01"}

In large spiral galaxies, the rate of transformation of H2 into\nstars (hereafter SFE) varies little. However, the SFE in distant objects (z~1)\nis much higher than in the large spiral disks that dominate the local universe.\nSome small local group galaxies share at least some of the characteristics of\nintermediate-redshift objects, such as size or color. Recent work has suggested\nthat the Star Formation Efficiency (SFE, defined as the SFRate per unit H2) in\nlocal Dwarf galaxies may be as high as in the distant objects. A fundamental\ndifficulty in these studies is the independent measure of the H2 mass in\nmetal-deficient environments. At 490 kpc, NGC6822 is an excellent choice for\nthis study; it has been mapped in the CO(2-1) line using the multibeam receiver\nHERA on the 30 meter IRAM telescope, yielding the largest sample of giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) in this galaxy. Despite the much lower metallicity, we\nfind no clear difference in the properties of the GMCs in NGC 6822 and those in\nthe Milky Way except lower CO luminosities for a given mass. Several\nindependent methods indicate that the total H2 mass in NGC 6822 is about 5 x\n10^6 Msun in the area we mapped and less than 10^7 Msun in the whole galaxy.\nThis corresponds to a NH2/ICO ~ 4 x 10^{21} cm^-2 /(Kkm/s) over large scales,\nsuch as would be observed in distant objects, and half that in individual GMCs.\nNo evidence was found for H2 without CO emission. Our simulations of the\nradiative transfer in clouds are entirely compatible with these NH2/ICO values.\nThe SFE implied is a factor 5 - 10 higher than what is observed in large local\nuniverse spirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 13:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

While the average value and the spread of Gamma(z)\nincrease with z, such an effect is larger for massive BHs, reaching values\nGamma=5 for massive Black Holes (M>10^9 M_{\\odot}) at z>4, in agreement with\nrecent observations of high-redshift QSOs; this is due to the effectiveness of\ninteractions in triggering BH accretion in high-density environments at high\nredshifts.

The sample contains type-1 and type-2 AGN in the\nform of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical and\nradio luminosity. We find, on average, that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containing\na substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of the\nAGN, constituting a >8-sigma excess relative to the field. Secondly, we find\nevidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radio\nluminosity of AGN, but not with black-hole mass. This is shown first by\ndividing the AGN into their classical AGN types, where we see more significant\nover-densities in the fields of the radio-loud AGN. If instead we dispense with\nthe classical AGN definitions, we find that the source over-density as a\nfunction of radio luminosity for all our AGN exhibits a positive correlation.\nOne interpretation of this result is that the Mpc-scale environment is in some\nway influencing the radio emission that we observe from AGN. This could be\nexplained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading to\nenhanced radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapid\nblack-hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 15:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The famous Hodgkin-Huxley model, which describes how action potentials\nof a neuron are initiated and propagated, consists of four coupled nonlinear\ndifferential equations. Because these equations are difficult to deal with,\nthere also exist several simplified models, of which many exhibit\npolynomial-like non-linearity. Examples of such models are the Fitzhugh-Nagumo\n(FHN) model, the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) model, the Morris-Lecar (ML) model and the\nIzhikevich model. In this work, we first prescribe the biologically relevant\nparameter ranges for the FHN model and subsequently study the dynamical\nbehaviour of coupled neurons on small networks of two or three nodes. To do\nthis, we use a computational real algebraic geometry method called the\nDiscriminant Variety (DV) method to perform the stability and bifurcation\nanalysis of these small networks. A time series analysis of the FHN model can\nbe found elsewhere in related work[15].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 15:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-01"}
