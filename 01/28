The code is a combination of the CoCoNuT hydro module, which is a\nRiemann-solver based, high-resolution shock-capturing method, and the\nthree-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport scheme VERTEX. VERTEX\nintegrates the neutrino moment equations with a variable Eddington factor\nclosure computed from a model Boltzmann equation and uses the ray-by-ray plus\napproximation in 2D, assuming the neutrino distribution to be axially symmetric\naround the radial direction, and thus the neutrino flux to be radial. Our\nspacetime treatment employs the ADM 3+1 formalism with the conformal flatness\ncondition for the spatial three-metric. This approach is exact in 1D and has\nbeen shown to yield very accurate results also for rotational stellar collapse.\nWe introduce new formulations of the energy equation to improve total energy\nconservation in relativistic and Newtonian hydro simulations with Eulerian\nfinite-volume codes. Moreover, a modified version of the VERTEX scheme is\ndeveloped that simultaneously conserves energy and lepton number with better\naccuracy and higher numerical stability. To verify our code, we conduct a\nseries of tests, including a detailed comparison with published 1D results for\nstellar core collapse. Long-time simulations of proto-neutron star cooling over\nseveral seconds both demonstrate the robustness of the new CoCoNuT-VERTEX code\nand show the approximate treatment of GR effects by means of an effective\ngravitational potential as in PROMETHEUS-VERTEX to be remarkably accurate in\n1D.

A new\nmethod called \"phase closure nulling\" has been proposed for the detection of\nsuch faint and close companions based on interferometric observations when the\nsystem visibility amplitude is close to zero due to the large diameter of the\nprimary star. We aim at demonstrating this method by analyzing observations\nobtained on the spectroscopic binary HD 59717. Methods: Using the AMBER/VLTI\ninstrument in the K-band with ~1500 spectral resolution, we record the\nspectrally dispersed closures phases of the SB1 binary HD 59717 with a\nthree-baseline combination adequate for applying phase closure methods. After a\ncareful data reduction, we fit the primary diameter, the binary flux ratio, and\nthe separation using the phase closure data.

To what extent do optical surveys allow us to\ninclude extreme, dusty, morphologically disturbed galaxies in our \"complete\"\ncensus of black hole-galaxy co-evolution?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 21:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The valley degeneracy\nmay be lifted by the interface potential, which gives rise to a valley-orbit\ncoupling, but the latter depends on the detailed structure of the interface and\nis generally unknown a priori. These facts motivate us to provide an extensive\nstudy of spin qubits in Si double quantum dots, accounting fully for the valley\ndegree of freedom and assuming no prior knowledge of the valley-orbit coupling.\nFor single-spin qubits we analyze the spectrum of a multivalley double quantum\ndot, discuss the initialization of one qubit, identify the conditions for the\nlowest energy two-electron states to be a singlet and a triplet well separated\nfrom other states, and determine analytical expressions for the exchange\nsplitting. For singlet-triplet qubits we analyze the single-dot spectrum and\ninitialization process, the double-dot spectrum, singlet-triplet mixing in an\ninhomogeneous magnetic field and the peculiarities of spin blockade in\nmultivalley qubits. We review briefly the hyperfine interaction in Si and\ndiscuss its role in spin blockade in natural Si, including intravalley and\nintervalley effects. We study the evolution of the double-dot spectrum as a\nfunction of magnetic field. We address briefly the situation in which the\nvalley-orbit coupling is different in each dot due to interface roughness. We\npropose a new experiment for measuring the valley splitting in a single quantum\ndot. We discuss the possibility of devising other types of qubits in Si QDs,\nand the size of the intervaley coupling due to the Coulomb interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 21:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 07:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this review, I focus on the possible\ncentral engines of long-duration GRBs, and the constraints that present\nobservations place on these models. Long GRBs are definitively associated with\nthe deaths of massive stars, but whether the central engine is an accreting\nblack hole or a rapidly-spinning, highly-magnetized neutron star (a\n\"proto-magnetar\") remains unsettled. This distinction has been brought into\nparticular focus by recent MHD simulations of the core-collapse of massive,\nrotating \"collapsar progenitors,\" which suggest that powerful\nmagneto-centrifugal outflows from the proto-neutron star may stave off black\nhole formation entirely. Although both black hole and magnetar GRB models\nremain viable, I argue that the magnetar model is more mature in the sense that\nit provides quantitative explanations for the durations, energies, Lorentz\nfactors, and collimation of long GRB outflows. Given these virtues, one\npromising strategy to break the present stalemate is to further develop the\nmagnetar model until inescapable (and falsifiable) predictions emerge. This\ncourse of action signals a renewed challenge to translate time-dependent jet\nproperties (power, magnetization, and Lorentz factor) into observables\n(gamma-ray light curves and spectra).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 21:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-29"}

Significant reduction in\nsystematic uncertainty of the measurement due to non-flow effects has been\nachieved by correlating particles at midrapidity, $|\\eta|<1.0$, with those at\nforward rapidity, $2.5<|\\eta|<4.0$. We also present azimuthal correlations in\np+p collisions at 200 GeV to help estimating non-flow effects.

We have found that ideal hydrodynamic calculations\nfail to reproduce the centrality dependence of $v_{2}$($p_{T}$) for $K_{S}^{0}$\nand $\\Lambda$. Eccentricity scaled $v_2$ values, $v_{2}/\\epsilon$, are larger\nin more central collisions, suggesting stronger collective flow develops in\nmore central collisions.

The low-velocity system required also two absorbing components, one\nwith temperature of 5.8X10^5K; the other with lower temperature (3.5X10^4K).\nOnce these components are considered, the data do not require any further\nabsorbers. In particular, a model consisting of a continuous radial range of\nionization structures is not required.

The standard mathematical model for the error analysis of the\nmethod measures the performance of a given scheme by the rate at which the\nassociated reconstruction error decays as a function of the oversampling ratio\n$\\lambda$. It was recently shown that exponential accuracy of the form\n$O(2^{-r\\lambda})$ can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma-Delta\nmodulation schemes. By general information-entropy arguments $r$ must be less\nthan 1. The current best known value for $r$ is approximately 0.088.

According to protective\nmeasurement, a charged quantum system has mass and charge density distributing\nin space, proportional to the modulus square of its wave function. In a\nrealistic interpretation, the wave function of a quantum system can be taken as\na description of either a physical field or the ergodic motion of a particle.\nIf the wave function is a physical field, then the mass and charge density will\nbe distributed throughout space at a given time for a charged quantum system,\nand thus there will exist gravitational and electrostatic self-interactions of\nits wave function. This not only violates the superposition principle of\nquantum mechanics but also contradicts experimental observations. Thus the wave\nfunction cannot be a description of a physical field but a description of the\nergodic motion of a particle. For the later there is only a localized particle\nwith mass and charge at every instant, and thus there will not exist any\nself-interaction for the wave function. It is further argued that the classical\nergodic models, which assume continuous motion of particles, cannot be\nconsistent with quantum mechanics. Based on the negative result, we suggest\nthat the wave function is a description of the quantum motion of particles,\nwhich is random and discontinuous in nature. On this interpretation, the\nmodulus square of the wave function not only gives the density of probability\nof the particle being found in certain locations, but also gives the density of\nobjective probability of the particle being there. We show that this new\ninterpretation of the wave function provides a natural realistic alternative to\nthe orthodox interpretation, and its implications for other realistic\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 02:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2011 11:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

This process occurs with near-perfect quantum\nefficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that\ncoherent energy transfer - a wavelike transfer mechanism - occurs in many\nphotosynthetic pigment-protein complexes (1-4). Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson\nantenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both\nincoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that\nenvironmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological\ntemperature; these studies further show that this process is equivalent to a\nquantum random walk algorithm (5-8). This theory requires long-lived quantum\ncoherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we\npresent the first evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at\nphysiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to perform a\nrudimentary quantum computational operation. This data proves that the\nwave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to\nbiological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime\nto correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores,\nand we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears\nconstant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and\nmediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations. The\npersistence of quantum coherence in a dynamic, disordered system under these\nconditions suggests a new biomimetic strategy for designing dedicated quantum\ncomputational devices that can operate at high temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 06:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

This paper gives a detailed description of our\nmethod, and shows its application on high-resolution images of active regions\nto retrieve a center-to-limb distribution of BPs and faculae.

In this Letter we\nstudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from IC 443 as obtained by the AGILE\nsatellite. A distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 MeV-3\nGeV is detected across the SNR with its prominent maximum (source \"A\")\nlocalized in the Northeastern shell with a flux F = (47 \\pm 10) 10^{-8} photons\ncm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 MeV. This location is the site of the strongest shock\ninteraction between the SNR blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.\nSource \"A\" is not coincident with the TeV source located 0.4 degree away and\nassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the SNR central region. From\nour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse TeV emission from its\nNortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters of\ngamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 GeV at the site of the strongest SNR shock. The\nintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominent\ngamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable TeV\nemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray acceleration\nin the SNR. A high-density molecular cloud (cloud \"E\") provides a remarkable\n\"target\" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results show\nenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shell\ninteraction site. IC 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-ray\nacceleration by SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 11:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The multi-epoch flux data in any two different bands obtained on the\nsame night show a very tight linear flux to flux relationship for all target\nAGNs. The flux of the host galaxy within the photometric aperture is carefully\nestimated by surface brightness fitting to available high-resolution HST images\nand MAGNUM images.

The trend of\nspectral hardening that optical continuum emission becomes bluer as it becomes\nbrighter, which has been reported by many studies, is therefore interpreted as\nthe domination of the variable component of the nearly constant spectral shape\nof an AGN as it brightens over the non-variable component of the host galaxy\nplus narrow lines, which is usually redder than AGN continuum emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 12:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

To quantitatively examine this hypothesis,\nwe calculate quasar luminosity functions (LFs) by manipulating the observed\ngalaxy LFs ($z\\lesssim 2$) and theoretical merger rates from semi-analytical\nformulations. We find that the model reproduces the observed quasar LFs\nprovided that the mass ratio ($q$) of the secondary galaxy to the newly formed\none changes with cosmic time. The results show that the fraction of major\nmergers decreases from $f_{\\rm maj}\\sim 0.2$ at $z\\sim 2$ to $f_{\\rm maj}\\to 0$\nat $z\\sim 0$. As a consequence, the newly formed SMBHs from major mergers at\n$z\\sim 2$ may acquire a maximal spin due to the orbital angular momentum of the\nmerging holes. Subsequently, random accretion led by minor mergers rapidly\ndrives the SMBHs to spin down. Such an evolutionary trend of the SMBH spins is\nconsistent with that radiative efficiency of accreting SMBHs strongly declines\nwith cosmic time, reported by Wang et al. (2009). This suggests that minor\nmergers are important in triggering activities of SMBHs at low redshift while\nmajor mergers may dominate at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 13:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-29"}

In this paper, we\nmodel different types of random network communications as the transmission of\nflats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us\nto introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding\n(RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously\nproposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we\nfirst evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in\nthe error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and\nthroughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of\npartial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC\noutperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more\nefficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible\nalterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which\ngeneralizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus\nreduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct\nmetrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of\ncodes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in\nparticular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on\nrank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The\ngain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 14:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 14:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In order for the - demanding in terms of QoS -\nFuture Internet services to be provided, the current trend is evolving towards\nan \"integrated\" wireless network access model that enables users to enjoy\nmobility, seamless access and high quality of service in an all-IP network on\nan \"Anytime, Anywhere\" basis. The term \"integrated\" is used to denote that the\nFuture Internet wireless \"last mile\" is expected to comprise multiple\nheterogeneous geographically coexisting wireless networks, each having\ndifferent capacity and coverage radius. The efficient management of the\nwireless access network resources is crucial due to their scarcity that renders\nwireless access a potential bottleneck for the provision of high quality\nservices. In this paper we propose an auction mechanism for allocating the\nbandwidth of such a network so that efficiency is attained, i.e. social welfare\nis maximized. In particular, we propose an incentive-compatible, efficient\nauction-based mechanism of low computational complexity. We define a repeated\ngame to address user utilities and incentives issues. Subsequently, we extend\nthis mechanism so that it can also accommodate multicast sessions. We also\nanalyze the computational complexity and message overhead of the proposed\nmechanism. We then show how user bids can be replaced from weights generated by\nthe network and transform the auction to a cooperative mechanism capable of\nprioritizing certain classes of services and emulating DiffServ and time-of-day\npricing schemes. The theoretical analysis is complemented by simulations that\nassess the proposed mechanisms properties and performance. We finally provide\nsome concluding remarks and directions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2010 15:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-29"}

If M<=0, D(M) is embedded and it is called unduloid, if M>0,\nD(M) is not embedded and it is called nodoid. These surfaces are called\nDelaunays and they are foliated by circles. The trace of the focus in the\nconstruction above is called the profile curve of the Delaunay and it is\ntransversal to the circles. Another well known family of constant mean\ncurvature surfaces are the Twizzlers, they are foliated by helices and we can\nnaturally define a profile curve which is transversal to the helices.
