We give a complete characterisation\n(except in the local termination detection case where a partial one is given)\nfor each of this termination detection and show that they define a strict\nhierarchy.

Adopting the\ninterpretation that in TOs a Low Luminosity AGN coexists with circumnuclear\nstar formation, the fraction of galaxies with an AGN could rise to 42% of the\nwhole sample. The low frequency (20%) of SFNs confirms that there is no star\nformation enhancement in HCGs. After extinction correction we found a median\nAGN H$\\alpha$ luminosity of 7.1$\\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which implies that\nAGNs in HCG have a characteristically low luminosity.

The optimized reduction of AA into two groups leads\nto hydrophobic and hydrophilic.

It is conjectured that\nkinetic equilibria of this type can exist which are able to sustain both\ntoroidal and poloidal electric current densities, the latter being produced via\nfinite Larmor-radius effects associated with the temperature anisotropy. This\nleads to the possibility of existence of a new kinetic effect - referred to\nhere as a \\textquotedblleft kinetic dynamo effect\\textquotedblright\\ -\nresulting in the self-generation of toroidal magnetic field even by a\nstationary plasma, without any net radial accretion flow being required. The\nconditions for these equilibria to occur, their basic theoretical features and\ntheir physical properties are all discussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 16:16:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2010 13:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We do not assume small\nperturbations. We examine propagating modes, permitting comparison of our\nresults to experimental data, and identify the steady component of the velocity\nfield that varies only in the wall-normal direction as the turbulent mean\nprofile. The \"optimal\" forcing shape, that gives the largest velocity response,\nis assumed to lead to modes that will be dominant and hence observed in\nturbulent pipe flow.\n  An investigation of the most amplified velocity response at a given\nwavenumber-frequency combination reveals critical layer-like behaviour\nreminiscent of the neutrally stable solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation in\nlinearly unstable flow. Two distinct regions in the flow where the influence of\nviscosity becomes important can be identified, namely a wall layer that scales\nwith $R^{+1/2}$ and a critical layer, where the propagation velocity is equal\nto the local mean velocity, that scales with $R^{+2/3}$ in pipe flow.

We analyze a model of viral competition\nbetween two different viral strains infecting a constantly replenished cell\npool, in which we assume a trade-off between the virus' colonization skills\n(cell killing ability or virulence) and its local competition skills\n(replication performance within coinfected cells). We characterize the\nconditions that allow for viral spread by means of the basic reproductive\nnumber and show that a local coexistence equilibrium exists, which is\nasymptotically stable. At this equilibrium, the less virulent competitor has a\nreproductive advantage over the more virulent colonizer. The equilibria at\nwhich one strain outcompetes the other one are unstable, i.e., a second viral\nstrain is always able to permanently invade. One generalization of the model is\nto consider multiple viral strains, each one displaying a different virulence.\nHowever, to account for the large phenotypic diversity in viral populations, we\nconsider a continuous spectrum of virulences and present a continuum limit of\nthis multiple viral strains model that describes the time evolution of an\ninitial continuous distribution of virulence. We provide a proof of the\nexistence of solutions of the model's equations and present numerical\napproximations of solutions for different initial distributions. Our\nsimulations suggest that initial continuous distributions of virulence evolve\ntowards a stationary distribution that is extremely skewed in favor of\ncompetitors. Consequently, collective virulence attenuation takes place.

The mean SED of NLS1s shows that in general this type of AGN appears\nto be fainter in the UV and at hard X-ray energies than BLS1s.

The scalar\nfield potential and coupling function are chosen such that the scalar field\nacquires a heavy mass in regions with high CDM density and thus behaves like a\nchameleon. We focus on how the existence of the scalar field affects the\nformation of nonlinear large-scale structure, and how the different couplings\nof the scalar field to baryons and CDM particles lead to different\ndistributions and evolutions for these two matter species, both on large scales\nand inside virialized halos. As expected, the baryon-CDM segregation increases\nin regions where the fifth force is strong, and little segregation in dense\nregions. We also introduce an approximation method to identify the virialized\nhalos in coupled scalar field models which takes into account the scalar field\ncoupling and which is easy to implement numerically. It is find that the\nchameleon nature of the scalar field makes the internal density profiles of\nhalos dependent on the environment in a very nontrivial way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2010 21:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 May 2010 20:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-04"}

It is found that the legality debate of the auction had\nmarginal transient impact on the average price in a short time period. In\ncontrast, the change of the auction rules has significant permanent influence\non the average price, which reduces the price by about 3020 yuan Renminbi. It\nmeans that the average price exhibits nonlinear behaviors with a regime change.\nThe evolution of the average price is independent of the number\n$N_{\\rm{bidder}}$ of bidders in both regimes. In the early regime before\nJanuary 2008, the average price $P_{\\rm{mean}}$ was influenced only by the\nminimal price $P_{\\min}$ in the preceding month with a positive correlation. In\nthe current regime since January 2008, the average price is positively\ncorrelated with the minimal price and the quota in the preceding month and\nnegatively correlated with the quota in the same month. We test the predictive\npower of the two models using 2-year and 3-year moving windows and find that\nthe latter outperforms the former. It seems that the auction market becomes\nmore efficient after the auction reform since the prediction error increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 00:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-08"}

Here we\nconduct a first test of the Witten effect, based on the recently established\nfact that the axion term with theta=pi emerges naturally in the description of\nthe electromagnetic response of a new class of crystalline solids called\ntopological insulators - materials distinguished by strong spin-orbit coupling\nand non-trivial band structure. Using a simple physical model for a topological\ninsulator, we demonstrate the existence of a fractional charge bound to a\nmonopole by an explicit numerical calculation.

However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of\nthe diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other\ntypes of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been\ndone to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of\nonline social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to\ninvestigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social\nnetworks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on\nlarge-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous\nresearch results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make\nthe information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal.\nHowever, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the\ninformation will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also\ngive a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments.\nFinally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information\ndiffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to\nconnect isolated local communities together and break through the local\ntrapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential\npaths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network.\nAs a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and\nthe private information diffusion in real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 02:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2010 03:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

An analysis of the Gnevyshev gap is conducted\nto determine if the double-peak is caused by the averaging of two hemispheres\nthat are out of phase. We confirm previous findings that the Gnevyshev gap is a\nphenomenon that occurs in the separate hemispheres and is not due to a\nsuperposition of sunspot indices from hemispheres slightly out of phase. Cross\nhemispheric coupling could be strongest at solar minimum, when there are large\nquantities of magnetic flux at the Equator. We search for a correlation between\nthe hemispheric phase difference near the end of the solar cycle and the length\nof solar-cycle minimum, but found none. Because magnetic flux diffusion across\nthe Equator is a mechanism by which the hemispheres couple, we measured the\nmagnetic flux crossing the Equator by examining magnetograms for Solar Cycles\n21 - 23.

The current methods of flow estimation, based on\nDarcy's Law and the groundwater flow equation, can be described by the\ndiffusion equation (the transient flow) and the Laplace equation (the\nsteady-state flow). The Laplace equation is a simplification of the diffusion\nequation under the condition that the aquifer has a recharging boundary. The\npractical way of calculation is to use numerical methods to solve these\nequations. The most popular system is called MODFLOW, which was developed by\nUSGS. MODFLOW is based on the finite-difference method in rectangular Cartesian\ncoordinates. MODFLOW can be viewed as a \"quasi 3D\" simulation since it only\ndeals with the vertical average (no z-direction derivative). Flow calculations\nbetween the 2D horizontal layers use the concept of leakage. In this project,\nwe have established a mathematical model based on gradually varied functions\nfor groundwater data volume reconstruction.

The CB average beampattern expresses a deterministic\nbehavior and can be used for characterizing/controling the transmission at\nintended direction(s), since the mainlobe of the CB beampattern is independent\non the particular random node locations. However, the CB for a cluster formed\nby a limited number of collaborative nodes results in a sample beampattern with\nsidelobes that severely depend on the particular node locations. High level\nsidelobes can cause unacceptable interference when they occur at directions of\nunintended BSs/APs. Therefore, sidelobe control in CB has a potential to\nincrease the network capacity and wireless channel availability by decreasing\nthe interference. Traditional sidelobe control techniques are proposed for\ncentralized antenna arrays and, therefore, are not suitable for WSNs. In this\npaper, we show that distributed, scalable, and low-complexity sidelobe control\ntechniques suitable for CB in WSNs can be developed based on node selection\ntechnique which make use of the randomness of the node locations.

For the\ndecelerator to work, it is essential that the molecules follow the changing\nelectric field adiabatically. When the decelerator switches from one\nconfiguration to the other, the electric field changes in magnitude and\ndirection, and this can cause molecules to change state. In places where the\nfield is weak, the rotation of the electric field vector during the switch may\nbe too rapid for the molecules to maintain their orientation relative to the\nfield. Molecules that are at these places when the field switches may be lost\nfrom the decelerator as they are transferred into states that are not focussed.\nWe calculate the probability of nonadiabatic transitions as a function of\nposition in the periodic decelerator structure and find that for the\ndecelerated group of molecules the loss is typically small, while for the\nun-decelerated group of molecules the loss can be very high. This loss can be\neliminated using a bias field to ensure that the electric field magnitude is\nalways large enough.

This new layer\nmakes it possible to model global effects such as salience, at the same time as\nthe local network processes task-specific or local information. This simple\ncombination network displays interactions between salience and regular\nprocessing which correspond to known effects in the developing brain, such as\nenhanced learning as a result of heightened affect.\n  The cortex biases neuronal responses to affect both learning and memory,\nthrough the use of diffuse projections from the limbic system to the cortex.\nStandard ANNs do not model this non-local flow of information represented by\nthe ascending systems, which are a significant feature of the structure of the\nbrain, and although they do allow associational learning with multiple-trial,\nthey simply don't provide the capacity for one-time learning.\n  In this research we model this effect using an artificial neural network\n(ANN), creating a salience-affected neural network (SANN).

This subclass\nof perfect graphs has been extensively studied, due to both its interesting\nstructure and its numerous applications. Several efficient algorithms for\noptimization problems that are NP-hard on general graphs have been designed for\ntolerance graphs. In spite of this, the recognition of tolerance graphs -\nnamely, the problem of deciding whether a given graph is a tolerance graph - as\nwell as the recognition of their main subclass of bounded tolerance graphs,\nhave been the most fundamental open problems on this class of graphs (cf. the\nbook on tolerance graphs \\cite{GolTol04}) since their introduction in 1982\n\\cite{GoMo82}. In this article we prove that both recognition problems are\nNP-complete, even in the case where the input graph is a trapezoid graph. The\npresented results are surprising because, on the one hand, most subclasses of\nperfect graphs admit polynomial recognition algorithms and, on the other hand,\nbounded tolerance graphs were believed to be efficiently recognizable as they\nare a natural special case of trapezoid graphs (which can be recognized in\npolynomial time) and share a very similar structure with them.

Such avalanches have been\nclaimed to be generically scale-invariant -- i.e. power-law distributed -- with\nmany exciting implications in Neuroscience. Recently, a self-organized model\nhas been proposed by Levina, Herrmann and Geisel to justify such an empirical\nfinding. Given that (i) neural dynamics is dissipative and (ii) there is a\nloading mechanism \"charging\" progressively the background synaptic strength,\nthis model/dynamics is very similar in spirit to forest-fire and earthquake\nmodels, archetypical examples of non-conserving self-organization, which have\nbeen recently shown to lack true criticality. Here we show that cortical neural\nnetworks obeying (i) and (ii) are not generically critical; unless parameters\nare fine tuned, their dynamics is either sub- or super-critical, even if the\npseudo-critical region is relatively broad. This conclusion seems to be in\nagreement with the most recent experimental observations. The main implication\nof our work is that, if future experimental research on cortical networks were\nto support that truly critical avalanches are the norm and not the exception,\nthen one should look for more elaborate (adaptive/evolutionary) explanations,\nbeyond simple self-organization, to account for this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 10:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

(2006) sample. When the asymmetry effect is taken into account\nfor this sample of stars, the resulting 6Li/7Li ratios are reduced by about\n1.5% on average with respect to the isotopic ratios determined by Asplund et\nal. (2006). This purely theoretical correction diminishes the number of\nsignificant 6Li detections from 9 to 4 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3\nsigma criterion). In view of this result the existence of a 6Li plateau appears\nquestionable. A careful reanalysis of individual objects by fitting the\nobserved lithium 6707 A doublet both with 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic line\nprofiles confirms that the inferred 6Li abundance is systematically lower when\nusing 3D NLTE instead of 1D LTE line fitting. Nevertheless, halo stars with\nunquestionable 6Li detection do exist even if analyzed in 3D-NLTE, the most\nprominent example being HD 84937.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 12:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

High-energy gamma rays\ntrace particle acceleration processes and gamma-ray observations allow the\nnature and sites of acceleration to be studied. Aims: We characterise the\ndistribution and sources of cosmic rays in the LMC from analysis of gamma-ray\nobservations. Methods: We analyse 11 months of continuous sky-survey\nobservations obtained with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope and compare it to tracers of the interstellar medium and models\nof the gamma-ray sources in the LMC. Results: The LMC is detected at 33 sigma\nsignificance. The integrated >100 MeV photon flux of the LMC amounts to (2.6\n+/- 0.2) * 10^-7 ph/cm2/s which corresponds to an energy flux of (1.6 +/- 0.1)\n* 10^-10 erg/cm2/s, with additional systematic uncertainties of ~16%.

The gamma-ray emission from the LMC shows\nvery little correlation with gas density and is rather correlated to tracers of\nmassive star forming regions. The close confinement of gamma-ray emission to\nstar forming regions suggests a relatively short GeV cosmic-ray proton\ndiffusion length. Conclusions: The close correlation between cosmic-ray density\nand massive star tracers supports the idea that cosmic rays are accelerated in\nmassive star forming regions as a result of the large amounts of kinetic energy\nthat are input by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of massive stars\ninto the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 13:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

These\nnanodetectors can also be operated in multi-photon mode, where the detection\nthreshold can be set at N=1, 2, 3 or 4 photons, thus allowing the mapping of\nphoton number statistics on the nanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 15:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-20"}

In\naddition, their atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity\nand microturbulent velocity) and surface nitrogen abundances have been\nestimated using a non-LTE grid of model atmospheres. Comparisons of the\nprojected rotational velocities have been made with the predictions of stellar\nevolutionary models and in general good agreement was found. However for a\nsmall number of targets, their observed rotational velocities were\nsignificantly larger than predicted, although their nitrogen abundances were\nconsistent with the rest of the sample. We conclude that binarity may have\nplayed a role in generating their large rotational velocities. No correlation\nwas found between nitrogen abundances and the current projected rotational\nvelocities. However a correlation was found with the inferred projected\nrotational velocities of the main sequence precursors of our supergiant sample.\nThis correlation is again in agreement with the predictions of single star\nevolutionary models that incorporate rotational mixing. The origin of the\nmacroturbulent and microturbulent velocity fields is discussed and our results\nsupport previous theoretical studies that link the former to sub-photospheric\nconvection and the latter to non-radial gravity mode oscillations. In addition,\nwe have attempted to identify differential rotation in our most rapidly\nrotating targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 15:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

On the\nother hand, compared to lasers, the quasiparticles are generally more strongly\ninteracting, and therefore better able to thermalise. This leads to questions\nof how to describe such non-equilibrium condensates, and their relation to\nequilibrium condensates and lasers. This chapter discusses in detail how the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function approach can be applied to the description of\nsuch a non-equilibrium condensate, in particular, a system of microcavity\npolaritons, driven out of equilibrium by coupling to multiple baths. By\nconsidering the steady states, and fluctuations about them, it is possible to\nprovide a description that relates both to equilibrium condensation and to\nlasing, while at the same time, making clear the differences from simple\nlasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 10:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-17"}

The Maslov indices of orbits\nwithin multiplets of degenerate length either yield equal phases for the\nrespective Feynman amplitudes (and thus Poissonian level statistics) or give\nrise to amplitudes with uncorrelated phases (leading to Wigner-Dyson level\ncorrelations).
