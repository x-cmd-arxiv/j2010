We investigate trends with type and color for the planning and\ninterpretation of surveys for the coldest T or Y dwarfs. Brown dwarfs with\neffective temperature (T_eff) below 700K emit more than half their flux at\nwavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to the\nnear-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to T_eff. The color H-[4.5] is a good\nindicator of T_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity and\ngravity. Conversely, the colors H-K and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive to\nmetallicity and gravity. Thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide useful\nindicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperature\nand gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionary\nmodels. There are twelve dwarfs known with H-[4.5]>3.0, and 500< T_eff K < 800,\nwhich we examine in detail. The ages of these dwarfs range from very young\n(0.1-1.0 Gyr) to relatively old (3-12 Gyr).

Such `superexpansions' imply a large and rapid\nenergy release, a feature characteristic of pure He burst models. Previous\ncalculations have shown that during a pure He burst, the freshly synthesized\nheavy-element ashes of burning can be ejected in a strong radiative wind and\nproduce significant spectral absorption features. We search the burst data\ncatalogs and literature and find 32 superexpansion bursts. We find that these\nbursts exhibit the following interesting features: (1) At least 31 are from\n(candidate) ultracompact X-ray binaries in which the neutron star accretes\nhydrogen-deficient fuel, suggesting that these bursts indeed ignite in a\nhelium-rich layer. (2) In 2 bursts we detect strong absorption edges during the\nexpansion phase. The edge energies and depths are consistent with the H-like or\nHe-like edge of iron-peak elements with abundances greater than 100 times\nsolar, suggesting that we are seeing the exposed ashes of nuclear burning. (3)\nThe superexpansion phase is always followed by a moderate expansion phase\nduring which r_ph ~ 30 km and the luminosity is near the Eddington limit. (4)\nThe decay time of the bursts, t_d, ranges from short (approximately 10 s) to\nintermediate (>~ 1000 s). However, despite the large range of t_d, the duration\nof the superexpansion is always a few seconds, independent of t_d. By contrast,\nthe duration of the moderate expansion is always of order t_d. (5) The\nphotospheric radii r_ph during the moderate expansion phase are much smaller\nthan steady state wind models predict. We show that this may be further\nindication that the wind contains highly non-solar abundances of heavy\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 19:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 11:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The mu-tau breaking is not only\nsmall, but also the source of Dirac CP-violation. We conjecture that both\ndiscrete mu-tau and CP symmetries are fundamental symmetries of the seesaw\nLagrangian (respected by interaction terms), and they are only softly broken,\narising from a common origin via a unique dimension-3 Majorana mass-term of the\nheavy right-handed neutrinos. From this conceptually attractive and simple\nconstruction, we can predict the soft mu-tau breaking at low energies, leading\nto quantitative correlations between the apparently two small deviations\n\\theta_{23} - 45^o and \\theta_{13} - 0^o. This nontrivially connects the\non-going measurements of mixing angle \\theta_{23} with the upcoming\nexperimental probes of \\theta_{13}. We find that any deviation of \\theta_{23} -\n45^o must put a lower limit on \\theta_{13}. Furthermore, we deduce the low\nenergy Dirac and Majorana CP violations from a common soft-breaking phase\nassociated with mu-tau breaking in the neutrino seesaw. Finally, from the soft\nCP breaking in neutrino seesaw we derive the cosmological CP violation for the\nbaryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. We fully reconstruct the leptogenesis\nCP-asymmetry from the low energy Dirac CP phase and establish a direct link\nbetween the cosmological CP-violation and the low energy Jarlskog invariant. We\npredict new lower and upper bounds on the \\theta_{13} mixing angle, 1^o <\n\\theta_{13} < 6^o.

Testing on yeast\nproteins, our results show that SimIC efficiently addresses the shallow\nannotation issue in GO, thus improves the correlations between GO similarities\nof yeast proteins and their expression similarities as well as between GO\nsimilarities of yeast proteins and their sequence similarities. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed SimIC is superior in predicting yeast protein\ninteractions.

Since radiation feedback from embedded stars\ncan modify this as collapse proceeds, feedback plays an important role in\ndetermining the IMF. However, the effects and importance of radiative heating\nare likely to depend strongly on the surface density of the collapsing clouds,\nwhich determines both their effectiveness at trapping radiation and the\naccretion luminosities of the stars forming within them. In this paper we\nreport a suite of adaptive mesh refinement radiation-hydrodynamic simulations\nusing the ORION code in which we isolate the effect of column density on\nfragmentation by following the collapse of clouds of varying column density\nwhile holding the mass, initial density and velocity structure, and initial\nvirial ratio fixed.

In regions of low surface density, fragmentation during collapse\nleads to the formation of small clusters rather than individual massive star\nsystems, greatly reducing the fraction of the stellar population with masses >~\n10 Msun.

The interpretation of the features as a\ncyclotron line and its harmonics has been suggested, but the usual explanation\nof the harmonics as caused by relativistic effects fails because the\nrelativistic corrections are extremely small in this case. We suggest that the\nfeatures correspond to the peaks in the energy dependence of the free-free\nopacity in a quantizing magnetic field, known as quantum oscillations. The\npeaks arise when the transitions to new Landau levels become allowed with\nincreasing the photon energy; they are strongly enhanced by the square-root\nsingularities in the phase-space density of quantum states in the case when the\nfree (non-quantized) motion is effectively one-dimensional.

The color-magnitude relation, interpreted as a mass-metallicity\nrelation, is thought to be a consequence of self-enrichment. Nonlinear\ncolor-metallicity relations have been shown to produce bimodal color\ndistributions from unimodal metallicity distributions. We simulate GC\npopulations including both a mass-metallicity scaling relation and nonlinear\ncolor-metallicity relations motivated by theory and observations. Depending on\nthe assumed range of metallicities and the width of the GC luminosity function\n(GCLF), we find that the simulated populations can have bimodal color\ndistributions with a \"blue tilt\" similar to observations, even though the\nmetallicity distribution appears unimodal. The models that produce these\nfeatures have the relatively high mean GC metallicities and nearly equal blue\nand red peaks characteristic of giant elliptical galaxies. The blue tilt is\nless apparent in the models with metallicities typical of dwarf ellipticals;\nthe narrower GCLF in these galaxies has an even bigger effect in reducing the\nsignificance of their color-magnitude slopes.

Interestingly, the geometrical set up of braneworlds is quite\nsimilar to that in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Hence, it is legitimate to seek\na precise relation between these two different frameworks. In this lecture, I\nwill explain how the AdS/CFT correspondence is related to the RS braneworld\nmodels. There are two different versions of RS braneworlds, namely, the\nsingle-brane model and the two-brane model. In the case of the single-brane\nmodel, we reveal the relation between the geometrical and the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence approach using the gradient expansion method. It turns out that\nthe high energy and the Weyl term corrections found in the geometrical approach\ncorrespond to the CFT matter correction found in the AdS/CFT correspondence\napproach. In the case of two-brane system, we also show that the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence plays an important role in the sense that the low energy\neffective field theory can be described by the conformally coupled\nscalar-tensor theory where the radion plays the role of the scalar field.

Comparison of transport and magnetization\nmeasurements has revealed the onset of a regime where large differences exist\nbetween transport and magnetically measured values of the critical current\ndensity and Birr. These effects, initially unexpected due to the lack of\ncrystalline texture in these in-situ processed strands, appear to be due to a\nfibrous microstructure, connected with the details of the wire fabrication and\nMgB2 formation reactions. Scanning electron micrographs of in-situ-processed\nMgB2 monocore strands have revealed a fibrous microstructure. Grains (~100 nm)\nare randomly oriented, and there is no apparent local texture of the grains.\nHowever, this randomly oriented polycrystalline material has a fibrous texture\nat a larger length scale, with stringers of MgB2 (~ 60 {\\mu}m long and ~5\n{\\mu}m in diameter) partially separated by elongated pores -- the spaces\npreviously occupied by stringers of elemental Mg. This leads to an\ninterpretation of the differences observed in transport and magnetically\ndetermined critical currents, in particular a large deviation between the two\nat higher fields, in terms of different transverse and longitudinal\nconnectivities within the strand. The different values of connectivity also\nlead to different resistive transition widths, and thus irreversibility field\nvalues, as measured by transport and magnetic techniques. Finally, these\nconsiderations are seen to influence estimated pinning potentials for the\nstrands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 06:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We have shown the possibility of\ncharacterizing the bisimulation of two processes with the isomorphism of their\ncorresponding seed algebras. We pointed out that the traditional concept of\nisomorphism of algebra does not apply here, because there is even no one-one\ncorrespondence between the elements of two seed algebras. The lack of this\none-one correspondence comes from the non-deterministic choice of transitions\nof a process. We introduce a technique of hidden operations to mask unwanted\ndetails of elements of a seed algebra, which only reflect non-determinism or\nother implicit control mechanism of process transition. Elements of a seed\nalgebra are considered as indistinguishable if they show the same behavior\nafter these unwanted details are masked. Each class of indistinguishable\nelements is called a non-hidden closure. We proved that bisimulation of two\nprocesses is equivalent to isomorphism of non-hidden closures of two seed\nalgebras representing these two processes. We call this kind of isomorphism a\ndeep isomorphism. We get different models of seed algebra by specifying\ndifferent axiom systems for the same signature.

A widely accepted method to circumvent\nthis problem consists in replacing cpu time expensive computer models by cpu\ninexpensive mathematical functions, called metamodels. In this paper, we focus\non the Gaussian process metamodel and two essential steps of its definition\nphase. First, the initial design of the computer code input variables (which\nallows to fit the metamodel) has to honor adequate space filling properties. We\nadopt a numerical approach to compare the performance of different types of\nspace filling designs, in the class of the optimal Latin hypercube samples, in\nterms of the predictivity of the subsequent fitted metamodel. We conclude that\nsuch samples with minimal wrap-around discrepancy are particularly well-suited\nfor the Gaussian process metamodel fitting. Second, the metamodel validation\nprocess consists in evaluating the metamodel predictivity with respect to the\ninitial computer code. We propose and test an algorithm which optimizes the\ndistance between the validation points and the metamodel learning points in\norder to estimate the true metamodel predictivity with a minimum number of\nvalidation points. Comparisons with classical validation algorithms and\napplication to a nuclear safety computer code show the relevance of this new\nsequential validation design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 10:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 11:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-22"}

I show how SR can be indeed derived from causality of QT, within the\ncomputational paradigm \"the universe is a huge quantum computer\", reformulating\nQFT as a Quantum-Computational Field Theory (QCFT). In QCFT SR emerges from the\nfabric of the computational network, which also naturally embeds gauge\ninvariance. In this scheme even the quantization rule and the Planck constant\ncan in principle be derived as emergent from the underlying causal tapestry of\nspace-time. In this way QT remains the only theory operating the huge computer\nof the universe. Is QCFT only a speculative tautology (theory as simulation of\nreality), or does it have a scientific value? The answer will come from Occam's\nrazor, depending on the mathematical simplicity of QCFT. Here I will just start\nscratching the surface of QCFT, analyzing simple field theories, including\nDirac's.

These trial functions, referred to as rovibrational molecular (RVM)\nfunctions, generalize our previous work which focused exclusively on electronic\ncusp states, describing them as pure vibrationless rotations. From a\ncomputational viewpoint, the RVM correlated basis enables controlled and\nsystematic improvements of the original strongly-correlated variational wave\nfunction. Conceptually, it provides the basis for the development of a quantal\nmolecular description for the full LLL spectra. This quantal molecular\ndescription is universal, being valid for both bosons and fermions, for both\nthe yrast and excited states of the LLL spectra, and for both low and high\nangular momenta. Furthermore, it follows that all other translationally\ninvariant trial functions (e.g., the Jastrow-Laughlin, compact\ncomposite-fermion, or Moore-Read functions) are reducible to a description in\nterms of an excited rotating/vibrating quantal molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 15:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

Recently, the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant. Here we\nreport that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in\nM30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during\nwhich both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems\nwould have been enhanced.
