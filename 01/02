A moderation\nincentive is identically zero on the boundary of the admissible control region\nand non-negative on the interior; it is bounded above by the infimum of the\nstate-dependent cost function, so that the instantaneous total cost is always\nnon-negative. The conservation law determined by the Maximum Principle, in\ncombination with the condition that the moderation incentive equal zero on the\nboundary of the admissible control region, plays a crucial role in the\nanalysis; in some situations, the initial and final values of the auxiliary\nvariable are uniquely determined by the condition that the conserved quantity\nequal zero along a solution of the arbitrary duration synthesis problem. Use of\nan alternate system of evolution equations, parametrized by the auxiliary\nvariable, for one-degree of freedom controlled acceleration systems, can\nsignificantly simplify numerical searches for solutions of the arbitrary\nduration synthesis problem. A one-parameter family of 'elliptical' moderation\nincentives is introduced; the behavior of the well-known quadratic control cost\nand its incentive analog is compared to that of the elliptical incentives in\ntwo simple controlled acceleration examples. The elliptical incentives yield\nsmooth solutions with controls remaining in the interior of the admissible\nregion, while the quadratic incentive allows piecewise smooth solutions with\ncontrols moving on and off the boundary of the admissible region; in these\nexamples, the arbitrary duration synthesis problem for the traditional\nquadratic control cost has no solution; the total cost is a monotonically\ndecreasing function of the duration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2010 20:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

For example,\norder barriers for stable LMF and the problem of order reduction for RK\nmethods. Nevertheless, these goals are usually achieved at the price of a\nhigher computational cost. Consequently, many efforts have been made in order\nto derive GLMs with particular features, to be exploited for their efficient\nimplementation. In recent years, the derivation of GLMs from particular\nBoundary Value Methods (BVMs), namely the family of Generalized BDF (GBDF), has\nbeen proposed for the numerical solution of stiff ODE-IVPs. In particular, this\napproach has been recently developed, resulting in a new family of L-stable\nGLMs of arbitrarily high order, whose theory is here completed and fully\nworked-out. Moreover, for each one of such methods, it is possible to define a\ncorresponding Blended GLM which is equivalent to it from the point of view of\nthe stability and order properties.

Assuming that the\napparent horizon has Hawking temperature, the modified entropy-area relation is\nobtained, we find that this relation is different from the one which is\nobtained by considering the holonomy correction. Considering the dark energy is\na thermal equilibrium fluid, we get the expressions for modified temperature,\nchemical potential and entropy. The temperature, chemical potential and entropy\nare well-defined in the semiclassical regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2010 14:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 15:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-22"}

[Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{72}, 036121 (2005)] have studied the\nbalance dynamics on the social networks. In this paper, based on the model\nproposed by Antal et al., we improve it and generalize the binary social\nnetworks to the ternary social networks. When the social networks get\ndynamically balanced, we obtain the distributions of each relation and the time\nneeded for dynamic balance. Besides, we study the self-organized criticality on\nthe ternary social networks based on our model. For the ternary social networks\nevolving to the sensitive state, any small disturbance may result in an\navalanche. The occurrence of the avalanche satisfies the power-law form both\nspatially and temporally. Numerical results verify our theoretical\nexpectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2010 15:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-05"}

This work aims to better\nunderstand the emission line shifts. Positions of strong emission lines were\nmeasured on archival UV spectra of Z And, AG Dra, RW Hya, SY Mus and AX Per and\nrelative shifts between the lines of different ions compared. Profiles of lines\nof RW Hya and Z And were also examined. The reality of the relative shift\nbetween resonance and intercombination lines of several times ionised atoms was\nclearly shown except for AG Dra. This redshift shows a well defined variation\nwith orbital phase for Z And and RW Hya. In addition the intercombination lines\nfrom more ionised atoms and especially OIV are redshifted with respect to those\nfrom less ionised atoms. Other effects are seen in the profiles. The\nresonance-intercombination line shift variation can be explained in quiescence\nby P Cygni shorter wavelength component absorption, due to the wind of the cool\ncomponent, which is specially strong in inferior conjunction of this cool\ngiant. The velocity stratification permits absorption of line emission. The\nrelative intercombination line shifts may be connected with varying occultation\nof line emission near an accretion disk, which is optically thick in the\ncontinuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2010 15:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
