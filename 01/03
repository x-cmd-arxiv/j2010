Here, the recent experimental data from ion-implanted Si NCs is\nunambiguously explained within the context of QCSE using an atomistic\npseudopotential theory. This further reveals that the majority of the Stark\nshift comes from the valence states which undergo a level crossing that leads\nto a nonmonotonic radiative recombination behavior with respect to the applied\nfield. The polarizability of embedded Si NCs including the excitonic effects is\nextracted over a diameter range of 2.5--6.5 nm, which displays a cubic scaling,\n$\\alpha=c D^3$, with $c=2.436\\times 10^{-11}$ C/(Vm), where $D$ is the NC\ndiameter. Finally, based on intraband electroabsorption analysis, it is\npredicted that p-doped Si NCs will show substantial voltage tunability, whereas\nn-doped samples should be almost insensitive. Given the fact that bulk silicon\nlacks the linear electro-optic effect as being a centrosymmetric crystal, this\nmay offer a viable alternative for electrical modulation using p-doped Si NCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2010 08:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 06:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-23"}

Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm.\nThe high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge\nof how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation.\nThis information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF),\ndefined as the composite of Kepler's optical point spread function, integrated\nspacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic\neffects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a\npiecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh.

The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial\nrepresentation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation\nin the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial\npatches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler\nfield of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection\nof pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratio\nfor that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate\nstellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale\ntracking. Good knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the\nsuccessful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2010 20:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 20:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Presently, the EOS of neutron-rich matter is\nstill very uncertain mainly due to the poorly known density dependence of the\nnuclear symmetry energy especially at supra-saturation densities. Nevertheless,\nsignificant progress has been made recently in constraining the density\ndependence of the nuclear symmetry energy mostly at sub-saturation densities\nusing terrestrial nuclear reactions.
