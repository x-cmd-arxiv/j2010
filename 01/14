Among the first applications anticipated to\nbear fruit is quantum simulation of quantum systems. While most quantum\ncomputation is an extension of classical digital computation, quantum\nsimulation differs fundamentally in how the data is encoded in the quantum\ncomputer. To perform a quantum simulation, the Hilbert space of the system to\nbe simulated is mapped directly onto the Hilbert space of the (logical) qubits\nin the quantum computer. This type of direct correspondence is how data is\nencoded in a classical analogue computer. There is no binary encoding, and\nincreasing precision becomes exponentially costly: an extra bit of precision\ndoubles the size of the computer. This has important consequences for both the\nprecision and error correction requirements of quantum simulation, and\nsignificant open questions remain about its practicality. It also means that\nthe quantum version of analogue computers, continuous variable quantum\ncomputers (CVQC) becomes an equally efficient architecture for quantum\nsimulation.

However, the restoration of\nthese images using state-of-the-art regularizers (such as those based on\nmultiscale representations or total variation) is still an active research\narea, since the associated optimization problems are quite challenging. In this\npaper, we propose an approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, which is based\non an alternating direction optimization method. The standard regularization\n(or maximum a posteriori) restoration criterion, which combines the Poisson\nlog-likelihood with a (non-smooth) convex regularizer (log-prior), leads to\nhard optimization problems: the log-likelihood is non-quadratic and\nnon-separable, the regularizer is non-smooth, and there is a non-negativity\nconstraint. Using standard convex analysis tools, we present sufficient\nconditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of these optimization\nproblems, for several types of regularizers: total-variation, frame-based\nanalysis, and frame-based synthesis. We attack these problems with an instance\nof the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which belongs to the\nfamily of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. We study sufficient conditions for\nconvergence and show that these are satisfied, either under total-variation or\nframe-based (analysis and synthesis) regularization.

OFDM is very effective in combating\nintersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective\nchannel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio\nchannels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter\nCarrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus\ndegrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its\nsensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier\nfrequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one\nis the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to\neach of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other\ncarriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating\nthe effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nestimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. These three methods are\ncompared in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.\nThrough simulations, it is shown that the three techniques are effective in\nmitigating the modulation schemes, the ML and EKF methods perform better than\nthe SC method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 18:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-14"}

It is always desirable to have a bridge between gauge\ninvariant and noninvariant theories. Once established, this kind of mapping\nbetween first-class (gauge invariant) and second-class systems, in Dirac's\nformalism can be considered as a sort of duality. In this paper we investigate\nthis \"duality\" obtaining a gauge invariant theory starting with a noninvariant\none. We analyzed both Abelian and non-Abelian theories and the procedure used\nis the recent dual (also called symplectic) embedding formalism. We believe\nthat this method is the most convenient one since it is not plagued by the\nambiguity problems that torments BFFT and other iterative methods. We\ndemonstrated exactly that this \"dualization\" method used here does not require\nany special modification to handle with non-Abelian systems, which is also a\nnew result described in this paper. To prove the gauge invariance we used just\nthe Dirac constraint technique.

From the study of the minimization of the scalar potential we found a\nresidual mu-tau symmetry in the neutrino sector predicting zero reactor angle\nand maximal atmospheric angle and for the quark sector we found a four-zero\ntexture. We give a fit of the mass hierarchies and mixing angles in the quark\nsector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 18:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2010 16:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2010 09:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-22"}

Three different methods\nto study the collected charge as a function of the drift time have been\nimplemented. The first approach consists in measuring the charge at different\ninjection distances moving an infrared laser by means of micrometric step\nmotors. The second method is based on the measurement of the charge injected by\nthe laser at fixed drift distance and varying the drift field, thus changing\nthe drift time. In the last method, the measurement of the charge deposited by\natmospheric muons is used to study the charge collection efficiency as a\nfunction of the drift time. The three methods gave consistent results and\nindicated that no charge loss during the drift is observed for the sensor types\nused in 99% of the SDD modules mounted on the ALICE Inner Tracking System. The\natmospheric muons have also been used to test the effect of the\nzero-suppression applied to reduce the data size by erasing the counts in cells\nnot passing the thresholds for noise removal.

Specifically, we\nprove that connective algebraic K-theory is the universal additive invariant,\ni.e., the universal functor with values in spectra which inverts Morita\nequivalences, preserves filtered colimits, and satisfies Waldhausen's\nadditivity theorem. Similarly, we prove that non-connective algebraic K-theory\nis the universal localizing invariant, i.e., the universal functor that\nmoreover satisfies the \"Thomason-Trobaugh-Neeman\" localization theorem.\n  To prove these results, we construct and study two stable infinity categories\nof \"noncommutative motives\"; one associated to additivity and another to\nlocalization. In these stable infinity categories, Waldhausen's S. construction\ncorresponds to the suspension functor and connective and non-connective\nalgebraic K-theory spectra become corepresentable by the noncommutative motive\nof the sphere spectrum. In particular, the algebraic K-theory of every scheme,\nstack, and ring spectrum can be recovered from these categories of\nnoncommutative motives.\n  In order to work with these categories of noncommutative motives, we\nestablish comparison theorems between the category of spectral categories\nlocalized at the Morita equivalences and the category of small\nidempotent-complete stable infinity categories. We also explain in detail the\ncomparison between the infinity categorical version of Waldhausen K-theory and\nthe classical definition.\n  As an application of our theory, we obtain a complete classification of the\nnatural transformations from higher algebraic K-theory to topological\nHochschild homology (THH) and topological cyclic homology (TC). Notably, we\nobtain an elegant conceptual description of the cyclotomic trace map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 20:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 18:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 23:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

The focus on a subsample of 1658 galaxies with highest S/N\nobservations enables us to investigate most clearly several strong correlations\nbetween various derived physical properties of galaxies.

A comparison with recent models of chemical and dust evolution of\ngalaxies suggests that these correlations could arise, at least in part, from\nan evolutionary sequence. As galaxies form stars, their ISM becomes enriched in\ndust, while the drop in gas supply makes the specific SFR decrease.\nInterestingly, as a result, a young, actively star-forming galaxy with low\ndust-to-gas ratio may still be highly dusty because it contains large amounts\nof interstellar gas.

In contrast to the case\nwith strong MgII absorption systems W_0 > 0.3 \\AA, the weaker systems do not\ncontribute significantly to the observed Rotation Measure of the background\nquasars. This is possibly due to the higher impact parameters of the weak\nsystems compared to strong ones, suggesting that the high column density\nmagnetized material that is responsible for the Faraday Rotation is located\nwithin about 50 kpc of the galaxies. Finally, we show that this result also\nrules out the possibility that some unexpected secondary correlation between\nthe quasar redshift and its intrinsic Rotation Measure is responsible for the\nassociation of high Rotation Measure and strong intervening MgII absorption\nthat we have presented elsewhere, since this would have produced an equal\neffect for the weak absorption line systems, which exhibit a very similar\ndistribution of quasar redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 21:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In particular, we consider\na general N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The anomaly puzzle concerns the\nquestion of whether there is a consistent way to put the R-current and the\nstress tensor in a single supercurrent, even though in the classical theory\nthey are in the same supermultiplet. As is well known, the classically\nconserved supercurrent bifurcates into two supercurrents having different\nanomalies in the quantum regime. The most interesting result we obtain is an\nexplicit expression for the lowest component of one of the two supercurrents in\n4-dimensional spacetime, namely the supercurrent that has the energy-momentum\ntensor as one of its components. This expression for the lowest component is an\nenergy-dependent linear combination of two chiral currents, which itself does\nnot correspond to a classically conserved chiral current. The lowest component\nof the other supercurrent, namely, the R-current, satisfies the Adler-Bardeen\ntheorem. The lowest component of the first supercurrent has an anomaly that we\nshow is consistent with the anomaly of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor.\nTherefore, we conclude that there is no consistent way to put the R-current and\nthe stress tensor in a single supercurrent in the quantized theory. We also\ndiscuss and try to clarify some technical points in the derivations of the\ntwo-supercurrents in the literature.

Due to the high singularity in the dipolar interaction\npotential, it brings significant difficulties in mathematical analysis and\nnumerical simulations of dipolar BECs. In this paper, by decoupling the\ntwo-body dipolar interaction potential into short-range (or local) and\nlong-range interactions (or repulsive and attractive interactions), the GPE for\ndipolar BECs is reformulated as a Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson type system. Based\non this new mathematical formulation, we prove rigorously existence and\nuniqueness as well as nonexistence of the ground states, and discuss the\nexistence of global weak solution and finite time blowup of the dynamics in\ndifferent parameter regimes of dipolar BECs. In addition, a backward Euler sine\npseudospectral method is presented for computing the ground states and a\ntime-splitting sine pseudospectral method is proposed for computing the\ndynamics of dipolar BECs. Due to the adaption of new mathematical formulation,\nour new numerical methods avoid evaluating integrals with high singularity and\nthus they are more efficient and accurate than those numerical methods\ncurrently used in the literatures for solving the problem.\n  Extensive numerical examples in 3D are reported to demonstrate the efficiency\nand accuracy of our new numerical methods for computing the ground states and\ndynamics of dipolar BECs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 06:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

Recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm,\nnamely `reactive tabu search' (RTS) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based\n`belief propagation' (BP) algorithm for low-complexity large-MIMO detection.\nThe motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations\non the above two algorithms: $i)$ RTS works for general M-QAM. Although RTS was\nshown to achieve close to optimal performance for 4-QAM in large dimensions,\nsignificant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order QAM\n(e.g., 16- and 64-QAM). ii) BP also was shown to achieve near-optimal\nperformance for large dimensions, but only for $\\{\\pm 1\\}$ alphabet. In this\npaper, we improve the large-MIMO detection performance of higher-order QAM\nsignals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs RTS and BP. In particular,\nmotivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the RTS\noutput, the least significant bits (LSB) of the symbols are mostly in error, we\npropose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than\nLSBs at the RTS output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to\nthe BP algorithm to improve the reliability of the LSBs. The output of the BP\nis then fed back to RTS for the next iteration. Our simulation results show\nthat in a 32 x 32 V-BLAST system, the proposed RTS-BP algorithm performs better\nthan RTS by about 3.5 dB at $10^{-3}$ uncoded BER and by about 2.5 dB at\n$3\\times 10^{-4}$ rate-3/4 turbo coded BER with 64-QAM at the same order of\ncomplexity as RTS.

The\nLOFAR Survey Key Science Project aims at conducting large-sky surveys at 15,\n30, 60, 120 and 200 MHz taking advantage of the wide instantaneous field of\nview and of the unprecedented sensitivity of this instrument. Four topics have\nbeen identified as drivers for these surveys covering the formation of massive\ngalaxies, clusters and black holes using z>6 radio galaxies as probes, the\nstudy of the intercluster magnetic fields using diffuse radio emission and\nFaraday rotation measures in galaxy clusters as probes and the study of star\nformation processes in the early Universe using starburst galaxies as probes.\nThe fourth topic is the exploration of new parameter space for serendipitous\ndiscovery taking advantage of the new observational spectral window open up by\nLOFAR. Here, we briefly discuss the requirements of the proposed surveys to\naddress these (and many others!) topics as well as the synergy with other wide\narea surveys planned at higher frequencies (and in particular in the 1-2 GHz\nband) with new radio facilities like ASKAP and Apertif.

Clear evidence\nfor AGN-induced outflows have been found for the majority of these young radio\nsources.

Two types of low\ndensity polyethylenes (LDPE's) have been investigated: Lupolen 1840 D and LPDE\n1840 H.

Contrary to classical, optically-selected quasars, the X-ray\nproperties of red (i.e. with J-Ks> 1.7 and R-Ks> 4) broad line quasars are\nstill quite unexplored, although there is a growing consensus that, due to\nmoderate obscuration, these objects can offer a unique view of spectral\ncomponents typically swamped by the AGN light in normal, blue quasars. The\nXMM-Newton observation discussed here has definitely confirmed the complexity\nof the X-ray spectrum revealing the presence of a cold (or mildly-ionized)\nabsorber with Nh ~10^{22} cm^-2 along the line of sight to the nucleus and a\nCompton reflection component accompanied by an intense Fe K emission line in\nthis quasar with a Lum(2-10) ~5 x 10^{44} erg/s. A soft-excess component is\nalso required by the data. The match between the column density derived by our\nspectral analysis and that expected on the basis of reddening due to the dust\nsuggests the possibility that both absorptions occur in the same medium. FTM\n0830+3759 is characterized by an extinction/absorption-corrected\nX-ray-to-optical flux ratio alphaox = -2.3, that is steeper than expected on\nthe basis of its UV luminosity. These findings indicate that the X-ray\nproperties of FTM 0830+3759 differs from those typically observed for\noptically-selected broad line quasars with comparable hard X-ray luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 10:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT,\nwe propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all\nUT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in\na distributed manner. For a small number of UTs ($K\\leq M$), the ZF beamforming\ncreates $K$ parallel MISO channels.

With a large number of UTs ($K \\geq M$),\nwe propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select\na subset of $\\Ks$ UTs with limited backhaul communication.

The\ntransfer is effected by the galactic fountain -- cool clouds that are shot up\nfrom the plane to kiloparsec heights above the plane. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds. In external galaxies trails of HI behind individual\nclouds will not be detectable, although the integrated emission from all such\ntrails should be significant. Parts of the trails of the clouds that make up\nthe Galaxy's fountain should be observable and may account for features in\ntargeted 21-cm observations of individual high-velocity clouds and surveys of\nGalactic HI emission. Taken in conjunction with the known decline in the\navailability of cold infall with increasing cosmic time and halo mass, the\nproposed mechanism offers a promising explanation of the division of galaxies\nbetween the blue cloud to the red sequence in the colour-luminosity plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 12:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Or, dually speaking, is\nMaximum-Likelihood decoding almost surely impossible?\n  We relate this issue to the decoding threshold of a code, and show that when\nthe minimal distance of the code is high enough, the threshold effect is very\nsharp. In a second part, we explicit lower-bounds on the threshold of\nMaximum-Distance Separable codes such as Reed-Solomon codes, and compute the\nthreshold for the toy example that motivates this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 13:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-15"}

Here, we review recent theoretical\nresults on the spectrum of Andreev bound states near interfaces and surfaces in\nnon-centrosymmetric superconductors. We introduce a theoretical scheme to\ncalculate the energy spectrum of a non-centrosymmetric superconductor. Then, we\ndiscuss the interplay between the spin orbit vector field on the Fermi surface\nand the order parameter symmetry. The Andreev states carry a spin supercurrent\nand represent a helical edge mode along the interface. We study the topological\nnature of the resulting edge currents. If the triplet component of the order\nparameter dominates, then the helical edge mode exists. If, on the other hand,\nthe singlet component dominates, the helical edge mode is absent. A quantum\nphase transition occurs for equal spin singlet and triplet order parameter\ncomponents. We discuss the tunneling conductance and the Andreev point contact\nconductance between a normal metal and a non-centrosymmetric superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 15:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

We aim at revealing the sub-AU disk structure around the 10 Myr old\nHerbig Be star HD100546 and at investigating the origin of its near and\nmid-infrared excess. We used AMBER/VLTI observations to resolve the K-band\nemission and to constrain the location and composition of the hot dust in the\ninnermost disk. Combining AMBER observations with photometric and MIDI/VLTI\nmeasurements from the litterature, we revisit the disk geometry using a passive\ndisk model based on 3D radiative transfer. We propose a model that includes a\ntenuous inner disk made of micron-sized dust grains, a gap, and a massive\noptically thick outer disk, that successfully reproduces the interferometric\ndata and the SED. We locate the bulk of the K-band emission at ~0.26 AU.\nAssuming that this emission originates from silicate, we show that micron-sized\ngrains are required to enable the dust to survive at such a distance from the\nstar. As a consequence, more than 40% of the K-band flux is related to\nscattering, showing that direct thermal emission is not sufficient to explain\nthe near-infrared excess. In the massive outer disk, large grains in the\nmid-plane are responsible for the mm emission while a surface layer of small\ngrains allows the mid and far infrared excesses to be reproduced. Such vertical\nstructure may be an evidence for sedimentation. The observations are consistent\nwith a model that includes a gap until ~13 AU and a total dust mass of ~0.008\nlunar mass inside it. These values together with the derived scale height (~2.5\nAU) and temperature (~220 K) at the inner edge of the outer disk (r=13 AU), are\nconsistent with recent CO observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2010 15:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
