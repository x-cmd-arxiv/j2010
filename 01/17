Antineutrinos emitted from reactors are used as a\nprobe. As the antineutrinos traverse through a region prone to earthquakes,\nobservable variations in the matter effect on the antineutrino oscillation\nwould provide a tomography of the vicinity of the region. In this preliminary\nwork, we adopt a simplified model for the geometrical profile and matter\ndensity in a fault zone. We calculate the survival probability of electron\nantineutrinos for cases without and with an anomalous accumulation of electrons\nwhich can be considered as a clear signal of the coming earthquake, at the\ngeological region with a fault zone, and find that the variation may reach as\nmuch as 3% for $\\bar \\nu_e$ emitted from a reactor. The case for a $\\nu_e$ beam\nfrom a neutrino factory is also investigated, and it is noted that, because of\nthe typically high energy associated with such neutrinos, the oscillation\nlength is too large and the resultant variation is not practically observable.\nOur conclusion is that with the present reactor facilities and detection\ntechniques, it is still a difficult task to make an earthquake forecast using\nsuch a scheme, though it seems to be possible from a theoretical point of view\nwhile ignoring some uncertainties. However, with the development of the\ngeology, especially the knowledge about the fault zone, and with the\nimprovement of the detection techniques, etc., there is hope that a medium-term\nearthquake forecast would be feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2010 02:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 09:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

There is a significant gap between the best known upper and\nlower bounds for this problem. It is NP-hard, and does not have a PTAS unless\nNP has subexponential time algorithms. On the other hand, the current best\nknown algorithm of Feige, Kortsarz and Peleg, gives an approximation ratio of\nn^(1/3-epsilon) for some specific epsilon > 0 (estimated at around 1/60).\n  We present an algorithm that for every epsilon > 0 approximates the Densest\nk-Subgraph problem within a ratio of n^(1/4+epsilon) in time n^O(1/epsilon). In\nparticular, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of O(n^1/4) in time\nn^O(log n). Our algorithm is inspired by studying an average-case version of\nthe problem where the goal is to distinguish random graphs from graphs with\nplanted dense subgraphs. The approximation ratio we achieve for the general\ncase matches the distinguishing ratio we obtain for this planted problem.\n  At a high level, our algorithms involve cleverly counting appropriately\ndefined trees of constant size in G, and using these counts to identify the\nvertices of the dense subgraph. Our algorithm is based on the following\nprinciple. We say that a graph G(V,E) has log-density alpha if its average\ndegree is Theta(|V|^alpha). The algorithmic core of our result is a family of\nalgorithms that output k-subgraphs of nontrivial density whenever the\nlog-density of the densest k-subgraph is larger than the log-density of the\nhost graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2010 13:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-19"}
