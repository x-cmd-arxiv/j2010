In Part I we\nanalyze certain hyperbolic structures arising when studying gravity in the\nvicinity of a spacelike singularity (the \"BKL-limit\"). In this limit, spatial\npoints decouple and the dynamics exhibits ultralocal behaviour which may be\ndescribed in terms of a (possibly chaotic) hyperbolic billiard. In all\nsupergravities arising as low-energy limits of string theory or M-theory, the\nbilliard dynamics takes place within the fundamental Weyl chambers of certain\nhyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, suggesting that these algebras generate hidden\ninfinite-dimensional symmetries of the theory. Part II of the thesis is devoted\nto a study of how (U-)dualities in string theory provide powerful constraints\non perturbative and non-perturbative quantum corrections. These dualities are\ndescribed by certain arithmetic groups G(Z) which are conjectured to be\npreserved in the effective action.

Joseph invented multidegrees in [Jo84] to study orbital varieties, which\nare the components of an orbital scheme, itself constructed by intersecting a\nnilpotent orbit with a Borel subalgebra. Their multidegrees, known as Joseph\npolynomials, give a basis of a (Springer) representation of the Weyl group. In\nthe case of the nilpotent orbit $\\{ M^2=0 \\}$, the orbital varieties can be\nindexed by noncrossing chord diagrams in the disc.

The multidegrees of its components, the\nBrauer loop varieties, were shown to reproduce the ground state of the Brauer\nloop model in statistical mechanics [DFZJ06]. Here, we reformulate and slightly\ngeneralize these multidegrees in order to express them as solutions of the\nrational quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation associated to the Brauer\nalgebra. In particular, the vector of the multidegrees satisfies two sets of\nequations, corresponding to the $e_i$ and $f_i$ generators of the Brauer\nalgebra. We describe here the geometric meaning of both $e_i$ and $f_i$\nequations in our slightly extended setting.

PEMS executes Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) algorithms in an\nExternal Memory (EM) context, enabling computation with very large data sets\nwhich exceed the size of main memory. Many parallel algorithms have been\ndesigned and implemented for Bulk-Synchronous Parallel models of computation.\nSuch algorithms generally assume that the entire data set is stored in main\nmemory at once. PEMS overcomes this limitation without requiring any\nmodification to the algorithm by using disk space as memory for additional\n\"virtual processors\". Previous work has shown this to be a promising approach\nwhich scales well as computational resources (i.e. processors and disks) are\nadded. However, the technique incurs significant overhead when compared with\npurpose-built EM algorithms.

At the asymmetric\nco-existence level, the secondary network selectively deactivates its users\nbased on knowledge of the interference and channel gains, whereas at the\nsymmetric level, the primary network also schedules its users in the same way.\nOur aim is to derive optimal sum-rates (i.e., throughputs)of both networks at\neach co-existence level as the number of users grows asymptotically and\nevaluate how the sum-rates scale with network size. In order to find the\nasymptotic throughput results, we derive a key lemma on extreme order\nstatistics and a proposition on the sum of lower order statistics. As a\nbaseline comparison, we calculate the sum-rates for channel sharing via\ntime-division (TD). We compare the asymptotic secondary sum-rate in TD with\nthat under simultaneous transmission, while ensuring the primary network\nmaintains the same throughput in both cases. The results indicate that\nsimultaneous transmission at both asymmetric and symmetric co-existence levels\ncan outperform TD. Furthermore, this enhancement is achievable when uplink\nactivation or deactivation of users is based only on the interference gains to\nthe opposite network and not on a network's own channel gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 17:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We\nexploit the higher signal-to-noise, spatial and temporal resolution of the EUVI\ntelescopes over that of SOHO/EIT to study the temporal variation of polar\nplumes in high detail.

In almost\nall polar plumes observed at the limb in these STEREO sequences, in all coronal\npassbands, we observe high speed jets of plasma traveling along the structures\nwith a mean velocity of 135km/s at a range of temperatures from 0.5-1.5MK. The\njets have an apparent brightness enhancement of ~5% above that of the plumes\nthey travel on and repeat quasi-periodically, with repeat-times ranging from\nfive to twenty-five minutes.

The observed jets are remarkably similar in intensity enhancement,\nperiodicity and velocity to those observed in other magnetic regions of the\nsolar atmosphere. They are multi-thermal in nature. We infer that the jets\nobserved on the plumes are a source of heated mass to the fast solar wind.\nFurther, based on the previous results that motivated this study, we suggest\nthat these jets originated in the upper chromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 18:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}

The goal of the system is to achieve\nzero-error communication that is information-theoretically secure from the\nadversary. Moreover, this goal must be attained in a universal fashion, i.e.,\nregardless of the network topology or the underlying network code. An upper\nbound on the achievable rate under these requirements is shown to be n-\\mu-2t\npackets per transmission. A scheme is proposed that can achieve this maximum\nrate, for any n and any field size q, provided the packet length m is at least\nn symbols.

Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass\nplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden\njumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of\nscattered low-mass planets in the disk. We present distributions of the final\neccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass and\ninitial system architecture.

In this work, we present the first direct measurement\nof the IGM temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the Doppler widths of\nLya absorption lines in the proximity zone of SDSS J0818+1722.

We find that when the gas,\ninitially comprising 60% of the mass, is removed, the system settles into a\nbound cluster containing 30-40% of the stellar mass surrounding by an expanding\nhalo of ejected stars. The bound cluster expands from an initial radius of\n<0.05 pc to 1-2 pc over 4-10 Myr, depending on how quickly the gas is removed,\nimplying that stellar clusters may begin with far higher stellar densities than\nusually assumed. With rapid gas dispersal the most massive stars are found to\nbe mass segregated for the first ~1 Myr of evolution, but classical mass\nsegregation only develops for cases with long gas removal timescales.\nEventually, many of the most massive stars are expelled from the bound cluster.\nDespite the high initial stellar density and the extensive dynamical evolution\nof the system, we find that the stellar multiplicity is almost constant during\nthe 10 Myr of evolution. This is because the primordial multiple systems are\nformed in a clustered environment and, thus, by their nature are already\nresistant to further evolution. The majority of multiple system evolution is\nconfined to the decay of high-order systems and the formation of a significant\npopulation of very wide (10^4-10^5 AU) multiple systems in the expanding halo.\nThis formation mechanism for wide binaries potentially solves the problem of\nhow most stars apparently form in clusters and yet a substantial population of\nwide binaries exist in the field. Many of these wide binaries and the binaries\nproduced by the decay of high-order multiple systems have unequal mass\ncomponents, potentially solving the problem that hydrodynamical simulations of\nstar formation are found to under-produce unequal-mass solar-type binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 21:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

From a set of 391 light curves\nk-corrected to the rest frame B and V bands, we find a smaller dispersion in\nthe rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. This is in\nqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in\nradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the\ndecline rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest\nthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properly\nmodel the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset of 105 light\ncurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and\ndevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times\nindependently. We find the average time from explosion to B-band peak\nbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. Our average rise time is shorter than the\n19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different light\ncurve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. We find\nthat slow declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that the\ndistribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single-peaked. This\ndistribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was first\nsuggested by Strovink (2007) from an analysis of a small set of local SNe Ia.\nWe divide the SDSS-II sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, tr-tf\n<= 2 days and tr-tf>2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxy\nproperties and Hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxy\nproperties or Hubble residuals in our sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2010 22:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 18:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-18"}

Here, we draw on a large suite of\nhigh resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to systematically\ninvestigate this process and its dependence on the baryonic physics associated\nwith galaxy formation. The inclusion of baryons results in significantly more\nconcentrated density profiles if radiative cooling is efficient and feedback is\nweak. The dark matter halo concentration can in that case increase by as much\nas 30 (10) per cent on galaxy (cluster) scales. The most significant effects\noccur in galaxies at high redshift, where there is a strong anti-correlation\nbetween the baryon fraction in the halo centre and the inner slope of both the\ntotal and the dark matter density profiles. If feedback is weak, isothermal\ninner profiles form, in agreement with observations of massive, early-type\ngalaxies. However, we find that AGN feedback, or extremely efficient feedback\nfrom massive stars, is necessary to match observed stellar fractions in groups\nand clusters, as well as to keep the maximum circular velocity similar to the\nvirial velocity as observed for disk galaxies. These strong feedback models\nreduce the baryon fraction in galaxies by a factor of 3 relative to the case\nwith no feedback. The AGN is even capable of reducing the baryon fraction by a\nfactor of 2 in the inner region of group and cluster haloes. This in turn\nresults in inner density profiles which are typically shallower than isothermal\nand the halo concentrations tend to be lower than in the absence of baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 02:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2010 04:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-01"}

There are\nnumerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels.\nRecently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for\nDPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that\ndefines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for\nchannel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent\nliterature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching\nshaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder\nworks on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires\niterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high\ncomplexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC\nscheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at\nboth the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit\nshaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The\ncrucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of\nthe bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at\nthe receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the\nshaping and channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the\nproposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an\napplication of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition\ncoding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 07:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-21"}

The method\nhas the further advantage to make a wide frequency range accessible at high\npeak-power and high repetition-rate. An important feature of the proposed\nscheme is that the hardware requirement is minimal. Our technique is based in\nessence on the \"fresh\" bunch technique.

It determines the observational\nappearance of accretion flows, and is also related with the evolution of black\nhole mass and spin. Previous two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of hot\naccretion flows find that the flow is convectively unstable because of its\ninward increase of entropy. As a result, the mass accretion rate decreases\ninward, i.e., only a small fraction of accretion gas can fall onto the black\nhole, while the rest circulates in the convective eddies or lost in convective\noutflows. Radiation is usually neglected in these simulations. In many cases,\nhowever, radiative cooling is important. In the regime of the luminous hot\naccretion flow (LHAF), radiative cooling is even stronger than the viscous\ndissipation. In the one dimensional case, this implies that the inward increase\nof entropy will become slower or the entropy even decreases inward in the case\nof an LHAF. We therefore expect that convective instability becomes weaker or\ncompletely disappears when radiative cooling is important. To examine the\nvalidity of this expectation, in this paper we perform two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of hot accretion flows with strong radiative\ncooling. We find that compared to the case of negligible radiation, convection\nonly becomes slightly weaker. Even an LHAF is still strongly convectively\nunstable, its radial profile of accretion rate correspondingly changes little.\nWe find the reason is that the entropy still increases inward in the\ntwo-dimensional case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 12:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2010 02:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

In this work, we provide the theoretical tools for the search\nfor single molecule magnets suitable for electric control. By group-theoretical\nsymmetry analysis we find that the spin-electric coupling in triangular\nmolecules is governed by the modification of the exchange interaction, and is\npossible even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In pentagonal molecules\nthe spin-electric coupling can exist only in the presence of spin-orbit\ninteraction.

Logically, the\nprimary and secondary calibration points must be mutually consistent, in the\nsense that it must be possible to predict each time point from the other.\nHowever, the attempt by Shaul and Graur (2002, Gene 300: 59-61) to assess the\nreliability of secondary timepoints is flawed because they presented time\nestimates without presenting confidence intervals on those estimates, and so it\nwas not possible to make any explicit hypothesis tests of divergence times.\nAlso, they inappropriately excluded some of the data, which leads to a very\nbiased estimate of one of the divergence times. Here, I present a re-analysis\nof the same data set, with more appropriate methodology, and come to the\nconclusion that no inconsistencies are involved.

We analyze the effects\nof the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interaction by considering the\nmagnetization axis to be perpendicular to the trap symmetry axis. In the\nabsence of a central repulsive barrier, when the trap is purely harmonic, the\neffect of reducing the scattering length is a tuning of the geometry of the\nsystem: from a pancake-shaped condensate when it is large, to a cigar-shaped\ncondensate for small scattering lengths. For a condensate in a toroidal trap,\nthe interaction in combination with the central repulsive Gaussian barrier\nproduces an azimuthal dependence of the particle density for a fixed radial\ndistance. We find that along the magnetization direction the density decreases\nas the scattering length is reduced but presents two symmetric density peaks in\nthe perpendicular axis. For even lower values of the scattering length we\nobserve that the system undergoes a dipolar-induced symmetry breaking\nphenomenon. The whole density becomes concentrated in one of the peaks,\nresembling an origin-displaced cigar-shaped condensate. In this context we also\nanalyze stationary vortex states and their associated velocity field, finding\nthat this latter also shows a strong azimuthal dependence for small scattering\nlengths.

A feature implements a stakeholder's requirement, represents a\ndesign decision and configuration option and, when added to a program, involves\nthe introduction of new structures, such as classes and methods, and the\nrefinement of existing ones, such as extending methods. With feature-oriented\ndecomposition, programs can be generated, solely on the basis of a user's\nselection of features, by the composition of the corresponding feature code. A\nkey challenge of feature-oriented product line engineering is how to guarantee\nthe correctness of an entire feature-oriented product line, i.e., of all of the\nmember programs generated from different combinations of features. As the\nnumber of valid feature combinations grows progressively with the number of\nfeatures, it is not feasible to check all individual programs. The only\nfeasible approach is to have a type system check the entire code base of the\nfeature-oriented product line. We have developed such a type system on the\nbasis of a formal model of a feature-oriented Java-like language.

The\nextracted values increase from 5 to ~16 as A increases from 9 to 37. These\nvalues have been compared to the results of calculations using the\nAntisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD) model together with the statistical\ndecay code Gemini. The calculated ratios are in good agreement with those\nextracted from the experiment. In contrast, the ratios determined from fitting\nthe primary fragment distributions from the AMD model calculation are ~ 4 and\nshow little variation with A. This observation indicates that the value of the\nsymmetry energy coefficient derived from final fragment observables may be\nsignificantly different than the actual value at the time of fragment\nformation. The experimentally observed pairing effect is also studied within\nthe same simulations. The Coulomb coefficient is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 15:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2010 18:33:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2010 16:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

These are subsequently\ncompared with both long wavelength channel Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) spectra from the Hinode satellite (covering 245-291 A), and\nfirst-order observations (235-449 A) obtained by the Solar Extreme-ultraviolet\nResearch Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS). The 266.39, 266.60 and 276.36 A\nlines of Fe XI are detected in two EIS spectra, confirming earlier\nidentifications of these features, and 276.36 A is found to provide an electron\ndensity diagnostic when ratioed against the 257.55 A transition. Agreement\nbetween theory and observation is found to be generally good for the SERTS data\nsets, with discrepancies normally being due to known line blends, while the\n257.55 A feature is detected for the first time in SERTS spectra. The most\nuseful Fe XI electron density diagnostic is found to be the 308.54/352.67\nintensity ratio, which varies by a factor of 8.4 between N_e = 10^8 and 10^11\ncm^-3, while showing little temperature sensitivity. However, the 349.04/352.67\nratio potentially provides a superior diagnostic, as it involves lines which\nare closer in wavelength, and varies by a factor of 14.7 between N_e = 10^8 and\n10^11 cm^-3. Unfortunately, the 349.04 A line is relatively weak, and also\nblended with the second-order Fe X 174.52 A feature, unless the first-order\ninstrument response is enhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2010 15:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
