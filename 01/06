In these auctions, bidders incur a\ncost for placing each bid in addition to (or sometimes in lieu of) the winner's\nfinal purchase cost. Thus even when a winner's purchase cost is a small\nfraction of the item's intrinsic value, the auctioneer can still profit\nhandsomely from the bid fees. Our work provides novel analyses for these\nauctions, based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at\nSwoopo.com, the leading pay-per-bid auction site. While previous modeling work\npredicts profit-free equilibria, we analyze the impact of information asymmetry\nbroadly, as well as Swoopo features such as bidpacks and the Swoop It Now\noption specifically, to quantify the effects of imperfect information in these\nauctions. We find that even small asymmetries across players (cheaper bids,\nbetter estimates of other players' intent, different valuations of items,\ncommitted players willing to play \"chicken\") can increase the auction duration\nwell beyond that predicted by previous work and thus skew the auctioneer's\nprofit disproportionately. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of a\ndataset of thousands of live auctions we observed on Swoopo, which enables us\nalso to examine behavioral factors, such as the power of aggressive bidding.\nUltimately, our findings show that even with fully rational players, if players\noverlook or are unaware any of these factors, the result is outsized profits\nfor pay-per-bid auctioneers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2010 16:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2010 21:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Two experimental tests of the model show that many workers\nrespond rationally to offered incentives. However, a non-trivial fraction of\nsubjects appear to set earnings targets. These \"target earners\" consider not\njust the offered wage--which is what the rational model predicts--but also\ntheir proximity to earnings goals.

We demonstrate this approach by examining the recent\nclaim of 0912.0552 regarding the possible DM origin of the 2.5 keV line in\nChandra observations of the Milky Way satellite known as Willman 1. Our\nconservative strategy is to adopt a relatively large dark mass for Willman 1\nand relatively small dark masses for the comparison objects. We analyze\narchival observations by XMM-Newton of M31 and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy\n(dSph) and Chandra observations of Sculptor dSph. By performing a conservative\nanalysis of X-ray spectra, we show the absence of a DM decay line with\nparameters consistent with those of 0912.0552. For M31, the observations of the\nregions between 10 and 20 kpc from the center, where the uncertainties in the\nDM distribution are minimal, make a strong exclusion at the level above\n10sigma. The minimal estimate for the amount of DM in the central 40 kpc of M31\nis provided by the model of 0912.4133, assuming the stellar disk's mass to\nlight ratio ~8 and almost constant DM density within a core of 28 kpc. Even in\nthis case one gets an exclusion at 5.7sigma from central region of M31 whereas\nmodeling all processed data from M31 and Fornax produces more than 14sigma\nexclusion. Therefore, despite possible systematic uncertainties, we exclude the\npossibility that the spectral feature at ~2.5 keV found in 0912.0552 is a DM\ndecay line. We conclude, however, that the search for DM decay line, although\ndemanding prolonged observations of well-studied dSphs, M31 outskirts and other\nsimilar objects, is rather promising, as the nature of a possible signal can be\nchecked. An (expected) non-observation of a DM decay signal in the planned\nobservations of Willman 1 should not discourage further dedicated observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2010 20:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2010 17:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}

While extended emission is detected in the majority of the sources, about\n7% of the sources exhibit only radio core emission. Many BL Lacs exhibit\nextended radio power and kpc-scale morphology typical of powerful FRII jets,\nwhile a substantial number of quasars possess radio powers intermediate between\nFRIs and FRIIs. This poses challenges to the simple radio-loud unified scheme,\nwhich links BL Lacs to FRIs and quasars to FRIIs. We find a significant\ncorrelation between extended radio emission and pc-scale jet speeds: the more\nradio powerful sources possess faster jets. This indicates that the 1.4 GHz (or\nlow frequency) radio emission is indeed related to jet kinetic power. Various\nproperties such as extended radio power and apparent pc-scale jet speeds vary\nsmoothly between different blazar subclasses, suggesting that, at least in\nterms of radio jet properties, the distinction between quasars and BL Lac\nobjects, at an emission-line equivalent width of 5 Angstrom is essentially an\narbitrary one. Based on the assumption that the extended radio luminosity is\naffected by the kpc-scale environment, we define the ratio of extended radio\npower to absolute optical magnitude as a proxy for environmental effects.\nTrends with this parameter suggest that the pc-scale jet speeds and the\npc-to-kpc jet misalignments are not affected by the large-scale environment,\nbut are more likely to depend upon factors intrinsic to the AGN, or its local\npc-scale environment. We suggest that some of the extremely misaligned MOJAVE\nblazar jets could be \"hybrid\" morphology sources, with an FRI jet on one side\nand an FRII jet on the other.

The goal of the paper is two-fold.\nFirst, we analyze the dependence of W on the upper cut-off w_c placed on the\noptical integral because in experiments W is measured up to frequencies of\norder bandwidth. For a BCS model, the Kubo sum rule is almost fully reproduced\nat w_c equal to the bandwidth. But for other models only 70%-80% of Kubo sum\nrule is obtained up to this scale and even less so for \\Delta W, implying that\nthe Kubo sum rule has to be applied with caution. Second, we analyze the sign\nof \\Delta W. In all models we studied \\Delta W is positive at small w_c, then\ncrosses zero and approaches a negative value at large w_c, i.e. the optical\nintegral in a superconductor is smaller than in a normal state.

A variety of evidence\nindicates that gas-rich major mergers play an important role in the formation\nof elliptical galaxies. We simulate 1:1 disk mergers at seven different initial\ngas fractions ranging from 0 to 40%, using the TreeSPH code Gadget-2. We\nclassify the stellar orbits in each remnant and construct radial profiles of\nthe orbital content, intrinsic shape, and orientation. The dissipationless\nremnants are typically prolate-triaxial, dominated by box orbits within r_c ~\n1.5Reff, and by tube orbits in their outer parts. As the gas fraction\nincreases, the box orbits within r_c are increasingly replaced by a population\nof short axis tubes (z-tubes) with near zero net rotation, and the remnants\nbecome progressively more oblate and round. The long axis tube (x-tube) orbits\nare highly streaming and relatively insensitive to the gas fraction, implying\nthat their angular momentum is retained from the dynamically cold initial\nconditions. Outside r_c, the orbital structure is essentially unchanged by the\ngas. The 15-20% gas remnants often display disk-like kinematically distinct\ncores (KDCs). These remnants show an interesting resemblance, in both their\nvelocity maps and intrinsic orbital structure, to the KDC galaxy NGC4365 (van\nden Bosch et al. 2008). At 30-40% gas, the remnants are rapidly rotating, with\nsharp embedded disks on ~ 1Reff scales.

We find that the star-forming\nregions within the GMCs are invariably formed by gravitational contraction.\nAfter an initial period of contraction, the collapsing clouds begin forming\nstars, whose feedback evaporates part of the clouds' mass, opposing the\ncontinuing accretion from the infalling gas. The competition of accretion\nagainst dense gas consumption by star formation (SF) and evaporation by the\nfeedback, regulates the clouds' mass and energy balance, as well as their SFE.\nWe find that, in the presence of feedback, the clouds attain levels of the SFE\nthat are consistent at all times with observational determinations for regions\nof comparable SF rates (SFRs). However, we observe that the dense gas mass is\nlarger in general in the presence of feedback, while the total (dense gas +\nstars) is nearly insensitive to the presence of feedback, suggesting that the\ntotal mass is determined by the accretion, while the feedback inhibits mainly\nthe conversion of dense gas to stars. The factor by which the SFE is reduced\nupon the inclusion of feedback is a decreasing function of the cloud's mass,\nfor clouds of size ~ 10 pc. This naturally explains the larger observed SFEs of\nmassive-star forming regions. We also find that the clouds may attain a\npseudo-virialized state, with a value of the virial mass very similar to the\nactual cloud mass. However, this state differs from true virialization in that\nthe clouds are the center of a large-scale collapse, continuously accreting\nmass, rather than being equilibrium entities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 02:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Heterogeneous SWCNT networks\ndip-coated onto sub-micron wide ultra-thin polymer channels exhibit a topology\nthat becomes increasingly aligned with decreasing channel width and thickness.\nExperimental scale coarse-grained computations of interacting SWCNTs show that\nthe effect is a reflection of an aligned topology that is no longer dependent\non the network density, which in turn emerges as a robust knob that can induce\nsemiconductor-to-metallic transitions in the network response.

Furthermore,\nwe shall deal with this problem in the realm of cosmological spacetimes by\nanalyzing the Einstein equations in a semiclassical fashion. More precisely, we\nshall show that, at least on small intervals of time, solutions for this\ninteracting system exist. This result will be achieved providing an iteration\nscheme and showing that the series, obtained starting from the massless\nsolution, converges in the appropriate Banach space. The quantum states with\ngood ultraviolet behavior (Hadamard property), used in order to obtain the\nbackreaction, will be completely determined by their form on the initial\nsurface if chosen to be lightlike. Furthermore, on small intervals of time,\nthey do not influence the behavior of the exact solution. On large intervals of\ntime the situation is more complicated but, if the spacetime is expanding, we\nshall show that the end-point of the evolution does not depend strongly on the\nquantum state, because, in this limit, the expectation values of the matter\nfields responsible for the backreaction do not depend on the particular\nhomogeneous Hadamard state at all. Finally, we shall comment on the\ninterpretation of the semiclassical Einstein equations for this kind of\nproblems. Although the fluctuations of the expectation values of pointlike\nfields diverge, if the spacetime and the quantum state have a large spatial\nsymmetry and if we consider the smeared fields on regions of large spatial\nvolume, they tend to vanish.

The Y500-M500 relation, derived for the first time in\nsuch a wide mass range, has a normalisation Y*500=[1.60 pm 0.19] 10^{-3}\narcmin^2 at M500=3 10^{14} h^{1} Msun, in excellent agreement with the X-ray\nprediction of 1.54 10^{-3} arcmin^2, and a mass exponent of alpha=1.79 pm 0.17,\nconsistent with the self-similar expectation of 5/3. Constraints on the\nredshift exponent are weak due to the limited redshift range of the sample,\nalthough they are compatible with self-similar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 11:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 13:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

At first, based on the\nclose relation of foliations and noncommutative C*-algebras we show that cyclic\ncohomology invariants characterize some small exotic R^4. Certain exotic smooth\nR^4's define a generalized embedding into a space which is K-theoretic\nequivalent to a noncommutative Banach algebra. Furthermore, we show that a\nfactor III von Neumann algebra is naturally related with nonstandard smoothing\nof a small R^4 and conjecture that this factor is the unique hyperfinite factor\nIII_1. We also show how an exotic smoothing of a small R^4 is related to the\nDrinfeld-Turaev (deformation) quantization of the Poisson algebra\n(X(S,SL(2,C),{,}) of complex functions on the space of flat connections\nX(S,SL(2,C) over a surface S, and that the result of this quantization is the\nskein algebra (K_t(S),[,]) for the deformation parameter t=exp(h/4).

Thus, the quantization of the\nPoisson algebra of closed circles in a leaf of the codimension 1 foliation of\nS^3 gives rise to the factor III_1 associated with exotic smoothness of R^4.\nFinally, the approach to quantization via exotic 4-smoothness is considered as\na fundamental question in dimension 4 and compared with the topos approach to\nquantum theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 12:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2010 09:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-27"}

The emission flux has been measured by\nCGRO/COMPTEL, BeppoSAX/PDS and INTEGRAL/IBIS.

The line profiles reflect the kinematics of the 44Ti in\nCassiopeia A and can thus place constraints on its nucleosynthesis and\npotentially on the associated explosion process.

Escape can be driven by upward thermal\nconduction of energy deposited well below the exobase, as well as by\nnon-thermal processes produced by energy deposited in the exobase region.\nRecent applications of a model for escape driven by upward thermal conduction,\ncalled the slow hydrodynamic escape model, have resulted in surprisingly large\nloss rates for the thick atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Based on a\nmolecular kinetic simulation of the exobase region, these rates appear to be\norders of magnitude too large. Because of the large amount of Cassini data\nalready available for Titan's upper atmosphere and the wealth of data expected\nwithin the next decade for the atmospheres of Pluto, Mars, and extrasolar\nplanets, accurately determining present escape rates is critical for\nunderstanding their evolution. Therefore, the slow hydrodynamic model is\nevaluated here. It is shown that such a model cannot give a reliable\ndescription of the atmospheric temperature profile unless it is coupled to a\nmolecular kinetic description of the exobase region. Therefore, the present\nescape rates for Titan and Pluto must be re-evaluated using atmospheric models\ndescribed in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 15:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2010 01:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We start from the Cahn-Hilliard model of spinodal\ndecomposition in a binary fluid mixture under flow from which we derive the\ncoarse-grained description. The crucial step in this procedure is to identify\nthe relevant coarse-grained variables and find the appropriate mapping which\nexpresses them in terms of the more microscopic variables. In order to capture\nthe physics of the Doi-Ohta level, we introduce the interfacial width as an\nadditional variable at that level. In this way, we account for the stretching\nof the interface under flow and derive analytically the convective behavior of\nthe relevant coarse-grained variables, which in the long wavelength limit\nrecovers the familiar phenomenological Doi-Ohta model. In addition, we obtain\nthe expression for the interfacial tension in terms of the Cahn-Hilliard\nparameters as a direct result of the developed coarse-graining procedure.\nFinally, by analyzing the numerical results obtained from the simulations on\nthe Cahn-Hilliard level, we discuss that dissipative processes at the Doi-Ohta\nlevel are of the same origin as in the Cahn-Hilliard model. The way to estimate\nthe interface relaxation times of the Doi-Ohta model from the underlying\nmorphology dynamics simulated at the Cahn-Hilliard level is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2010 15:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}
