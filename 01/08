We used data\nfrom both the Chandra ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instruments, and high\nresolution X-ray spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating\nSpectrometer. The Chandra data show that there is a radial stratification of\noxygen, intermediate mass elements and iron, with the emission from more\nmassive elements more toward the center. Using a deprojection technique we\nmeasure a forward shock radius of 4.0(3) pc and a reverse shock radius of\n2.7(4) pc. We took the observed stratification of the shocked ejecta into\naccount in the modeling of the X-ray spectra with multi-component NEI models,\nwith the components corresponding to layers dominated by one or two elements.\nAn additional component was added in order to represent the ISM, which mostly\ncontributed to the continuum emission. This model fits the data well, and was\nalso employed to characterize the spectra of distinct regions extracted from\nthe Chandra data. From our spectral analysis we find that the fractional masses\nof shocked ejecta for the most abundant elements are: M(O)=32%, M(Si/S)=7%/5%,\nM(Ar+Ca)=1%, and M(Fe) = 55%. From the continuum component we derive a\ncircumstellar density of nH= 2.4(2)/cm^3. This density, together with the\nmeasurements of the forward and reverse shock radii suggest an age of 450+/-200\nyr,somewhat lower than, but consistent with the estimate based on the optical\nlight echo (600+/-200 yr). From the RGS spectra we measured a Doppler\nbroadening of sigma=1873+/-50 km/s, from implying a forward shock velocity of\nvS = 2770+/-500 km/s. We discuss the results in the context of single\ndegenerate explosion models, using semi-analytical and numerical modeling, and\ncompare the characteristics of 0519-69.0 with those of other Type Ia supernova\nremnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 18:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2010 09:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 May 2010 09:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-11"}

We also made line images and profiles of\nW51e2 for three hydrogen radio recombination lines (H26\\alpha, H53\\alpha, and\nH66\\alpha) and absorption of two molecular lines of HCN(4-3) and CO(2-1). At\nleast four distinct continuum components have been detected in the 3\" region of\nW51e2 from the SMA continuum images at 0.85 and 1.3 mm with resolutions of\n0.3\"x0.2\" and 1.4\"x0.7\", respectively.

In our modeling, we also take into account the evolution\nof misalignment angle due to accretion of material onto the black hole during\nthe X-ray binary phase.

The GOODS/VIMOS spectroscopic campaign is structured in\ntwo separate surveys using two different VIMOS grisms. The VIMOS Low Resolution\nBlue (LR-Blue) and Medium Resolution (MR) orange grisms have been used to cover\ndifferent redshift ranges. The LR-Blue campaign is aimed at observing galaxies\nmainly at 1.8<z<3.5, while the MR campaign mainly aims at galaxies at z<1 and\nLyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z>3.5. The full GOODS/VIMOS spectroscopic\ncampaign consists of 20 VIMOS masks. This release adds 8 new masks to the\nprevious release (12 masks, Popesso et al. 2009). In total we obtained 5052\nspectra, 3634 from the 10 LR-Blue masks and 1418 from the 10 MR masks. A\nsignificant fraction of the extracted spectra comes from serendipitously\nobserved sources: ~21% in the LR-Blue and ~16% in the MR masks. We obtained\n2242 redshifts in the LR-Blue campaign and 976 in the MR campaign for a total\nsuccess rate of 62% and 69% respectively, which increases to 66% and 73% if\nonly primary targets are considered. The typical redshift uncertainty is\nestimated to be ~0.0012 (~255 km/s) for the LR-Blue grism and ~0.00040 (~120\nkm/s) for the MR grism. By complementing our VIMOS spectroscopic catalog with\nall existing spectroscopic redshifts publicly available in the CDFS, we\ncompiled a redshift master catalog with 7332 entries, which we used to\ninvestigate large scale structures out to z~3.7. We produced stacked spectra of\nLBGs in a few bins of equivalent width (EW) of the Ly-alpha and found evidence\nfor a lack of bright LBGs with high EW of the Ly-alpha. Finally, we obtained\nnew redshifts for 12 X-ray sources of the CDFS and extended-CDFS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 17:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Further asteroseismic constraints can be\nobtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which all\nhave similar age, distance and chemical composition.\n  AIMS: To improve our comprehension of the beta Cep stars, we studied the\nyoung open cluster NGC 884 to discover new B-type pulsators, besides the two\nknown beta Cep stars, and other variable stars.\n  METHODS: An extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate CCD\nphotometry time series in four filters (U, B, V, I) of a field of NGC884.\nFifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 CCD images in 1286 hours.\nThe images were calibrated and reduced to transform the CCD frames into\ninterpretable differential light curves. Various variability indicators and\nfrequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. Absolute\nphotometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties.\n  RESULTS: We achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5.7 mmag in V,\n6.9 mmag in B, 5.0 mmag in I and 5.3 mmag in U. The noise level in the\namplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the V band. Our campaign confirms the\npreviously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- and\nmono-periodic B-, A- and F-type stars. Their interpretation in terms of\nclassical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfections\nin theoretical instability computations. In addition, we have discovered six\nnew eclipsing binaries and four candidates as well as other irregular variable\nstars in the observed field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 17:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The electrochemical and spin-dependent chemical potentials\non the probe are controllable and tuned to values ensuring that neither charge\nnor spin current flow between the system and the probe, on time-average. For\nthe relevant case of a single-channel probe, we find that the resulting\npotentials are exactly independent of the transparency of the contact between\nthe probe and the system. Assuming that spin relaxation processes are absent in\nthe probe, we therefore identify the local spin-dependent potentials in the\nsample at the probe position, and hence the local current-induced spin\npolarization, with the spin-dependent potentials in the probe itself. The\nstatistics of these local chemical potentials is calculated within random\nmatrix theory. While they vanish on spatial and mesoscopic average, they\nexhibit large fluctuations, and we show that single systems typically have spin\npolarizations exceeding all known current-induced spin polarizations by a\nparametrically large factor. Our theory allows to calculate quantum\ncorrelations between spin polarizations inside the sample and spin currents\nflowing out of it. We show that these large polarizations correlate only weakly\nwith spin currents in external leads, and that only a fraction of them can be\nconverted into a spin current in the linear regime of transport, which is\nconsistent with the mesoscopic universality of spin conductance fluctuations.\nWe numerically confirm the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 18:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 19:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

PBM was based on a substructure of a ring of\nlocalized bubbles (gluonic hot spots) which initially contain 3-4 partons\ncomposed of almost entirely gluons. The bubbles emitted correlated particles at\nkinetic freezeout, leading to a lumpy fireball surface. For a selection of\ncharged particles (0.8 GeV/c $<$ $p_t$ $<$ 4.0 GeV/c), the PBM reasonably\nquantitatively (within a few percent) explained high precision RHIC\nexperimental correlation analyses in a manner which was consistent with the\nsmall observed HBT source size in this transverse momentum range. We\ndemonstrated that surface emission from a distributed set of surface sources\n(as in the PBM) was necessary to obtain this consistency. In this paper we give\na review of the above comparison to central Au Au collisions. The bubble\nformation can be associated with gluonic objects predicted by a Glasma Flux\nTube Model (GFTM) that formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane\nof two colliding sheets of Color Glass Condensate (CGC), which pass through one\nanother. These sheets create boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color\nelectric and magnetic fields. A blast wave gives the tubes near the surface\ntransverse flow in the same way it gave transverse flow to the bubbles in the\nPBM. In the GFTM the longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields have a\nnon-zero topological charge density $F \\widetilde F$. These fields cause a\nlocal strong CP violation which effects charged particle production coming from\nquarks and anti-quarks created in the tube or bubble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 18:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-08"}

Steady progress has shown that these CFTs should be\nlogarithmic, with indecomposable operator product expansions, and\nindecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra. In one of the earliest\npapers on the subject, V. Gurarie introduced a single parameter b to quantify\nthis indecomposability in terms of the logarithmic partner t of the stress\nenergy tensor T. He and A. Ludwig conjectured further that b=-5/8 for polymers\nand b=5/6 for percolation. While a lot of physics may be hidden behind this\nparameter - which has also given rise to a lot of discussions - it had remained\nvery elusive up to now, due to the lack of available methods to measure it\nexperimentally or numerically, in contrast say with the central charge. We show\nin this paper how to overcome the many difficulties in trying to measure b.\nThis requires control of a lattice scalar product, lattice Jordan cells,\ntogether with a precise construction of the state L_{-2}|0>. The final result\nis that b=5/6 for polymers. For percolation, we find that b=-5/8 within an XXZ\nor supersymmetric representation. In the geometrical representation, we do not\nfind a Jordan cell for L_0 at level two (finite-size Hamiltonian and transfer\nmatrices are fully diagonalizable), so there is no b in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 20:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Generally, these\nmodels imply inhomogeneous matter distributions alter the observable relations\nthat are taken for granted when assuming the Universe evolves according to the\nstandard Friedmann equations. Moreover, it has recently been shown that both\ninhomogeneous matter and pressure distributions are required in both early and\nlate stages of cosmological evolution. These associated pressure gradients are\nrequired in the early Universe to sufficiently describe void formation, whilst\nlate-stage pressure gradients stop the appearance of anomalous singularities.\nIn this paper we investigate the effect of pressure gradients on cosmological\nobservations by deriving the luminosity distance - redshift relations in\nspherically symmetric, inhomogeneous spacetimes endowed with a perfect fluid.\nBy applying this to a specific example for the energy density distribution and\nusing various equations of state, we are able to explicitly show that pressure\ngradients may have a non-negligble effect on cosmological observations. In\nparticular, we show that a non-zero pressure gradient can imply significantly\ndifferent residual Hubble diagrams for $z\\lesssim1$ compared to when the\npressure is ignored.

A substantial amount of turbulence\nenergy is injected in the ICM due to major merger. Our simulations show that\nthe shock launched after a major merger develops an ellipsoidal shape and gets\nbroken by the interaction with the filamentary cosmic web around the merging\ncluster. The size of the post-shock region along the direction of shock\npropagation is about 300 kpc h^-1, and the turbulent velocity dispersion in\nthis region is larger than 100 km s^-1. Scaling analysis of the turbulence\nenergy with the cluster mass within our cluster sample is consistent with\nM^(5/3), i.e. the scaling law for the thermal energy in the self-similar\ncluster model. This clearly indicates the close relation between virialization\nand injection of turbulence in the cluster evolution. We found that the ratio\nof the turbulent to total pressure in the cluster core within 2 Gyr after the\nmajor merger is larger than 10%, and it takes about 4 Gyr to get relaxed, which\nis substantially longer than typically assumed in the turbulent re-acceleration\nmodels, invoked to explain the statistics of observed radio halos. Striking\nsimilarities in the morphology and other physical parameters between our\nsimulations and the \"symmetrical radio relics\" found at the periphery of the\nmerging cluster A3376 are finally discussed. In particular, the interaction\nbetween the merger shock and the filaments surrounding the cluster could\nexplain the presence of \"notch-like\" features at the edges of the double\nrelics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2010 21:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2010 07:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-14"}

In this work, we attempt to\nquantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key\ncharacteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the\nnumber of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree.\nSpecifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential\ngrowth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. We\nanalytically and empirically find that the number of children has\nasymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on\naverage half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98%\nof infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of\ninfected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the\ngeneration follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length\nof the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with\nthe total number of infected hosts. Next, we empirically study the infection\nstructure of localized-scanning worms and surprisingly find that most of the\nabove observations also apply to localized-scanning worms. Finally, we apply\nour findings to develop bot detection methods and study potential\ncountermeasures for a botnet (e.g., Conficker C) that uses scan-based peer\ndiscovery to form a P2P-based botnet. Specifically, we demonstrate that\ntargeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of\nchildren is an efficient way to expose bots. For example, our simulation shows\nthat when 3.125% nodes are examined, targeted detection can reveal 22.36% bots.\nHowever, we also point out that future botnets may limit the maximum number of\nchildren to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed\nof worm infection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 03:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2010 05:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We find an extended and\nelongated halo of likely members to a radius of nearly 60'. Our measured core\nradius of Rcore = 8.'24+/-0.'60 is somewhat larger than that of previous\nestimates. We attribute the larger core radius measurement to the SDSS probing\nlower mass main sequence stars than has been done before for similar studies of\nM67, and the exclusion of post main sequence M67 members in the SDSS sample. We\nestimate the number of M67 members in our SDSS sample to be 1385+/-67 stars. A\nlower limit on the binary fraction in M67 is measured to be 45%. A higher\nfraction of binary stars is measured in the core as compared to the halo, and\nthe luminosity function of the core is found to be more depleted of low-mass\nstars. Thus the halo is consistent with mass segregation within the cluster.\nThe galactic orbit of M67 is calculated from recent proper motion and radial\nvelocity determinations. The elongated halo is roughly aligned to the proper\nmotion of the cluster. This appears to be a result of mass segregation due to\nthe galactic tidal field. Our algorithm is run on 2MASS photometry to directly\ncompare to previous studies of M67. Decreasing core radii are found for stars\nwith greater masses. We test the accuracy of our algorithm using 1000\nartificial cluster Monte Carlo simulations.

The supramillion-atom nature of these bionanosystems prohibits the\nuse of a direct molecular dynamics approach for phenomena like viral structural\ntransitions or self-assembly that develop over milliseconds or longer. A key\nelement of these multiscale systems is the cross-talk between, and consequent\nstrong coupling of, processes over many scales in space and time. We elucidate\nthe role of interscale cross-talk and overcome bionanosystem simulation\ndifficulties with automated construction of order parameters (OPs) describing\nsupra-nanometer scale structural features, construction of OP dependent\nensembles describing the statistical properties of atomistic variables that\nultimately contribute to the entropies driving the dynamics of the OPs, and the\nderivation of a rigorous equation for the stochastic dynamics of the OPs.

For example, image\ncategorization often relies on uniform voting among the nearest prototypes in\nthe space of descriptors. In spite of its good properties, the classic k-NN\nrule suffers from high variance when dealing with sparse prototype datasets in\nhigh dimensions. A few techniques have been proposed to improve k-NN\nclassification, which rely on either deforming the nearest neighborhood\nrelationship or modifying the input space. In this paper, we propose a novel\nboosting algorithm, called UNN (Universal Nearest Neighbors), which induces\nleveraged k-NN, thus generalizing the classic k-NN rule. We redefine the voting\nrule as a strong classifier that linearly combines predictions from the k\nclosest prototypes. Weak classifiers are learned by UNN so as to minimize a\nsurrogate risk. A major feature of UNN is the ability to learn which prototypes\nare the most relevant for a given class, thus allowing one for effective data\nreduction. Experimental results on the synthetic two-class dataset of Ripley\nshow that such a filtering strategy is able to reject \"noisy\" prototypes.

We first show that when an LLL application provides a\nsmall amount of slack, the running time of the Moser-Tardos algorithm is\npolynomial in the number of underlying independent variables (not events!), and\ncan thus be used to give efficient constructions in cases where the underlying\nproof applies the LLL to super-polynomially many events (or where finding a bad\nevent that holds is computationally hard). We demonstrate our method on\napplications including: the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for\nthe Santa Claus problem, as well as efficient algorithms for acyclic edge\ncoloring, non-repetitive graph colorings, and Ramsey-type graphs. Second, we\nshow applications to cases where a few of the bad events can hold, leading to\nthe first such algorithmic applications of the LLL: MAX $k$-SAT is an\nillustrative example of this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 09:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2010 07:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2010 19:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 May 2010 21:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2011 05:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-04"}

In the case of supermassive\nblack holes at the centres of galaxies this has been known for decades, but for\nstellar-mass black holes residing within galaxies like our own, it has taken\nrecent advances to arrive at this conclusion. Here, a review is given of the\nevidence that supports the existence of jets from accreting stellar-mass black\nholes, from observations made at optical and infrared wavelengths. In\nparticular it is found that on occasion, jets can dominate the emission of\nthese systems at these wavelengths. In addition, the interactions between the\njets and the surrounding matter produce optical and infrared emission on large\nscales via thermal and non-thermal processes. The evidence, implications and\napplications in the context of jet physics are discussed. It is shown that many\nproperties of the jets can be constrained from these studies, including the\ntotal kinetic power they contain. The main conclusion is that like the\nsupermassive black holes, the jet kinetic power of accreting stellar-mass black\nholes is sometimes comparable to their bolometric radiative luminosity. Future\nstudies can test ubiquities in jet properties between objects, and attempt to\nunify the properties of jets from all observable accreting black holes, i.e. of\nall masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-11"}

Nine\noutbursts from both the historical photographic records as well as from recent\nphotometric measurements have been used as fixed points of the solution: 1913,\n1947, 1957, 1973, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2007 outbursts.

These\ncharacteristics or `marks' permit to understand the galaxy catalogs that carry\nall this information as realizations of marked point processes. Many attempts\nhave been presented to quantify the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on\ntheir inner properties. The present paper summarizes methods on spatial marked\nstatistics used in cosmology to disentangle luminosity, colour or morphological\nsegregation and introduces a new one in this context, the mark connection\nfunction. The methods used here are the partial correlation functions,\nincluding the cross-correlation function, the normalised mark correlation\nfunction, the mark variogram and the mark connection function. All these\nmethods are applied to a volume-limited sample drawn from the 2dFGRS, using the\nspectral type as the mark. We show the virtues of each method to provide\ninformation about the clustering properties of each population, the dependence\nof the clustering on the marks, the similarity of the marks as a function of\nthe pair distances, and the way to characterise the spatial correlation between\nthe marks. We demonstrate by means of these statistics that passive galaxies\nexhibit stronger spatial correlation than active galaxies at small scales (r\n<20 Mpc/h). The mark connection function, introduced here, is particularly\nuseful for understanding the spatial correlation between the marks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 14:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

Graham, Arizona, US) is presented. The statistic includes measurements\nrelated to 43 nights done with a Generalized Scidar (GS) used in standard\nconfiguration with a vertical resolution Delta(H)~1 km on the whole 20 km and\nwith the new technique (HVR-GS) in the first kilometer. The latter achieves a\nresolution Delta(H)~20-30 m in this region of the atmosphere. Measurements done\nin different periods of the year permit us to provide a seasonal variation\nanalysis of the Cn2. A discretized distribution of Cn2 useful for the Ground\nLayer Adaptive Optics (GLAO) simulations is provided and a specific analysis\nfor the LBT Laser Guide Star system ARGOS (running in GLAO configuration) case\nis done including the calculation of the 'gray zones' for J, H and K bands. Mt.\nGraham confirms to be an excellent site with median values of the seeing\nwithout dome contribution epsilon = 0.72\", the isoplanatic angle theta0 = 2.5\"\nand the wavefront coherence time tau0= 4.8 msec. We find that the optical\nturbulence vertical distribution decreases in a much sharper way than what has\nbeen believed so far in proximity of the ground above astronomical sites. We\nfind that 50% of the whole turbulence develops in the first 80+/-15 m from the\nground. We finally prove that the error in the normalization of the\nscintillation that has been recently put in evidence in the principle of the GS\ntechnique, affects these measurements with an absolutely negligible quantity\n(0.04\").\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 15:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2010 15:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-29"}

From this\nperspective, the evolutionary perspective in economics can be complemented with\nthe reflexive turn from sociology. The combination provides a richer\nunderstanding of how knowledge-based systems of innovation are shaped and\nreconstructed. The communicative capacities of the carrying agents become\ncrucial to the system's further development, whereas the institutional\narrangements (e.g., national systems) can be expected to remain under\nreconstruction. The tension of the differentiation no longer needs to be\nresolved, since the network configurations are reproduced by means of\ntranslations among historically changing codes. Some methodological and\nepistemological implications for studying innovation systems are explicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 15:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-11"}
