With the equations of motion of the particles, the center-of-mass\nenergy is investigated when the collision takes place at the horizon of a Sen\nblack hole.

However, a\nparticle with the angular momentum $l=l'_{\\text{c}}$ could not approach the\nblack hole from outside of the horizon through free fall, which implies that\nthe collision with arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy could not take place.\nThus, there is an upper bound of the center-of-mass energy for the nonextremal\nblack hole. We also obtain the maximal center-of-mass energy for a\nnear-extremal black hole and the result implies that the Planck-scale energy is\nhard to be approached. Furthermore, we also consider the back-reaction effects.\nThe result shows that, neglecting the gravitational radiation, it has a weak\neffect on the center-of-mass energy.

Thus either the relative coincidence of these six axes is a\nvery large statistical fluctuation or there is an underlying physical or\nsystematic reason that leads to their correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 19:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 15:54:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2010 15:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The movement and energy supplying\nto the dipole BL are due to the atmospheric electric field. Crucial for the\ndetailed analysis of BL is using the new relation of balance of the force of\natmospheric electric field (per unit mass of electron cloud) and dipole forces\nelectrons-ions within BL dipole (per unit mass of BL) as the first necessary\ncondition for the existance of BL as an integer. This model is unique because,\nunlike existing static models, fundamental condition for the existence of Ball\nLightning is its forward motion. The virial theorem limiting BL power does not\napply to BL which is not closed system like the Sun or Galaxy systems and is\nstrongly dependent part of the infinitely extended in time and space large\nsystem. Stability of BL is due to two free parameters with the fundamental role\nof thermodynamic non-equilibrium, ionization, recombination and translational\nmovement with energy loss by radiation and also excess volumetric positive\ncharge. Stability of BL is not related to the presence of any external shells.\nPolarization degree of BL plasma is characterized by polarizability factor\n{\\gamma}. An example is presented of calculating the stability of an option of\nBL. There is also a possible connection of stability BL with statistical\ndistributions of the atmospheric electric field in time and space. Destruction\nof BL can also occur due to arising kinematical instability at its accelerating\n(or decelerating) movement. Maximal energy density in BL DDM does not exceed\nthe value Espec<(10(8) - 10(9)) J/m(3) decreasing with the growing BL radius.\nResulting indefinitely long BL lifetime is also discussed.

In this work we study the\nstellar populations of the sample galaxies by fitting their spectra using\nULySS, which is a robust full spectrum fitting method. We fit each of the\nsample with 1-population (a single stellar population-a SSP) and 3-population\n(3 SSPs) models, separately. By 1-population fits, we obtain SSP-equivalent\nages and metallicities which correspond to the `luminosity-weighted' averages.\nBy 3-population fits, we divide components into three groups in age (old\nstellar population-OSP, intermediate-age stellar population-ISP, and young\nstellar population-YSP), and then get the optimal age, metallicity and\npopulation fractions in both mass and light for OSP, ISP and YSP. During the\nfits, both Pegase.HR/Elodie3.1 and Vazdekis/Miles are used as two independent\npopulation models. The two models result in generally consistent conclusions as\nfollows: for all the sample galaxies, YSPs (< 1Gyr) make important\ncontributions to the light. However, the dominant contributors to mass are\nOSPs. We also reconstruct the smoothing star formation histories (SFHs) by\ngiving star formation rate (SFR) versus evolutionary age. In addition, we fit\nthe E+A sample and 34 randomly selected elliptical galaxies with 2-population\n(2 SSPs) model. We obtain the equivalent age of old components for each of the\nE+A sample and elliptical galaxies.

If dielectric media are involved, however, the\nanalysis becomes more delicate, not least since one encounters the\nelectromagnetic energy-momentum problem in matter, the `Abraham-Minkowski\nenigma', of what the momentum is of a photon in matter. We analyze the momentum\nbalance in three nontrivial examples obeying azimuthal symmetry, showing how\nthe momentum conservation is satisfied as the magnetic field decays and\nmomentum is transferred to bodies present. In the last of the examples, that of\npoint charge outside a dielectric sphere in an infinite magnetic field, we find\nthat not all of the field momentum is transferred to the nearby bodies; a part\nof the momentum appears to vanish as momentum flux towards infinity.

The list\ncurrently contains 235,064 high quality spectra which show no peculiarities and\nbelong to 210,872 different stars. The numbers will grow as the RAVE survey\nprogresses. The public version of the catalog will be made available through\nthe CDS services along with the ongoing RAVE public data releases.\n  The distances are determined with a method based on the work by Breddels et\nal.~(2010). Here we assume that the star undergoes a standard stellar evolution\nand that its spectrum shows no peculiarities. The refinements include: the use\nof either of the three isochrone sets, a better account of the stellar ages and\nmasses, use of more realistic errors of stellar parameter values, and\napplication to a larger dataset. The derived distances of both dwarfs and\ngiants match within ~21% to the astrometric distances of Hipparcos stars and to\nthe distances of observed members of open and globular clusters. Multiple\nobservations of a fraction of RAVE stars show that repeatability of the derived\ndistances is even better, with half of the objects showing a distance scatter\nof \\simlt 11%.\n  RAVE dwarfs are ~300 pc from the Sun, and giants are at distances of 1 to 2\nkpc, and up to 10 kpc. This places the RAVE dataset between the more local\nGeneva-Copenhagen survey and the more distant and fainter SDSS sample. As such\nit is ideal to address some of the fundamental questions of Galactic structure\nand evolution in the pre-Gaia era.

Satisfying these requirements depends on the\nintegrity of the rubbing surface and its suitability to sliding conditions. As\nsuch, designers currently focus on constructing surfaces that are an integral\npart of the function of the tribo-system. Inspirations for such constructs come\nfrom studying natural systems and from implementing natural design rules. One\nspecies that may serve as an analogue for design is the Ball python. This is\nbecause such a creature while depending on legless locomotion when sliding\nagainst various surfaces, many of which are deemed tribologically hostile,\ndoesn't sustain much damage. Resistance to damage in this case originates from\nsurface design features. As such, studying these features and how do they\ncontribute to the control of friction and wear is very attractive for design\npurposes. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization approach\nto study surface design features of the Python regius that are beneficial to\ndesign high quality lubricating surfaces (such as those obtained through\nplateau honing). To this end, we studied topographical features by SEM and\nthrough White Light Interferrometery (WLI).

By means of measures of\nchemical abundances now available for the galaxies hosting such events,thought\nto originate from the explosion of very powerful supernovae (Type Ib/c), we\nhave the opportunity to study the nature of these host galaxies. The aim of\nthis paper is to identify the hosts of Long GRBs (LGRBs) observed both at low\nand high redshift to see whether the hosts can be galaxies of the same type\nobserved at different cosmic epochs. We adopt detailed chemical evolution\nmodels for galaxies of different morphological type (ellipticals, spirals,\nirregulars) which follow the time evolution of the abundances of several\nchemical elements (H, He, $\\alpha$-elements, Fe), and compare the results with\nthe observed abundances and abundance ratios in galaxies hosting LGRBs. We find\nthat the abundances and abundance ratios predicted by models devised for\ntypical irregular galaxies can well fit the abundances in the hosts both at\nhigh and low redshift. We also find that the predicted Type Ib/c supernova rate\nfor irregulars is in good agreement with observations. Models for spirals and\nparticularly ellipticals do not fit the high-redshift hosts of LGRBs (DLA\nsystems) nor the low redshift hosts: in particular, ellipticals cannot possibly\nbe the hosts of gamma-ray-bursts at low redshift since they do not show any\nstar formation, and therefore no supernovae Ib/c. We conclude that the observed\nabundance and abundance ratios in LGRBs hosts suggest that these hosts are\nirregular galaxies both at high and low redshift thus showing that the host\ngalaxies belong to in an evolutionary sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 12:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2010 10:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-03"}

Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on\nthe fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known\nto have a remarkably low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its\nsubstrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling\nand raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical\nconstraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing\nthe measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms in various\nenvironments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of\nRubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is\nmanifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters.\nWithin this one dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and\nstructural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular\nenvironment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly\noptimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main\ndeterminant of its efficiency but rather the tradeoff between the carboxylation\nvelocity and CO2 affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only\nmoderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined\nmostly by the local CO2 concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally\ntestable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection\npressure and to biochemical constraints which strongly confine the evolutionary\nplasticity to a low dimensional landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 13:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

We consider molecular recognition as a\ntransmission of information via a noisy channel and use this analogy to gain\ninsights on the optimal, or fittest, molecular recognizer. We focus on the\noptimal structural properties of the molecules such as flexibility and\nconformation. We show that conformational changes upon binding, which often\noccur during molecular recognition, may optimize the detection performance of\nthe recognizer. We thus suggest a generic design principle termed\n'conformational proofreading' in which deformation enhances detection.

As a\nconsequence one expects a metastable behavior with rare jumps between the two\nphases combined with a fast thermalization inside each phase. However the\nenergy barrier between these two phases is only logarithmic in the system size\nL and therefore the two relevant time scales are only polynomial in L with no\nclear-cut separation between them.

We discuss how the biological problem of\nmaximizing the fitness of an organism by optimizing its molecular coding\nmachinery is equivalent to the communication engineering problem of designing\nan optimal information channel. The fitness of a molecular code takes into\naccount the interplay between the quality of the channel and the cost of\nresources which the organism needs to invest in its construction and\nmaintenance. We analyze the dynamics of a population of organisms that compete\naccording to the fitness of their codes. The model suggests a generic mechanism\nfor the emergence of molecular codes as a phase transition in an information\nchannel.

They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several\nsuper-families, each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total number\nof transcription factors encoded in a genome increases with the number of genes\nin the genome. Here, we examined the number of transcription factors from each\nsuper-family in diverse organisms.\n  We find that the number of transcription factors from most super-families\nappears to be bounded. For example, the number of winged helix factors does not\ngenerally exceed 300, even in very large genomes. The magnitude of the maximal\nnumber of transcription factors from each super-family seems to correlate with\nthe number of DNA bases effectively recognized by the binding mechanism of that\nsuper-family. Coding theory predicts that such upper bounds on the number of\ntranscription factors should exist, in order to minimize cross-binding errors\nbetween transcription factors. This theory further predicts that factors with\nsimilar binding sequences should tend to have similar biological effect, so\nthat errors based on mis-recognition are minimal. We present evidence that\ntranscription factors with similar binding sequences tend to regulate genes\nwith similar biological functions, supporting this prediction.\n  The present study suggests limits on the transcription factor repertoire of\ncells, and suggests coding constraints that might apply more generally to the\nmapping between binding sites and biological function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

In this article, the definition of qualification\nis extended and three different levels are introduced: weak, strong and\noptimal. It is shown that the weak qualification extends the definition\nintroduced by Mathe and Pereverzev in 2003, mainly in the sense that the\nfunctions associated to orders of convergence and source sets need not be the\nsame. It is shown that certain methods possessing infinite classical\nqualification, e.g. truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), Landweber's\nmethod and Showalter's method, also have generalized qualification leading to\nan optimal order of convergence of the regularization error. Sufficient\nconditions for a SRM to have weak qualification are provided and necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a given order of convergence to be strong or optimal\nqualification are found. Examples of all three qualification levels are\nprovided and the relationships between them as well as with the classical\nconcept of qualification and the qualification introduced by Mathe and\nPerevezev are shown. In particular, spectral regularization methods having\nextended qualification in each one of the three levels and having zero or\ninfinite classical qualification are presented. Finally several implications of\nthis theory in the context of orders of convergence, converse results and\nmaximal source sets for inverse ill-posed problems, are shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 22:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}
