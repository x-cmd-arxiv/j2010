The\nfits performed in the 0.6-10 keV band give consistent results with respect to a\nprevious XMM-Newton observation, i.e. the lack of a soft excess, warm\nabsorption along the line of sight, a large Compton reflection component (R~1)\nand the absence of a relativistic component of the neutral iron K$\\alpha$\nemission line. However, when the PIN and Swift BAT data are included, the\nreflection amount drops significantly (R~0.2-0.3), and a relativistic iron line\nis required, the latter confirmed by a phenomenological analysis in a\nrestricted energy band (3-10 keV). When a self-consistent model is applied to\nthe whole broadband data, the observed reflection component appears to be all\nassociated to the relativistic component of the iron K$\\alpha$ line.

The very low accretion\nrate of NGC7213 could explain the lack of relativistic signatures in its\nspectrum, but the absence of the torus in both sources is more difficult to\nexplain, since their luminosities are comparable, and their accretion rates are\ncompletely different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 17:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Although this model (the DLH model) contains scalar field\nmatter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has\nbiaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality\nreduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the\nbig-bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate\ntransformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal\ntime for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the\ncoordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping\nfrom DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We\npresent explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a\nscalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible\nin terms of elliptic integrals. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT\ncoordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub\nregion, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two\nNUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the\ncomplete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions\ncorrespond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of\nthe well-known `pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the\ntraditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the\nphysically more meaningful DLH coordinates.

The aim of this paper is to introduce the\nnotion of paired VC-dimension, a generalization of VC-dimension to set-systems\nendowed with a graph structure, hence a collection of pairs of subsets.\n  The classical VC-theory is generally used in combinatorics to bound the\ntransversality of a hypergraph in terms of its fractional transversality and\nits VC-dimension. Similarly, we bound the chromatic number in terms of\nfractional transversality and paired VC-dimension.

The goal is to maximize the number of allocations.\n  We present an online algorithm for this problem with a competitive ratio of\n0.702. Before our result, algorithms with a competitive ratio better than\n$1-1/e$ were known under the assumption that the expected number of arriving\nballs of each type is integral. A key idea of the algorithm is to collect\nstatistics about the decisions of the optimum offline solution using Monte\nCarlo sampling and use those statistics to guide the decisions of the online\nalgorithm. We also show that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of\n0.705 when the rates are integral.\n  On the hardness side, we prove that no online algorithm can have a\ncompetitive ratio better than 0.823 under the known distribution model (and\nhenceforth under the permutation model). This improves upon the 5/6 hardness\nresult proved by Goel and Mehta \\cite{GM08} for the permutation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 20:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2011 16:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-03"}

The study covers both the 122 (AFe2As2; A=Ca, Sr,\nBa) and 1111 (AFeAsF; A=Ca, Sr) phases. We extend our recent work on the Ca\n(122 and 1111) and Ba (122) cases by treating computationally and\nexperimentally the 122 and 1111 Sr compounds. The effect of magnetic ordering\nis investigated through detailed non-magnetic and magnetic lattice dynamical\ncalculations. The comparison of the experimental and calculated phonon spectra\nshows that the magnetic interactions/ordering have to be included in order to\nreproduce well the measured density of states. This highlights a\nspin-correlated phonon behavior which is more pronounced than the apparently\nweak electron-phonon coupling estimated in these materials. Furthermore, there\nis no noticeable difference between phonon spectra of the 122 Ba and Sr,\nwhereas there are substantial differences when comparing these to CaFe2As2\noriginating from different aspects of structure and bonding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2010 10:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Recently it was shown how conformal\ngeometry provides a description of physics manifestly invariant under local\nchoices of unit systems. Strikingly, Einstein's equations are then equivalent\nto the existence of a parallel scale tractor (a six component vector subject to\na certain first order covariant constancy condition at every point in four\ndimensional spacetime). These results suggest a six dimensional description of\nfour dimensional physics, a viewpoint promulgated by the two times physics\nprogram of Bars. The Fefferman--Graham construction relies on a triplet of\noperators corresponding, respectively to a curved six dimensional light cone,\nthe dilation generator and the Laplacian. These form an sp(2) algebra which\nBars employs as a first class algebra of constraints in a six-dimensional gauge\ntheory. In this article four dimensional gravity is recast in terms of six\ndimensional quantum mechanics by melding the two times and tractor approaches.\nThis \"parent\" formulation of gravity is built from an infinite set of six\ndimensional fields.
