Heating\nand cooling scans about the N-SmA transition temperature were repeatedly\nperformed on pure and six 8CB+hex samples having hexane molar concentration\nranging from x_{hex}= 0.02 to 0.12.

To this end, we must identify and\nexploit observables sensitive to weak magnetic fields (B<100 G) and to the\npresence of cool and hot gas in the bulk of the solar chromosphere. Here we\nreport on an investigation of the Hanle effect in two semi-empirical models of\nthe quiet solar atmosphere with different chromospheric thermal structures. Our\nstudy reveals that scattering polarization in the Ca II IR triplet has thermal\nand magnetic sensitivities potentially of great diagnostic value. The linear\npolarization in the 8498 A line shows a strong sensitivity to inclined magnetic\nfields with strengths between 0.001 and 10 G, while the emergent linear\npolarization in the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is mainly sensitive to magnetic\nfields with strengths between 0.001 and 0.1 G. The reason for this is that the\nscattering polarization of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines, unlike the 8498 A line,\nis controlled mainly by the Hanle effect in their (metastable) lower levels.\nTherefore, in regions with magnetic strengths sensibly larger than 1 G, their\nStokes Q and U profiles are sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic\nfield vector. We also find that for given magnetic field configurations the\nsign of the Q/I and U/I profiles of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is the same in\nboth atmospheric models, while the sign of the linear polarization profile of\nthe 8498 A line turns out to be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the\nlower chromosphere. We suggest that spectropolarimetric observations providing\ninformation on the relative scattering polarization amplitudes of the Ca II IR\ntriplet will be very useful to improve our empirical understanding of the\nthermal and magnetic structure of the quiet chromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 17:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

While in certain cases the\nproblem can be reduced to the study of a self-similar action of an automorphism\ngroup of a regular tree, our geometric technique is more general, as it applies\nto cases where the action is not self-similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 18:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2011 11:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2012 11:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

In the collapsar\nmodel for LGRBs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launching\nfrom the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of the\ncollapse of a rotating progenitor star. The jet is collimated along the star's\nrotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should be\nrelatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize a\nsubstantial mass of 56Ni. Our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment of\nthe possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,\nwhich powers the LGRB, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass in\nthe envelope to produce a luminous supernova. For this, the energy dissipated\nnear the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it can\ndrive a supernova-like shockwave. Here we suggest that the energy is\ntransported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying on\nglobal mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. The\nmodel suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope and\nthat ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. The efficiency with which the\naccretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by the\ncompetition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from the\nblack hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, the\nmagnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum of\nthe infalling envelope. Substantial masses of 56Ni may be synthesized in the\nconvective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initial\ncircularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. The\nsynthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburned\nejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 20:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2011 16:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, in many reconnecting systems in high-energy\nastrophysics (e.g., accretion-disk coronae, relativistic jets, magnetar flares)\nand, potentially, in powerful laser plasma and z-pinch experiments, the energy\ndensity is so high that radiation, in particular radiative cooling, may start\nto play an important role. This observation motivates the development of a\ntheory of high-energy-density radiative magnetic reconnection. As a first step\ntowards this goal, we present in this paper a simple Sweet--Parker-like theory\nof non-relativistic resistive-MHD reconnection with strong radiative cooling.\nFirst, we show how, in the absence of a guide magnetic field, intense cooling\nleads to a strong compression of the plasma in the reconnection layer,\nresulting in a higher reconnection rate. The compression ratio and the layer\ntemperature are determined by the balance between ohmic heating and radiative\ncooling. The lower temperature in the radiatively-cooled layer leads to a\nhigher Spitzer resistivity and hence to an extra enhancement of the\nreconnection rate. We then apply our general theory to several specific\nastrophysically important radiative processes (bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and\ninverse-Compton) in the optically thin regime, for both the zero- and\nstrong-guide-field cases. We derive specific expressions for key reconnection\nparameters, including the reconnection rate. We also discuss the limitations\nand conditions for applicability of our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 21:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By\nexploiting the \"formulas-as-types\" notion, such calculi can also encode the\ncorrespondence between formulas and their proofs in typing judgments. As such,\nthese calculi provide a natural yet powerful means for specifying varied formal\nsystems. Such specifications can be transformed into a more direct form that\nuses predicate formulas over simply typed lambda-terms and that thereby\nprovides the basis for their animation using conventional logic programming\ntechniques. However, a naive use of this idea is fraught with inefficiencies\narising from the fact that dependently typed expressions typically contain much\nredundant typing information. We investigate syntactic criteria for recognizing\nand, hence, eliminating such redundancies.

The Balmer-line maps have similar morphologies but\nexhibit radial stratification, with progressively longer delays for Hgamma to\nHbeta to Halpha. The He I and He II response is confined within 1-2 days. There\nis a deficit of prompt response in the Balmer-line cores but strong prompt\nresponse in the red wings. Comparison with simple models identifies two classes\nthat reproduce these features: freefalling gas, and a half-illuminated disk\nwith a hotspot at small radius on the receding lune. Symmetrically illuminated\nmodels with gas orbiting in an inclined disk or an isotropic distribution of\nrandomly inclined circular orbits can reproduce the virial structure but not\nthe observed asymmetry. Radial outflows are also largely ruled out by the\nobserved asymmetry. A warped-disk geometry provides a physically plausible\nmechanism for the asymmetric illumination and hotspot features. Simple\nestimates show that a disk in the broad-line region of Arp 151 could be\nunstable to warping induced by radiation pressure. Our results demonstrate the\npotential power of detailed modeling combined with monitoring campaigns at\nhigher cadence to characterize the gas kinematics and physical processes that\ngive rise to the broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 23:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

About half of the hot main sequence stars and blue supergiants are\nfound in two regions in the inner part of NGC 1311.

The\nselection of RCB candidates was based on their near-infrared excess and on\nparticular mid-infrared emission of RCB shells, using photometric data from the\n2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. The OGLE light curves of all RCB candidates\nwere then inspected visually and the ones presenting large and fast declines\nwere followed-up spectroscopically .

We try to answer the question by proposing\na new notion called 'Soft Control', which keeps the local rule of the existing\nagents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study.\nConsider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by\nVicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but\nwith different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the\naverage of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of\nthis model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as\nsynchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior\n(headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special\nagent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an\nordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so\nthat it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control\nlaw is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft\ncontrol is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural\nway to intervene in the distributed systems.

In the\nclassical formulation, n men and n women express their preferences (via a\nstrict total order) over the members of the other sex. Solving a SM problem\nmeans finding a stable marriage where stability is an envy-free notion: no man\nand woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to\ntheir partners or to being single. We consider both the classical stable\nmarriage problem and one of its useful variations (denoted SMTI) where the men\nand women express their preferences in the form of an incomplete preference\nlist with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are\npermitted only with people who appear in these lists, an we try to find a\nstable matching that marries as many people as possible. Whilst the SM problem\nis polynomial to solve, the SMTI problem is NP-hard. We propose to tackle both\nproblems via a local search approach, which exploits properties of the problems\nto reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. We\nevaluate empirically our algorithm for SM problems by measuring its runtime\nbehaviour and its ability to sample the lattice of all possible stable\nmarriages. We evaluate our algorithm for SMTI problems in terms of both its\nruntime behaviour and its ability to find a maximum cardinality stable\nmarriage.For SM problems, the number of steps of our algorithm grows only as\nO(nlog(n)), and that it samples very well the set of all stable marriages. It\nis thus a fair and efficient approach to generate stable marriages.Furthermore,\nour approach for SMTI problems is able to solve large problems, quickly\nreturning stable matchings of large and often optimal size despite the\nNP-hardness of this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 10:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-07"}

In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form\nexpressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are\navailable. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed\nnumerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain\ncomputationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize\n(w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the\naverage mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this\nasymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices\nmethods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of\nthe input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated\nat the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up\nto a O(1/t) term, where t is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm\nbased on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average\nmutual information approximation, and its convergence studied. Numerical\nsimulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and\nreceive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct\nmaximization approaches of the average mutual information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 12:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2011 14:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-13"}

However, relatively\nlittle is known as to what network features differ between the cancer and\nnormal cell physiologies, or between different cancer cell phenotypes. Based on\nthe observation that frequent genomic alterations underlie a more aggressive\ncancer phenotype, we asked if such an effect could be detectable as an increase\nin the randomness of local gene expression patterns. Using a breast cancer gene\nexpression data set and a model network of protein interactions we derive\nconstrained weighted networks defined by a stochastic information flux matrix\nreflecting expression correlations between interacting proteins. Based on this\nstochastic matrix we propose and compute an entropy measure that quantifies the\ndegree of randomness in the local pattern of information flux around single\ngenes. By comparing the local entropies in the non-metastatic versus metastatic\nbreast cancer networks, we here show that breast cancers that metastasize are\ncharacterised by a small yet significant increase in the degree of randomness\nof local expression patterns. We validate this result in three additional\nbreast cancer expression data sets and demonstrate that local entropy better\ncharacterises the metastatic phenotype than other non-entropy based measures.\nWe show that increases in entropy can be used to identify genes and signalling\npathways implicated in breast cancer metastasis. Further exploration of such\nintegrated cancer expression and protein interaction networks will therefore be\na fruitful endeavour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 12:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 13:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

The D = 10 case corresponds to the\nIIB matrix model, which was proposed as a non-perturbative formulation of type\nIIB superstring theory, and the spontaneous breaking corresponds to the\ndynamical compactification of space-time suggested in that model. First we\nstudy the D = 6 case by the Gaussian expansion method, which turns out to yield\nclearer results than the previous results for the D = 10 case for certain\ntechnical reasons. By comparing the free energy of the SO(d) symmetric vacua\nfor d = 2, 3, 4, 5, we conclude that the breaking SO(6) \\to SO(3) actually\noccurs.

It turns out that also the wave-mechanical description of a system\nof n such bosons/fermions and its second quantization is simplified if we\ntranslate them in terms of their deformed counterparts. The latter are obtained\nby a general twist-induced *-deformation procedure which deforms in a\ncoordinated way not just the spacetime algebra, but the larger algebra\ngenerated by any number n of copies of the spacetime coordinates and by the\nparticle creation and annihilation operators. On the deformed algebra the\naction of the original spacetime transformations looks twisted. In a\nnon-conservative view, we thus obtain a twisted covariant framework for QFT on\nthe corresponding noncommutative spacetime consistent with quantum mechanical\naxioms and Bose-Fermi statistics.

METHODS: In its high-resolution mode\n(HRS) the Herschel Heterodyne Instrument for the Infrared (HIFI) offers a\nfrequency resolution of 0.125 MHz, corresponding to a line-of-sight velocity of\n0.06 km/s, which we employed to obtain the strength and linear polarisation of\nmaser spikes in the spectrum of VY CMa at 620.701 GHz.

This trend likely follows from properties of the\nprogenitor white dwarf (WD), such as central density, that follow from\nproperties of the host stellar population. We present a statistically\nwell-controlled, systematic study utilizing a suite of multi-dimensional SNeIa\nsimulations investigating the influence of central density of the progenitor WD\non the production of Fe-group material, particularly radioactive Ni-56, which\npowers the light curve. We find that on average, as the progenitor's central\ndensity increases, production of Fe-group material does not change but\nproduction of Ni-56 decreases. We attribute this result to a higher rate of\nneutronization at higher density. The central density of the progenitor is\ndetermined by the mass of the WD and the cooling time prior to the onset of\nmass transfer from the companion, as well as the subsequent accretion heating\nand neutrino losses. The dependence of this density on cooling time, combined\nwith the result of our central density study, offers an explanation for the\nobserved age-luminosity correlation: a longer cooling time raises the central\ndensity at ignition thereby producing less Ni-56 and thus a dimmer event.

It has been suggested\nthat a very efficient way to grow protoplanets is by accreting particles of\nsize <<km (e.g., chondrules, boulders, or fragments of larger bodies) as they\ncan be kept dynamically cold. We investigate the effects of gas drag on the\nimpact radii and the accretion rates of these particles. As simplifying\nassumptions we restrict our analysis to 2D settings, a gas drag law linear in\nvelocity, and a laminar disk characterized by a smooth (global) pressure\ngradient that causes particles to drift in radially. These approximations,\nhowever, enable us to cover an arbitrary large parameter space. The framework\nof the circularly restricted three body problem is used to numerically\nintegrate particle trajectories and to derive their impact parameters. Three\naccretion modes can be distinguished: hyperbolic encounters, where the 2-body\ngravitational focusing enhances the impact parameter; three-body encounters,\nwhere gas drag enhances the capture probability; and settling encounters, where\nparticles settle towards the protoplanet. An analysis of the observed behavior\nis presented; and we provide a recipe to analytically calculate the impact\nradius, which confirms the numerical findings. We apply our results to the\nsweepup of fragments by a protoplanet at a distance of 5 AU. Accretion of\ndebris on small protoplanets (<50 km) is found to be slow, because the\nfragments are distributed over a rather thick layer. However, the newly found\nsettling mechanism, which is characterized by much larger impact radii, becomes\nrelevant for protoplanets of ~10^3 km in size and provides a much faster\nchannel for growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 15:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In cavities having\nmultiple degenerate modes, the quasi-continuum of possible lattice\narrangements, and the continuous symmetry breaking associated with the adoption\nof a particular lattice arrangement, give rise to phenomena such as phonons,\ndefects, and frustration, which have hitherto been unexplored in ultracold\natomic settings involving neutral atoms. The present work develops a\nnonequilibrium field-theoretic approach to explore the self-organization of a\nBEC in a pumped, lossy optical cavity. We find that the transition is well\ndescribed, in the regime of primary interest, by an effective equilibrium\ntheory. At nonzero temperatures, the self-organization occurs via a\nfluctuation-driven first-order phase transition of the Brazovskii class; this\ntransition persists to zero temperature, and crosses over into a quantum phase\ntransition of a new universality class. We make further use of our\nfield-theoretic description to investigate the role of nonequilibrium\nfluctuations on the self-organization transition, as well as to explore the\nnucleation of ordered-phase droplets, the nature and energetics of topological\ndefects, supersolidity in the ordered phase, and the possibility of frustration\ncontrolled by the cavity geometry.

The wide\ncomponent must come from another region, with a probably non-negligible\ncontribution from the material ejected during the 1967 outburst. Non-orbital\nvariations of the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width were found both on long and short\ntime scales. Similar variations were found in the photometry, showing a\ncomponent with a clear dependence on the orbital phase, but no obvious relation\nwith the H$\\alpha$ variations. The orbital part of the photometric variations\ncan be explained by irradiation of the companion, while the properties of\nH$\\alpha$ are explicable by the presence of an accretion disk and a spot bright\nin H$\\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 15:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We do this\nfirst for near-circular orbits as a natural expansion of an existing orbital\nmodel for low-eccentricity binary systems. The amplitudes of the 3rd and higher\nharmonics can be described by two new post-Keplerian (PK) parameters\nproportional to the amplitudes of the third and fourth harmonics (h_3, h_4).\nFor high orbital inclinations we use a PK parameter proportional to the ratio\nof amplitudes of successive harmonics (sigma) instead of h_4. The new PK\nparameters are much less correlated with each other than r and s and provide a\nsuperior description of the constraints introduced by the Shapiro delay on the\norbital inclination and the masses of the components of the binary (...). We\nextend the h_3,sigma parameterisation to eccentric binaries with high orbital\ninclinations. For some such binaries we can measure extra PK parameters and\ntest general relativity using the Shapiro delay parameters. In this case we can\nuse the measurement of h_3 as a test of general relativity. We show that this\nnew test is not only more stringent than the r test, but it is even more\nstringent than the previous s test. Until now this new parametric test could\nonly be derived statistically from an analysis of a probabilistic chi2 map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 15:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
