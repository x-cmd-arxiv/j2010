First,\nsuch problems correspond to natural extensions of the well-known secretary\nproblem for hiring an organization with a hierarchical structure. Second, from\na purely combinatorial perspective, our problems are interesting variations on\nsimilar longest increasing subsequence problems, a problem paradigm that has\nled to many deep mathematical connections.\n  We provide several basic results. We obtain an efficient algorithm for\ndetermining the heapability of a sequence, and also prove that the question of\nwhether a sequence can be arranged in a complete binary heap is NP-hard.\nRegarding subsequences we show that, with high probability, the longest\nheapable subsequence of a random permutation of n numbers has length (1 - o(1))\nn, and a subsequence of length (1 - o(1)) n can in fact be found online with\nhigh probability. We similarly show that for a random permutation a subsequence\nthat yields a complete heap of size \\alpha n for a constant \\alpha can be found\nwith high probability.

In order to test the latter idea, we developed\nMonte Carlo simulations of the photospheric \"magnetic carpet\" and extrapolated\nthe time-varying coronal field. These models were constructed for a range of\ndifferent magnetic flux imbalance ratios. Completely balanced models represent\nquiet regions on the Sun and source regions of slow solar wind streams. Highly\nimbalanced models represent coronal holes and source regions of fast wind\nstreams. The models agree with observed emergence rates, surface flux\ndensities, and number distributions of magnetic elements.

We computed the rate at which closed field lines open\nup (i.e., recycling times for open flux), and we estimated the energy flux\nreleased in reconnection events involving the opening up of closed flux tubes.\nFor quiet regions and mixed-polarity coronal holes, these energy fluxes were\nfound to be much lower than required to accelerate the solar wind. For the most\nimbalanced coronal holes, the energy fluxes may be large enough to power the\nsolar wind, but the recycling times are far longer than the time it takes the\nsolar wind to accelerate into the low corona.

Such an effective theory is\nuseful when the spectrum contains a hierarchy in the dimension of operators,\nand a small parameter whose role is similar to that of 1/N in a large N gauge\ntheory. These criteria insure that there is a regime where the dilatation\noperator is modified perturbatively. Global AdS is the natural framework for\nperturbations of the dilatation operator respecting conformal invariance, much\nas Minkowski space naturally describes Lorentz invariant perturbations of the\nHamiltonian. Assuming that the lowest-dimension single-trace operator is a\nscalar, O, we consider the anomalous dimensions, gamma(n,l), of the\ndouble-trace operators of the form O (del^2)^n (del)^l O. Purely from the CFT\nwe find that perturbative unitarity places a bound on these dimensions of\n|gamma(n,l)|<4. Non-renormalizable AdS interactions lead to violations of the\nbound at large values of n. We also consider the case that these interactions\nare generated by integrating out a heavy scalar field in AdS. We show that the\npresence of the heavy field \"unitarizes\" the growth in the anomalous\ndimensions, and leads to a resonance-like behavior in gamma(n,l) when n is\nclose to the dimension of the CFT operator dual to the heavy field. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that bulk flat-space S-matrix elements can be extracted from the\nlarge n behavior of the anomalous dimensions.

High resolution X-ray observations of classical T Tauri stars\n(CTTSs) show a soft X-ray excess due to high density plasma (n_e=10^11-10^13\ncm^-3). This emission has been attributed to shock-heated accreting material\nimpacting onto the stellar surface. Aims. We investigate the observability of\nthe shock-heated accreting material in the X-ray band as a function of the\naccretion stream properties (velocity, density, and metal abundance) in the\ncase of plasma-beta<<1 in the post-shock zone. Methods. We use a 1-D\nhydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the\nchromosphere, including the effects of radiative cooling, gravity and thermal\nconduction. We explore the space of relevant parameters and synthesize from the\nmodel results the X-ray emission in the [0.5-8.0] keV band and in the resonance\nlines of O VII (21.60 Ang) and Ne IX (13.45 Ang), taking into account the\nabsorption from the chromosphere. Results. The accretion stream properties\ninfluence the temperature and the stand-off height of the shocked slab and its\nsinking in the chromosphere, determining the observability of the shocked\nplasma. Our model predicts that X-ray observations preferentially detect\nemission from low density and high velocity shocked accretion streams due to\nthe large absorption of dense post-shock plasma. In all the cases examined, the\npost-shock zone exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations due to thermal\ninstabilities, but in the case of inhomogeneous streams and beta<<1, the shock\noscillations are hardly detectable. Conclusions. We suggest that, if accretion\nstreams are inhomogeneous, the selection effect introduced by the absorption on\nobservable plasma components may explain the discrepancy between the accretion\nrate measured by optical and X-ray data as well as the different densities\nmeasured using different He-like triplets in the X-ray band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 20:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The same models,\nbased on the linear Schrodinger equation with time-dependent trapping\npotentials, apply to the description of optical planar systems designed for the\nswitching of trapped light beams. The analysis is carried out in the analytical\nform, using exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation. The first dynamical\nproblem considered in this work is the retention of a particle released from a\ntrap which was suddenly turned off, while another local trap was switched on at\na distance - immediately or with a delay. In this case, we demonstrate that the\nmaximum of the retention rate is achieved at a specific finite value of the\nstrength of the new trap, and at a finite value of the temporal delay,\ndepending on the distance between the two traps. Another ptoblem is retrapping\nof the bound particle when the addition of the second trap transforms the\nsingle-well setting into a double-well potential (DWP). In that case, we find\nprobabilities for the retrapping into the ground or first excited state of the\nDWP. We also analyze effects entailed by the application of a kick to a bound\nparticle, the most interesting one being a kick-induced transition between the\nDWP's ground and excited states. In the latter case, the largest transition\nprobability is achieved at particular strength of the kick.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 20:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A 1 -- 2 MK plasma of Fe contributes\n85% of the total emission in the CHIPS passband. The standard Differential\nEmission Measures (DEMs) supplied with the CHIANTI package do not fit the CHIPS\nspectra well as they over-predict emission at temperatures below log(T) = 6.0\nand above log(T) = 6.3. The results are important for cross-calibrating TIMED,\nSORCE, SOHO/EIT, and CDS/GIS, as well as the recently launched Solar Dynamics\nObservatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 21:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-16"}

We conclude that the\nreference site can generate a Bell state with a vertex if the corresponding\nupper bound of the vertex is 1 e-bit. Thus for generation of a Bell state this\nupper bound must be saturated. Taking this into account, we obtain the\ncharacteristic constraint of the proper graphs. We introduce a special class of\nantipodal invariant stratification graphs, which is called reflective, whereas\nthe antipode vertex obeys the characteristic constraint. We also show that the\nantipodal association scheme graphs are reflective so Bell states can be\ngenerated between the antipodal vertices.

As the separation of the sightlines increases\nfrom 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. At the\nlargest separations, the CIV systems cluster similar to Lyman-break galaxies\n(Adelberger et al. 2005a).

The model has been improved significantly in four major aspects:\ni)it is proved that in center of mass frame and in internal coordinate Hilbert\nsubspace, the total angular momentum $J$ of meson is conserved and the mass\neigen equation can be expressed in total angular momentum representation and in\nterms of a set of coupled radial eigen equations for each $J$. ii)Based on\nlattice QCD results, a relativistic confining potential is introduced into the\neffective interaction and the excited states of mesons can be well described.\niii)an SU(3) flavor mixing interaction is introduced phenomenologically to\ndescribe the flavor mixing mesons and the mass eigen equations contain the\ncoupling among different flavor components. iv)the mass eigen equations are of\nrelativistic covariance and the coupled radial mass eigen equations take full\naccount of $L-S $ coupling and tensor interactions.

We\ntreat di-neutron clustering by solving the two neutron relative wave function\nprecisely by using the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction so that the spatial\nclustering structure is obtained quantitatively within the whole 11Li nucleus.\nThis di-neutron clustering is an essential dynamics to form the halo structure\nby making a compact di-neutron cluster, which distributes loosely around the\n9Li core. The di-neutron clustering is a new concept and is a general\nphenomenon in neutron skin and neutron halo nuclei. This quantitative\ndescription of di-neutron clustering has made it necessary to consider another\nimportant deuteron-like tensor correlation, which is caused by strong tensor\ninteraction in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The tensor interaction\noriginates from pion exchange and known to provide large attraction to form the\n4He nucleus. The unique feature of the tensor correlation is to make highly\ncorrelated deuteron-like excitation, which interferes with shell model like\nstructure in a unique way. This dynamical effect removes the magic number\neffect and makes easy the participation of the s-wave neutrons. Hence, there\nare pairing and deuteron-like tensor correlations in addition to the mean field\nstructure in 9Li. The combined system of two additional neutrons with the\ncorrelated 9Li provides the halo phenomenon, in which the di-neutron clustering\ndevelops with the help of large s-wave component caused by the deuteron-like\ntensor correlation.

In this\narticle, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane\ngraphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\\geq 3$. A \\emph{Schnyder\ndecomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a\nspecific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the\nspanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if\nthe girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods\n($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations\n(\"fractional\" orientations when $d\\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings.\nMoreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d$-angulation of girth\n$d$ is a distributive lattice. We also show that the structures dual to\nSchnyder decompositions (on $d$-regular plane graphs of mincut $d$ rooted at a\nvertex $v^*$) are decompositions into $d$ spanning trees rooted at $v^*$ such\nthat each edge not incident to $v^*$ is used in opposite directions by two\ntrees. Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of\nSchnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties\nthat yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to\nwell-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and\npartitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder\ndecompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms.\nFor a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked\nvertex $v$, the vertices of $G\\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \\times\n(n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing\neach of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\\backslash v$ has exactly one bend.

The tuning curves are stationary, i.e. time\nindependent, solutions of this dynamical model. One important assumption\nunderlying the Ring Model is that the LGN input to V1 is weakly tuned to the\nretinal orientation and that it is the local computations in V1 that sharpen\nthis tuning. Because the equations that describe the Ring Model have built-in\nequivariance properties in the synaptic weight distribution with respect to a\nparticular group acting on the retinal orientation of the stimulus, the model\nin effect encodes an infinite number of tuning curves that are arbitrarily\ntranslated with respect to each other. By using the Orbit Space Reduction\ntechnique we rewrite the model equations in canonical form as functions of\npolynomials that are invariant with respect to the action of this group. This\nallows us to combine equivariant bifurcation theory with an efficient numerical\ncontinuation method in order to compute the tuning curves predicted by the Ring\nModel. Surprisingly some of these tuning curves are not tuned to the stimulus.\nWe interpret them as neural illusions and show numerically how they can be\ninduced by simple dynamical stimuli. These neural illusions are important\nbiological predictions of the model. If they could be observed experimentally\nthis would be a strong point in favour of the Ring Model.

The SNR in real observations varies from\npixel to pixel, therefore the accuracy of the field vector also varies over the\nmap. The aim of this work is to study the effect of polarimetric noise on the\ninference of magnetic field vector and the magnetic non-potentiality of a real\nsunspot. To this end, we use Hinode SOT/SP vector magnetogram of a real sunspot\nNOAA 10933 as an input to generate synthetic Stokes profiles under ME model\nassumptions. We then add normally-distributed polarimetric noise of the level\n0.5\\% of continuum intensity to these synthetic profiles and invert them again\nusing ME code. This process is repeated 100 times with different realizations\nof noise. It is found that within most of the sunspot area (> 90% area) the\nspread in the (i) field strength is less than 8 Gauss, (ii) field inclination\nis less than 1 degree, and (iii) field azimuth is less than 5 degrees. Further,\nwe determine the uncertainty in the magnetic non-potentiality of a sunspot as\ndetermined by the force-free parameter alpha_g and Spatially Averaged Signed\nShear Angle (SASSA). It is found that for the sunspot studied here these\nparameters are alpha_g = -3.5 +/- 0.37 (x 10^{-9} m^{-1}) and SASSA = -1.68 +/-\n0.014 degrees. This suggests that the SASSA is a less dispersion\nnon-potentiality parameter as compared to alpha_g. Further, we examine the\neffect of increasing noise levels viz. 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% of continuum\nintensity and find that SASSA is less vulnerable to noise as compared to\nalpha_g parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 08:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, most rotation curves are\nmeasured using emission lines from gas, which can experience additional forces\ndue to pressure. In realistic galaxy disks, the gas pressure declines with\nradius, providing additional radial support to the disk. The measured\ntangential rotation speed will therefore tend to lag the true circular velocity\nof a test particle. The gas pressure is dominated by turbulence, and we\nevaluate its likely amplitude from recent estimates of the gas velocity\ndispersion and surface density. We show that where the amplitude of the\nrotation curve is comparable to the characteristic velocities of the\ninterstellar turbulence, pressure support may lead to underestimates of the\nmass density of the underlying dark matter halo and the inner slope of its\ndensity profile. These effects may be significant for galaxies with rotation\nspeeds <75km/s, but are unlikely to be significant in higher mass galaxies. We\nfind that pressure support can be sustained over long timescales, because any\nreduction in support due to the conversion of gas into stars is compensated for\nby an inward flow of gas. However, we point to many uncertainties in assessing\nthe importance of pressure support in galaxies. Thus, while pressure support\nmay alleviate possible tensions between rotation curve observations and\nLambdaCDM on kiloparsec scales, it should not be viewed as a definitive\nsolution at this time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 11:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Of these populations, the origins of two (the Near-Earth\nAsteroids and the Long-Period Comets) are well understood, with members\noriginating in the Asteroid belt and Oort cloud, respectively. By contrast, the\nsource of the third population, the Short-Period Comets, is still under debate.\nThe proximate source of these objects is the Centaurs, a population of\ndynamically unstable objects that pass perihelion between the orbits of Jupiter\nand Neptune. However, a variety of different origins have been suggested for\nthe Centaur population. Here, we present evidence that at least a significant\nfraction of the Centaur population can be sourced from the planetary Trojan\nclouds, stable reservoirs of objects moving in 1:1 mean-motion resonance with\nthe giant planets (primarily Jupiter and Neptune). Focusing on simulations of\nthe Neptunian Trojan population, we show that an ongoing flux of objects should\nbe leaving that region to move on orbits within the Centaur population. With\nconservative estimates of the flux from the Neptunian Trojan clouds, we show\nthat their contribution to that population could be of order ~3%, while more\nrealistic estimates suggest that the Neptune Trojans could even be the main\nsource of fresh Centaurs. We suggest that further observational work is needed\nto constrain the contribution made by the Neptune Trojans to the ongoing flux\nof material to the inner Solar system, and believe that future studies of the\nhabitability of exoplanetary systems should take care not to neglect the\ncontribution of resonant objects (such as planetary Trojans) to the impact flux\nthat could be experienced by potentially habitable worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 12:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2010 07:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-16"}

Breakdown\nof the surface barrier against magnetic flux penetration at the cavity equator\nis considered to be the critical event that determines the onset of Q-drop. The\nworst case of triangular grooves with low field of first flux penetration Hp,\nas analyzed previously by Buzdin and Daumens, [1998 Physica C 294: 257], was\nadapted. This approach incorporates both the geometry of the groove and local\ncontamination via the Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappa, so the proposed model\nallows new comparisons of one effect in relation to the other. The model\npredicts equivalent reduction of Hp when either roughness or contamination were\nvaried alone, so smooth but dirty surfaces limit cavity performance about as\nmuch as rough but clean surfaces do. When in combination, contamination\nexacerbates the negative effects of roughness and vice-versa. To test the model\nwith actual data, coupons were prepared by buffered chemical polishing and\nelectropolishing, and stylus profilometry was used to obtain distributions of\nangles. From these data, curves for surface resistance generated by simple flux\nflow as a function of magnetic field were generated by integrating over the\ndistribution of angles for reasonable values of kappa. This showed that\ncombined effects of roughness and contamination indeed reduce the Q-drop onset\nfield by ~30%, and that that contamination contributes to Q-drop as much as\nroughness. The latter point may be overlooked by SRF cavity research, since\naccess to the cavity interior by spectroscopy tools is very difficult, whereas\noptical images have become commonplace. The model was extended to fit cavity\ntest data, which indicated that reduction of the superconducting gap by\ncontaminants may also play a role in Q-drop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 13:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Ligand\nbinding activates integrins by stabilizing an integrin conformation with\nseparated cytoplasmic tails, thus enabling the binding of proteins that mediate\ncytoplasmic signaling. Experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of integrin\nsignaling to ligand density and this has been accounted mainly to avidity\neffects. Based on experimental data we have developed a quantitative Monte\nCarlo model for integrin signal initiation. We show that within the\nphysiological ligand density range avidity effects cannot explain the\nsensitivity of cellular signaling to small changes in ligand density. Src\nkinases are among the first proteins to be activated, possibly by trans\nauto-phosphorylation. We calculate the extent of integrin and ligand clustering\nas well as the speed and extent of Src kinase activation by trans\nauto-phosphorylation or direct binding at different experimentally monitored\nligand densities. We find that the experimentally observed ligand density\ndependency can be reproduced if Src kinases are activated by trans\nauto-phosphorylation or some other mechanism limits integrin-dependent Src\nkinase activation. We propose that Src kinase and thus cell activation by trans\nauto-phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enable ligand-density dependent\nresponses at physiological ligand densities. The capacity to detect small\ndifferences in ligand density at a ligand density that is large enough to\npermit cell adhesion is likely to be important for haptotaxis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 14:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-16"}

A modest particle-hole asymmetry in the\nunderlying band structure is shown to lead to qualitatively different behavior\non the hole doped side than on the electron doped side. For particle-hole\nasymmetry of the sign and magnitude appropriate to high-$T_c$ cuprates, the\napproach to the insulator from the hole-doping side is found to proceed in two\nstages from a high-doping region where the properties are those of a Fermi\nliquid with moderately renormalized parameters and very weak momentum\ndependence. As doping is reduced the system first enters an intermediate doping\nregime where the Fermi liquid renormalizations are larger and the electron self\nenergy varies significantly around the Fermi surface and then passes to a small\ndoping regime characterized by a gap in some regions of the Fermi surface but\ngapless behavior in other regions. On the electron doped side the partially\ngapped regime does not occur, and the momentum dependence of the electron self\nenergy is less pronounced. Implications for the high-$T_c$ cuprates and for the\nuse of cluster dynamical mean field methods in wider classes of problems are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 15:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 18:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-04"}
