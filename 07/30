In this MAC, a node carrier-senses multiple frequency\nchannels simultaneously, and it takes the first opportunity to transmit on any\none of the channels when allowed by the CSMA backoff mechanism. We show that\nthe frequency-agile MAC can effectively 1) boost throughput and 2) remove\ntemporal starvation. Furthermore, the MAC can be implemented on the existing\nmultiple-frequency setup in Wi-Fi using multi-radio technology, and it can\nco-exist with the legacy MAC using single radio. This paper provides exact\nstationary throughput analysis for regular 1D and thin-strip 2D CSMA networks\nusing a \"transfer-matrix\" approach. In addition, accurate approximations are\ngiven for 2D grid networks. Our closed-form formulas accurately quantify the\nthroughput gain of frequency-agile CSMA. To characterize temporal starvation,\nwe use the metric of \"mean residual access time\" (MRAT). Our simulations and\nclosed-form approximations indicate that the frequency-agile MAC can totally\neliminate temporal starvation in 2D grid networks, reducing its MRAT by orders\nof magnitude. Finally, this paper presents a \"coloring theorem\" to justify the\nuse of the frequency-agile MAC in general network topologies. Our analysis and\ntheorem suggest that with enough frequency channels, the frequency-agile MAC\ncan effectively decouple the detrimental interactions between neighboring links\nresponsible for low throughput and starvation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 16:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-30"}

A quasienergy\nsurface in phase space emerges whose level spacing is governed by a rescaled\neffective Planck constant. Moreover, the well-known multiphoton transitions can\nbe reinterpreted as resonant tunneling transitions from the local maximum of\nthe quasienergy surface. Most importantly, the driving defines a quasienergy\nwell which is nonperturbative in nature. The quantum mechanical quasienergy\nstate localized at its bottom is squeezed. In the Purcell limited regime, the\npotential well is metastable and the effective local temperature close to its\nminimum is uniquely determined by the squeezing factor. The activation occurs\nin this case via dressed spin flip transitions rather than via quantum\nactivation as in other driven nonlinear quantum systems such as the quantum\nDuffing oscillator. The local maximum is in general stable. However, in\npresence of resonant coherent or dissipative tunneling transitions the system\ncan escape from it and a stationary state arises as a statistical mixture of\nquasienergy states being localized in the two basins of attraction.

With the latest infrared surveys, the number of massive protostellar\ncandidates has increased significantly.

The weakness of the M1/2-L1/2 slope\non the faint end may imply that potential well depth limits galaxy formation in\nsmall galaxies, while the stronger dependence on L1/2 on the bright end\nsuggests that baryonic physics limits galaxy formation in massive galaxies. The\nmass-radius projection of this curve can be compared to median dark matter halo\nmass profiles of LCDM halos in order to construct a virial mass-luminosity\nrelationship (Mvir-L) for galaxies that spans seven orders of magnitude in\nMvir. Independent of any global abundance or clustering information, we find\nthat (spheroidal) galaxy formation needs to be most efficient in halos of Mvir\n~ 10^12 Msun and to become inefficient above and below this scale. Moreover,\nthis profile matching technique is most accurate at the high and low luminosity\nextremes (where dark matter fractions are highest) and is therefore quite\ncomplementary to statistical approaches that rely on having a well-sampled\nluminosity function.

In the\nmagnetic scenario, whether the spin fluctuation spectrum exhibits certain\nunique fine structures is an interesting aspect for theoretical study in order\nto understand experimental observations. We investigate the detailed momentum\ndependence of the short-range spin fluctuations using a 2-orbital model in the\nself-consistent fluctuation exchange approximation and find that a common\nfeature of those fluctuations that are capable of inducing a fully gapped\ns^{\\pm} state is the momentum anisotropy with lengthened span along the\ndirection transverse to the antiferromagnetic momentum transfer. Performing a\nqualitative analysis based on the orbital character and the deviation from\nperfect nesting of the electronic structure for the 2-orbital and a more\ncomplete 5-orbital model, we gain the insight that this type of anisotropic\nspin fluctuations favor superconductivity due to their enhancement of\nintra-orbital, but inter-band, pair scattering processes. The momentum\nanisotropy leads to elliptically shaped magnetic responses which have been\nobserved in inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Meanwhile, our detailed\nstudy on the magnetic and the electronic spectrum shows that the dispersion of\nthe magnetic resonance mode in the nearly isotropic s^{\\pm} superconducting\nstate exhibits anisotropic propagating behavior in an upward pattern and the\ncoupling of the resonance mode to fermions leads to a dip feature in the\nspectral function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 20:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 19:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2010 21:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-25"}

One of the major challenges in this\nemerging highly user-centric networking paradigm is how to make these exploding\nin numbers yet, individually, of vanishing demand services available in a\ncost-effective manner. Of prime importance to the latter (and focus of this\npaper) is the determination of the optimal location for hosting a UCS. Taking\ninto account the particular characteristics of UCS, we formulate the problem as\na facility location problem and devise a distributed and highly scalable\nheuristic solution to it.\n  Key to the proposed approach is the introduction of a novel metric drawing on\nComplex Network Analysis. Given a current location of UCS, this metric helps to\na) identify a small subgraph of nodes with high capacity to act as service\ndemand concentrators; b) project on them a reduced yet accurate view of the\nglobal demand distribution that preserves the key attraction forces on UCS;\nand, ultimately, c) pave the service migration path towards its optimal\nlocation in the network. The proposed iterative UCS migration algorithm, called\ncDSMA, is extensively evaluated over synthetic and real-world network\ntopologies. Our results show that cDSMA achieves high accuracy, fast\nconvergence, remarkable insensitivity to the size and diameter of the network\nand resilience to inaccurate estimates of demands for UCS across the network.\nIt is also shown to clearly outperform local-search heuristics for service\nmigration that constrain the subgraph to the immediate neighbourhood of the\nnode currently hosting UCS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 21:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2010 19:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-03"}

Based on a proposition we put forward, we argue that\nintroducing a matter density field on a non-commutative background sets up a\nmechanism that deforms the field into two distinct fields, one residing\ndominantly on the lattice tops (hereafter, on-cell) and the other residing\ndominantly in the inter-lattice regions (hereafter, off-cell). The two fields\nhave different physical and themodynamic characterics which we describe, and\nsome of which play a role in halting collpse to a singularity. For example, not\nsurprisingly the on-cell (off-cell) fields manifest standard on-shell\n(off-shell) characteristics, respectively. Both the density and the net\nmass-energy are unchanged by the deformation mechanism. In our treatment the\nmass of a black hole defines its own size scale L of the interior region it\noccupies. Moreover, such a length is quantized, L=2N\\sqrt{\\theta}, in terms of\na minimum length scale \\sqrt{\\theta}. The approach has the advantage that there\nis no degeneracy in mass-confinement since, here, the black hole density is not\na function of the mass (as is the case in some recent treatments). The density\nis, instead a fixed quantity. As such, the approach puts an upper bound on\nblack hole density, making it a universal parameter. The picture that emerges\nis that a black hole defined on a non-commutative background is both\nnon-singular, holographic and quantized. Yet we also find, interestingly, that\nwhen taken over L the average value of the associated energy-stress tensor of\nthe fields satisfies all classical energy conditions of GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 21:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2010 19:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-06"}

We find ionizing\nfluxes throughout our simulation grids are larger than predicted by one\ndimensional slab models, thus allowing for photoionization by O stars of low\naltitude neutral clouds in the Galaxy that are also detected in Halpha. In\nprevious studies of such clouds the photoionization scenario had been rejected\nand the Halpha had been attributed to enhanced cosmic ray ionization or\nscattered light from midplane H II regions. We do find that the emission\nmeasure distributions in our simulations are wider than those derived from\nHalpha observations in the Milky Way. In addition, the horizontally averaged\nheight dependence of the gas density in the hydrodynamical models is lower than\ninferred in the Galaxy. These discrepancies are likely due to the absence of\nmagnetic fields in the hydrodynamic simulations and we discuss how\nmagnetohydrodynamic effects may reconcile models and observations.\nNevertheless, we anticipate that the inclusion of magnetic fields in the\ndynamical simulations will not alter our primary finding that midplane OB stars\nare capable of producing high altitude diffuse ionized gas in a realistic\nthree-dimensional interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 23:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

The Hydrogen column density associated to GRB 090926A is log\nN_H/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the\nrange [X/H] =3.2X10^{-3}-1.2X10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,\namong the lowest values ever observed for a GRB host galaxy. A comparison with\ngalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of GRB090926A is\nlikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. We put an upper limit to the Hydrogen\nmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ISM, which is f < 7X10^{-7}. We derive\ninformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of the\nGRB explosion. The distance of component I is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,\nwhile component II is located far away from the GRB, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. These\nvalues are compatible with that found for other GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 01:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-25"}

Numerous studies attempt to explain the intrinsic abundance scatter\nobserved in some metal-poor populations in terms of chemical inhomogeneities\ndispersed throughout the early Galactic medium due to discrete enrichment\nevents. Just how the complex data and models are to be interpreted with respect\nto \"progenitor yields\" remains an open question. Here we show that stochastic\nchemical evolution models to date have overlooked a crucial fact. Essentially\nall stars today are born in highly homogeneous star clusters and it is likely\nthat this was also true at early times. When this ingredient is included, the\noverall scatter in the abundance plane [Fe/H] vs. [X/Fe] (C-space), where X is\na nucleosynthetic element, can be much less than derived from earlier models.\nMoreover, for moderately flat cluster mass functions (gamma < 2), and/or for\nmass functions with a high mass cut-off (M_max > 10^5 M_sun), stars exhibit a\nhigh degree of clumping in C-space that can be identified even in relatively\nsmall data samples. Since stellar abundances can be modified by mass transfer\nin close binaries, clustered signatures are essential for deriving the yields\nof the first supernovae. We present a statistical test to determine whether a\ngiven set of observations exhibit such behaviour. Our initial work focusses on\ntwo dimensions in C-space, but we show that the clustering signal can be\ngreatly enhanced by additional abundance axes.

However, if the dividend payout barrier is too low to\nbe acceptable, it may result in the company's bankruptcy soon. In order to\nprotect the shareholders' profits, the managements of the company impose a\nreasonable and normal constraint on their dividend strategy, that is, the\nbankrupt probability associated with the optimal dividend payout barrier should\nbe smaller than a given risk level within a fixed time horizon.

A persistent puzzle, however, is clustering of opinions\nin human populations. The puzzle is particularly pressing if opinions vary\ncontinuously, such as the degree to which citizens are in favor of or against a\nvaccination program. Existing opinion formation models suggest that\n\"monoculture\" is unavoidable in the long run, unless subsets of the population\nare perfectly separated from each other. Yet, social diversity is a robust\nempirical phenomenon, although perfect separation is hardly possible in an\nincreasingly connected world. Considering randomness did not overcome the\ntheoretical shortcomings so far. Small perturbations of individual opinions\ntrigger social influence cascades that inevitably lead to monoculture, while\nlarger noise disrupts opinion clusters and results in rampant individualism\nwithout any social structure. Our solution of the puzzle builds on recent\nempirical research, combining the integrative tendencies of social influence\nwith the disintegrative effects of individualization. A key element of the new\ncomputational model is an adaptive kind of noise. We conduct simulation\nexperiments to demonstrate that with this kind of noise, a third phase besides\nindividualism and monoculture becomes possible, characterized by the formation\nof metastable clusters with diversity between and consensus within clusters.\nWhen clusters are small, individualization tendencies are too weak to prohibit\na fusion of clusters. When clusters grow too large, however, individualization\nincreases in strength, which promotes their splitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 09:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We combined the\nY-band data with deep J and K Hawk-I observations, and with FORS1/FORS2 U, B,\nV, R, I, and Z observations to select z-drop galaxies having Z - Y > 1, no\noptical detection and flat Y - J and Y - K colour terms. We detect 8\nhigh-quality candidates in the magnitude range Y = 25.5 - 26.5 that we add to\nthe z-drop candidates selected in two Hawk-I pointings over the GOODS-South\nfield.

For galaxies brighter than M_1500=\n-19.0, we derive a luminosity density rho_UV = 1.5^{+2.1}{-0.8} x 10^25\nerg/s/Hz/Mpc^3, implying a decrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z=6.8. We find\nthat, under standard assumptions, the emission rate of ionizing photons coming\nfrom UV bright galaxies is lower by at least a factor of two than the value\nrequired for reionization.

In most theoretical studies an\neffective one-band Hubbard (1BH) or t-J model has been used. Here, the physics\nis that of doping into a Mott-insulator, whereas the actual high-$T_c$ cuprates\nare doped charge-transfer insulators. To shed light on the related question,\nwhere the material-dependent physics enters, we compare the competing magnetic\nand superconducting phases in the ground state, the single- and two-particle\nexcitations and, in particular, the pairing interaction and its dynamics in the\nthree-band Hubbard (3BH) and 1BH-models. Using a cluster embedding scheme, i.e.\nthe variational cluster approach (VCA), we find which frequencies are relevant\nfor pairing in the two models as a function of interaction strength and doping:\nin the 3BH-models the interaction in the low- to optimal-doping regime is\ndominated by retarded pairing due to low-energy spin fluctuations with\nsurprisingly little influence of inter-band (p-d charge) fluctuations. On the\nother hand, in the 1BH-model, in addition a part comes from \"high-energy\"\nexcited states (Hubbard band), which may be identified with a non-retarded\ncontribution.

We use magnetic resonance imaging techniques to measure velocities\nand particle concentrations in flowing Newtonian fluid, yield stress fluid, and\nin a concentrated suspension of noncolloidal particles in a yield stress fluid.\nIn the Newtonian fluid, we observe that the $\\theta$-averaged strain rate\ncomponent $d_{r,\\theta}$ decreases as the inverse squared radius in the gap, in\nagreement with a Couette analogy. This allows direct comparison (without\nend-effect corrections) of the resistances to shear in vane and Couette\ngeometries. Here, the mean shear stress in the vane-in-cup geometry is slightly\nlower than in a Couette cell of same dimensions, and a little higher than when\nthe vane is embedded in an infinite medium.

In the yield stress fluid, in contrast with the usually accepted picture\nbased on simulation results from the literature, we find that the layer of\nmaterial that is sheared near the blades at low velocity is not cylindrical.\nThere is thus a significant extensional component of shear that should be taken\ninto account in the analysis. Finally and surprisingly, in the suspension, we\nobserve that a thin non-cylindrical slip layer made of the pure interstitial\nyield stress fluid appears quickly at the interface between the sheared\nmaterial and the material that moves as a rigid body between the blades. This\nfeature can be attributed to the non-symmetric trajectories of the noncolloidal\nparticles around the edges of the blades.

Using the measured H2(18)O line fluxes, which\nare less affected by line opacity than their H2(16)O counterparts, and an\nescape probability method, the column densities of H2(18)O associated with each\nemission component are derived. We infer total water abundances of 7.4E-5,\n1.0E-5, and 1.6E-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,\nrespectively. In the case of the plateau, this value is consistent with\nprevious measures of the Orion-KL water abundance as well as those of other\nmolecular outflows. In the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, these\nvalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescent\nclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhanced\nwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due to\nthe warmer dust in these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 15:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The great majority of these empirical studies rely on functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has a relatively poor temporal\nresolution. Only a handful of studies have examined networks emerging from\ndynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations\nof coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum - which has\nrecently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we\nused electroencephalography (EEG) to assess dynamic brain connectivity in ASD\nfocusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity\npatterns were distinct in ASD and control populations and reflected a double\ndissociation: ASD subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent\ndeficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with ASD\nshowed increased short-range connections in lateral-frontal electrodes. This\neffect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as ASD\nseverity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range\ncoherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that\ndistinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different\nefficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in ASD\nsubjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length\nthan controls -indicating that the topology of the network departs from\nsmall-world behaviour- and greater modularity. Together these results show that\ndelta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated\nwith ASD pathology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 15:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-02"}
