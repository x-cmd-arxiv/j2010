A\nprominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser\ninduces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The\nconcomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can\ngive rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of\nprobe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a\ncomplete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium.\nHere, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally\nequivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved\nsideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the\ncavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of\nexcitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of\ntransparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met. As a salient feature\nof EIT, the power of the control laser determines the width and depth of the\nprobe transparency window. OMIT could therefore provide a new approach for\ndelaying, slowing and storing light pulses in long-lived mechanical excitations\nof optomechanical systems, whose optical and mechanical properties can be\ntailored in almost arbitrary ways in the micro- and nano-optomechanical\nplatforms developed to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 16:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

Individual agents make myopic\nlocal decisions via social learning, that is, each agent records a private\nobservation of a noisy underlying state process, selfishly optimizes its local\nutility and then broadcasts its local decision. Given these local decisions,\nhow can a global decision maker achieve quickest time change detection when the\nunderlying state changes according to a phase-type distribution? The paper\npresents four results. First, using Blackwell dominance of measures, it is\nshown that the optimal cost incurred in social learning based quickest\ndetection is always larger than that of classical quickest detection. Second,\nit is shown that in general the optimal decision policy for social learning\nbased quickest detection is characterized by multiple thresholds within the\nspace of Bayesian distributions. Third, using lattice programming and\nstochastic dominance, sufficient conditions are given for the optimal decision\npolicy to consist of a single linear hyperplane, or, more generally, a\nthreshold curve. Estimation of the optimal linear approximation to this\nthreshold curve is formulated as a simulation-based stochastic optimization\nproblem.

Thus the ECKS gravity provides\na compelling alternative to speculative mechanisms of standard cosmic\ninflation.

On the negative side, we show that whilst DOUBLELEX and SNAKELEX are\noften effective in practice, they can leave a large number of symmetric\nsolutions in the worst case. In addition, we prove that propagating DOUBLELEX\ncompletely is NP-hard. Finally we consider how to break row, column and value\nsymmetry, correcting a result in the literature about the safeness of combining\ndifferent symmetry breaking constraints. We end with the first experimental\nstudy on how much symmetry is left by DOUBLELEX and SNAKELEX on some benchmark\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 02:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

By solving the Poisson equation with an\nassumed simple step-function distributions of the charge density in these two\nregions, the distribution of the electric field and the curvature radiation\nprocess of the accelerated particles can be calculated. In the our model, the\nproperties of the phase-averaged spectrum can be completely specified by three\ngap parameters, i.e. the fractional gap size in the outer magnetosphere, the\ngap current in the primary region and the gap size ratio between the primary\nregion and the total gap size. We discuss how these parameters affect the\nspectral properties. We argue that although the radiation mechanism in the\nouter gap is curvature radiation process, the observed gamma-ray spectrum can\nsubstantially deviate from the simple curvature spectrum because the overall\nspectrum consists of two components, i.e. the primary region and screening\nregion. In some pulsars the radiation from the screening region is so strong\nthat the photon index from 100MeV to several GeV can be as flat as $\\sim 2$.

The large-scale tidal field estimated from halos above a\nmass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scale\nenvironment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and the\nmorphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. For halos at a\nfixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment,\nparticularly the tidal field. The environmental dependence of halo assembly\ntime is primarily driven by local tidal field. The mass of the unbound fraction\nin substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the bound\nfraction is suppressed. Halos have a tendency to spin faster in stronger tidal\nfield and the trend is stronger for more massive halos. The spin vectors show\nsignificant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, as\nexpected from the tidal torque theory. Both the major and minor axes of halos\nare strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field.\nIn general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of its\nmain halo on average is younger, is more elongated, spins faster, and contains\na larger amount of substructure. Higher density environments not only provide\nmore material for halo to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal field\nthat tends to suppress halo accretion.

Historically, the core had been assumed as an singular\nisothermal sphere (SIS), and the collapse had been investigated by a\nself-similar manner. This is while the rotation and magnetic field lead to\nnon-symmetric collapse so that a spheroid shape may be occurred. Here, the\nresultant of the centrifugal force and magnetic field gradient is assumed to be\nin the normal direction of the rotational axis, and its components are supposed\nto be a fraction $\\beta$ of the local gravitational force. In this research, a\ncollapsing SIS core is considered to find the importance of the parameter\n$\\beta$ for oblateness of the mass shells which are above the head of the\nexpansion wave. We apply the Adomian decomposition method to solve the system\nof nonlinear partial differential equations because the collapse does not occur\nin a spherical symmetry with self-similar behavior. In this way, we obtain a\nsemi-analytical relation for the mass infall rate $\\dot{M}$ of the shells at\nthe envelope. Near the rotational axis, the $\\dot{M}$ decreases with increasing\nof the non-dimensional radius $\\xi$, while a direct relation is observed\nbetween $\\dot{M}$ and $\\xi$ in the equatorial regions. Also, the values of\n$\\dot{M}$ in the polar regions are greater than the equatorial values, and this\ndifference is more often at smaller values of $\\xi$. Overall, the results show\nthat before reaching the head of expansion wave, the visible shape of the\nmolecular cloud cores can evolve to oblate spheroids. The ratio of major to\nminor axes of oblate cores increases with increasing the parameter $\\beta$, and\nits value can approach to the apparently observed elongated shapes of cores in\nthe maps of molecular clouds such as Taurus and Perseus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 07:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We present a spectral\ndecomposition model that reproduces the IRS spectra over the full spectral\nrange. The model assumes two dust populations: a warm component responsible for\nthe 10\\mu m emission arising from the disk inner regions and a colder component\nresponsible for the 20-30\\mu m emission, arising from more distant regions. We\nshow evidence for a significant size distribution flattening compared to the\ntypical MRN distribution, providing an explanation for the usual boxy 10\\mu m\nfeature profile generally observed. We reexamine the crystallinity paradox,\nobservationally identified by Olofsson et al.

Our modeling results do\nnot show evidence for any correlations between the crystallinity and either the\nstar spectral type, or the X-ray luminosity (for a subset of the sample). The\nsize distribution flattening may suggests that grain coagulation is a slightly\nmore effective process than fragmentation in disk atmospheres, and that this\nimbalance may last over most of the T Tauri phase. This result may also point\ntoward small grain depletion via strong stellar winds or radiation pressure in\nthe upper layers of disk. The non negligible cold crystallinity fractions\nsuggests efficient radial mixing processes in order to distribute crystalline\ngrains at large distances from the central object, along with possible nebular\nshocks in outer regions of disks that can thermally anneal amorphous grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 09:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

For\nthe AAOmega system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope we identify a limiting\nsystematic sky subtraction accuracy which is reached after integration times of\n4-10 hours.

Although the time\nevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modelling\nstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate the\nformation of the protostar. Observing young stellar objects during these\nelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteady\naccretion. ZCMa is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embedded\nHerbig Be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a FU Orionis star. The\nHerbig Be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburst\ndetected so far. We aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studying\nthe emission region of the HI Brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer of\naccretion/ejection processes on the AU-scale in young stars. Using the\nAMBER/VLTI instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performed\nspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gas\nemitting across the Brackett gamma emission line, during and after the\noutburst. From the visibilities and differential phases, we derive\ncharacteristic sizes for the Brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometric\nmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. We find that the\nline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistent\nwith the signature of either a Keplerian disk or infall of matter. They are,\ninstead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk hole\ninside the dust sublimation radius. The disappearance of the Brackett gamma\nemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to a\nperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along the\nline of sight. Based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of the\noutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring in\nEX Ors and FU Ors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 13:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Now the one-body distribution function depends not only on the\ntranslational velocity of the center of mass but also on the angular velocity\nof the particle. Moreover, the collision rules couple both velocities,\ninvolving not only the coefficient of normal restitution but also the\ncoefficient of tangential restitution. The aim of this paper is to propose an\nextension to inelastic rough particles of a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-like kinetic\nmodel previously proposed for inelastic smooth particles. The Boltzmann\ncollision operator is replaced by the sum of three terms representing: (i) the\nrelaxation to a two-temperature local equilibrium distribution, (ii) the action\nof a nonconservative drag force proportional to the peculiar velocity, and\n(iii) the action of a nonconservative torque equal to a linear combination of\nthe angular velocity and its mean value. The three coefficients in the force\nand torque are fixed to reproduce the Boltzmann collisional rates of change of\nthe mean angular velocity and of the two granular temperatures (translational\nand rotational). A simpler version of the model is also constructed in the form\nof two coupled kinetic equations for the translational and rotational velocity\ndistributions. The kinetic model is applied to the simple shear flow steady\nstate and the combined influence of the two coefficients of restitution on the\nshear and normal stresses and on the translational velocity distribution\nfunction is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 16:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

Earlier work suggests a\nmore rapid transformation of H$_2$ into stars in these objects but (1) a doubt\nremains about the validity of the H$_2$ mass estimates and (2) there is\ncurrently no explanation for why star formation should be more efficient. M~33,\na local group spiral with a mass $\\sim 10$\\% and a metallicity half that of the\nGalaxy, represents a first step towards the metal poor Dwarf Galaxies. We have\nsearched for molecular clouds in the outer disk of M~33 and present here a set\nof detections of both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, including the only detections\n(for both lines) beyond the R$_{25}$ radius in a subsolar metallicity galaxy.\nThe spatial resolution enables mass estimates for the clouds and thus a measure\nof the $N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO}$ ratio, which in turn enables a more reliable\ncalculation of the H$_2$ mass. Our estimate for the outer disk of M~33 is\n$N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO(1-0)} \\sim 5 \\times 10^{20} \\,{\\rm cm^{-2}/(K{\\rm \\\nkm \\ s^{-1}})}$ with an estimated uncertainty of a factor $\\le 2$. While the\n$^{12/13}$CO line ratios do not provide a reliable measure of $N({\\rm H}_2) /\nI_{\\rm CO}$, the values we find are slightly greater than Galactic and\ncorroborate a somewhat higher $N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO}$ value. Comparing the\nCO observations with other tracers of the interstellar medium, no reliable\nmeans of predicting where CO would be detected was identified. In particular,\nCO detections were often not directly on local HI or FIR or H$\\alpha$ peaks,\nalthough generally in regions with FIR emission and high HI column density. The\nresults presented here provide support for the quicker transformation of H$_2$\ninto stars in M~33 than in large local universe spirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}
