In\nparticular we investigate the exponential behavior of the solutions after a\nstandard hyperbolic scaling. This leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi variational\ninequality with an obstacle that depends on the solution itself and defines the\nopen set where the limiting solution does not vanish. Counter-examples show a\nnontrivial lack of uniqueness for the variational inequality depending on the\nconditions imposed on the boundary of this open set. Both Dirichlet and state\nconstraints boundary conditions play a role. When the competition term does not\nchange sign, we can identify the limit, while, in general, we find lower and\nupper bounds for the limit. Although models of this type are rather old and\nextinction phenomena are as important as blow-up, our motivation comes from the\nso-called \"tail problem\" in population biology. One way to avoid meaningless\nexponential tails, is to impose extra-mortality below a given survival\nthreshold.

Auslander, Reiten and Buchweitz\nhave used this periodicity to explain the existence of periodic projective\nresolutions over certain finite-dimensional algebras which arise as stable\nendomorphism rings of Cohen-Macaulay modules. These algebras are in fact\nperiodic, meaning that they have periodic projective resolutions as bimodules\nand thus periodic Hochschild cohomology as well. The goal of this article is to\ngeneralize this construction of periodic algebras to the context of Iyama's\nhigher AR-theory. We start by considering projective resolutions of functors on\na maximal (d-1)-orthogonal subcategory C of an exact Frobenius category B. If C\nis fixed by the d-th syzygy functor of B, then we show that this d-th syzygy\nfunctor induces the (2+d)-th syzygy on the category of finitely presented\nfunctors on the stable category of C. If C has finite type, i.e., if C = add(T)\nfor a d-cluster tilting object T, then we show that the stable endomorphism\nring of T has a quasi-periodic resolution over its enveloping algebra.\nMoreover, this resolution will be periodic if some higher syzygy functor is\nisomorphic to the identity on the stable category of C. It follows, in\nparticular, that 2-C.Y. tilted algebras arising as stable endomorphism rings of\nCohen-Macaulay modules over curve singularities, as in the work of Burban,\nIyama, Keller and Reiten have periodic bimodule resolutions of period 4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 16:57:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 19:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Typically, quiescent emission\nfrom these objects consists of thermal emission (presumably from the neutron\nstar surface) with an additional hard power-law tail of unknown nature.\nVariability has been observed during quiescence in Cen X-4 on both timescales\nas short as hundreds of seconds and as long as years. However, the nature of\nthis variability is still unknown. Early observations seemed to show it was all\ndue to a variable hard X-ray tail. Here, we present new and archival\nobservations that contradict this. The most recent Suzaku observation of Cen\nX-4 finds it in a historically low state, a factor of 4.4 fainter than the\nbrightest quiescent observation. As the spectrum during the brightest\nobservation was comprised of approximately 60% from the thermal component and\n40% from the power-law component, such a large change cannot be explained by\njust power-law variability. Spectral fits with a variable thermal component fit\nthe data well, while spectral fits allowing both the column density and the\npower-law to vary do not, leading to the conclusion that the thermal component\nmust be variable. Interestingly, we also find that the thermal fraction remains\nconsistent between all epochs, implying that the thermal and power-law fluxes\nvary by approximately the same amount. If the emitting area remains unchanged\nbetween observations, then the effective surface temperature must change.\nAlternatively, if the temperature remains constant, then the emitting area must\nchange. The nature of this thermal variability is unclear, but may be explained\nby variable low-level accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 18:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Using the epoch-folding method, we successfully detected\na pulsed period of 407.69(2) sec in the outburst of January and of 407.26(1)\nsec after the flare detection in March. We find that the spectral detection for\nthe source during outburst can be described by a blackbody model with a high\ntemperature (kT ~ 1-3 keV) and a small radius (R ~ 1 km), indicating that the\nemission results from the polar cap of the neutron star. On the other hand, the\nspectra obtained after the outburst can further be described by adding an\nadditional component with a lower temperature (kT ~ 0.1-0.2 keV) and a larger\nemission radius (R ~ 10-500 km), which indicates the emission from around the\ninner region of an accretion disk. We find that the thermal emission from the\nhot spot of the accreting neutron star dominates the radiation in outburst; the\nexistence of both this X-ray contribution and the additional soft component\nsuggest that the polar cap and the accretion disk emission might co-exist after\nthe outburst. Because the two-blackbody signature at the flaring stage is a\nunique feature of 1A 1118-615, our spectral results may provide a new insight\nto interpret the X-ray emission for the accreting neutron star.

Intervening OVI\nabsorbers are believed to trace shock-heated gas in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic\nMedium (WHIM) and may thus play a key role in the search for the missing\nbaryons in the present-day Universe. When compared to observations, the\npredicted distributions of the different OVI line parameters (column density,\nDoppler parameter, rest equivalent width) from our simulations exhibit a lack\nof strong OVI absorbers. This suggests that physical processes on sub-grid\nscales (e.g. turbulence) may strongly influence the observed properties of OVI\nsystems. We find that the intervening OVI absorption arises mainly in highly\nmetal-enriched (0.1 << Z/Z_sun < 1) gas at typical overdensities of 1 <<\nrho/<rho> < 100. One third of the OVI absorbers in our simulation are found to\ntrace gas at temperatures T < 10^5 K, while the rest arises in gas at higher\ntemperatures around T =10^5.3 K. The OVI resides in a similar region of\n(rho,T)-space as much of the shock-heated baryonic matter, but the vast\nmajority of this gas has a lower metal content and does not give rise to\ndetectable OVI absorption As a consequence of the patchy metal distribution,\nOVI absorbers in our simulations trace only a very small fraction of the cosmic\nbaryons (<2 percent) and the cosmic metals. Instead, these systems presumably\ntrace previously shock-heated, metal-rich material from galactic winds that is\nnow cooling. The common approach of comparing OVI and HI column densities to\nestimate the physical conditions in intervening absorbers from QSO observations\nmay be misleading, as most of the HI (and most of the gas mass) is not\nphysically connected with the high-metallicity patches that give rise to the\nOVI absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 19:20:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2010 17:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-29"}

The redshifts of seventy 4.6<z<5.6 LBGs\nwere identified. We find no significant difference in the frequency of high\nequivalent-width line emitters between z~3 and our z~5 samples. The rest-frame\nUV continuum slope of a typical z~5 line-emitting galaxy is bluer than that of\na typical break-only galaxy, a difference that is difficult to explain purely\nby differences in the ages of their stellar populations. Variation in\nmetallicity and/or dust extinction can more straightforwardly account for this\ndifference. Given their UV-continuum slopes, the typical z~5 LBGs have\nmetallicities a factor of three lower than those of LBGs at z~3. HST imaging\nindicates that a large majority of the spectroscopically-confirmed LBGs in our\nsample are members of multiple systems and/or show disturbed morphology. Using\nlocal LBG analogues as a model, this multiplicity could be explained either by\nsuper-starburst regions within a larger unseen structure, or by a high\nincidence of merging events at this epoch. The current data cannot distinguish\nbetween these two possibilities. The surface density of z~5 LBGs in two fields\nis considerably higher than in the rest. Both show clear spikes in their\nredshift distributions indicating strong three-dimensional clustering. Neither\nstructure can be bound given their depth in redshift and probably extend beyond\nthe observed fields. The three-dimensional distances between LBGs in the\nstructures are too large for them to have triggered their starbursts through\nmutual gravitational interaction, and so it is likely that the short-lived LBGs\nrepresent only a small fraction of the baryons in the structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This work focuses on the simultaneous modeling of the metabolic\ndegradation of pectin by Pel enzymes and the genetic regulation of pel genes by\n2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), a catabolite product of pectin which inactivates\nKdgR, one of the main repressors of pel genes. This modeling scheme takes into\naccount the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments:\nthe extracellular medium, where Pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and\nthe bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted\nto KDG. Using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of\nsome nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be\nestimated from the literature or from independent experiments. The few\nremaining unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations\nagainst a set of Pel activity data. Model predictions were verified by\nmeasuring the time courses of bacterial growth, Pel production, pel mRNA\naccumulation and pectin consumption under various growth conditions. This work\nreveals that pectin is almost totally consumed before the burst of Pel\nproduction. This paradoxical behaviour can be interpreted as an evolutionary\nstrategy to control the diffusion process so that as soon as a small amount of\npectin is detected by the bacteria in its surroundings it anticipates more\npectin to come. The model also predicts the possibility of bistable steady\nstates in the presence of constant pectin compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 20:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}

The character of the\nproximate magnetic phase is thus believed to be crucial for understanding the\ndifferences between the various families of unconventional superconductors and\nthe mechanism of superconductivity. Unlike the AFM order in cuprates, the\nnature of the magnetism and of the underlying electronic state in the iron\npnictide superconductors is not well understood. Neither density functional\ntheory nor models based on atomic physics and superexchange, account for the\nsmall size of the magnetic moment. Many low energy probes such as transport,\nSTM and ARPES measured strong anisotropy of the electronic states akin to the\nnematic order in a liquid crystal, but there is no consensus on its physical\norigin, and a three dimensional picture of electronic states and its relations\nto the optical conductivity in the magnetic state is lacking. Using a first\nprinciples approach, we obtained the experimentally observed magnetic moment,\noptical conductivity, and the anisotropy of the electronic states. The theory\nconnects ARPES, which measures one particle electronic states, optical\nspectroscopy, probing the particle hole excitations of the solid and neutron\nscattering which measures the magnetic moment. We predict a manifestation of\nthe anisotropy in the optical conductivity, and we show that the magnetic phase\narises from the paramagnetic phase by a large gain of the Hund's rule coupling\nenergy and a smaller loss of kinetic energy, indicating that iron pnictides\nrepresent a new class of compounds where the nature of magnetism is\nintermediate between the spin density wave of almost independent particles, and\nthe antiferromagnetic state of local moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 20:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

By investigating the\nthermodynamics of this latter model we identified the tricritical surface of\nthe U(3)_L x U(3)_R linear sigma model in the chiral limit. To apply the\nresults for QCD we used different scenarios for the m_s and \\mu_q dependence of\nthe effective model parameters, then the \\mu_q^TCP(m_s) function can be\ndetermined. Depending on the details, a curve bending upwards or downwards near\n\\mu_q=0 can be obtained, while with explicit chemical potential dependence of\nthe parameters the direction of the curve can change with m_s, too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 21:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-02"}

Comparing the WFs for the stripe\nantiferromagnetic order with those for no magnetic order, the difference is a\nsignificant spreading (``{\\it de}localization'') of specifically the $d_{xy}$\nand $d_{xz}$ (but not $d_{yz}$) WFs, where parallel Fe spins lie along the $x$\ndirection. The WF basis gives a tight-binding representation of the first\nprinciples, density functional based Fe-derived bands.

This change,\ncounterintuitively, actually reinforces electronic anisotropy. Further insight\nis gained by comparing the WFs of LaFeAsO and LaFePO, identifying how the\ndifference in WFs is related to the difference in hopping integrals and showing\nhow the pnictide atom is influential in forming the stripe antiferromagnetism.\nKinetic energy considerations suggest that orbital fluctuation, in addition to\nspin fluctuation, may contribute to the decrease in observed ordered moment\ncompared to the calculated values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 21:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}

These represent a scenario in which protoplanets\ngrow in a region of a circumstellar disk where water ice condenses (the \"ice\nline''), but fail to accrete massive gas envelopes before the gaseous disk is\ndispersed. Each simulation consists of a small number of gravitationally\ninteracting oligarchs and a much larger number of small bodies that represent\nthe natal disk of planetesimals. We investigate systems with varying initial\nnumber of oligarchs, oligarch spacing, location of the ice line, total mass in\nthe ice line, and oligarch mean density. Systems become chaotic in ~1 Myr but\nsettle into stable configurations in 10-100 Myr.

A natural\nquestion is: can we do any better provided that no further locality information\nimprovement can be made? This paper shows how the utility of locality\ninformation could be limited by conventional P2P data scheduling algorithms,\neven as sophisticated as the local rarest first policy.\n  Network coding's simplified data scheduling makes it competent for improving\nP2P application's throughput. Instead of only using locality information in the\ntopology construction, this paper proposes the locality-aware network coding\n(LANC) that uses locality information in both the topology construction and\ndownloading decision, and demonstrates its exceptional ability for P2P traffic\nlocalization. The randomization introduced by network coding enhances the\nchance for a peer to find innovative blocks in its neighborhood. Aided by\nproper locality-awareness, the probability for a peer to get innovative blocks\nfrom its proximity will increase as well, resulting in more efficient use of\nnetwork resources.

In the fractional regime above above nu\n=1/3 the system undergoes the metal-to-insulator transition, and in the\ninsulating phase the dispersion becomes linear with evidence of an increased\nrenormalized mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2010 15:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 12:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}
