We employ the slave-fermion representation of\nelectrons in which an electron is described as a composite of a charged\nspinless holon and a chargeless spinon. We introduce two kinds of U(1) gauge\nfields on links as auxiliary fields, one describing resonating valence bonds of\nantiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin pairs and the other for\nnearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes of holons and spinons in the ferromagnetic\nchannel. In order to perform numerical study of the system, we integrate out\nthe fermionic holon field by using the hopping expansion in powers of the\nhopping amplitude, which is legitimate for the region in and near the\ninsulating phase. The resultant effective model is described in terms of\nbosonic spinons and the two U(1) gauge fields, and a collective field for hole\npairs. We study this model by means of Monte-Carlo simulations, calculating the\nspecific heat, spin correlation functions, and instanton densities. We obtain a\nphase diagram in the hole concentration-temperature plane, which is in good\nagreement with that observed recently for clean and homogeneous underdoped\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 16:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-21"}

Firstly, the hydrodynamic flow\n(without the pollutants), modeled by Navier-Stokes and pressure equations, is\nnumerically resolved by the finite differences method, and associated with the\nfourth order Runge-Kutta procedure. After that, by using the hydrodynamic field\nvelocity, the flow of the reactive species (pollutants) is described through a\ntransport model, which considers advective and diffusive processes, as well as\nthrough a reactions model, restricted to the carbon-nitrogen cycle. The\ntransport and reactions model is numerically resolved by the stabilized finite\nelements method, by means of a semidiscrete formulation. A qualitative analysis\nof the numerical simulations conducted in function of the diffusion coefficient\nprovided better understanding of the dynamics of the processes involved in the\nflow of the reactive species, such as the dynamics of the nitrification\nprocess, of the biochemical requirement of oxygen and of the level of oxygen\ndissolved in the water body at Igap\\'o I Lake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 01:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

The method employs two finite-element\nmeshes, one in configuration space and one in action space. The DF is\nrepresented by its values at the nodes of the action-space mesh and by\ninterpolating functions inside the elements. The Galerkin projection of all\nequations that involve the DF leads to a linear system of equations, which can\nbe solved for the nodal values of the DF using linear or quadratic programming,\nor other optimization methods.

In this\npaper, we propose a BitTorrent-like protocol that replaces the peer selection\nmechanisms in the regular BitTorrent protocol with a novel reinforcement\nlearning (RL) based mechanism. Due to the inherent opration of P2P systems,\nwhich involves repeated interactions among peers over a long period of time,\nthe peers can efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirable\ncollaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers. Thus, it can\nhelp peers improve their download rates and discourage free-riding, while\nimproving fairness in the system. We model the peers' interactions in the\nBitTorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitly\nconsider the strategic behavior of the peers. A peer, which applies the\nRL-based mechanism, uses a partial history of the observations on associated\npeers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses and\nestimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. The policy\ndetermines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which would\nmaximize the peer's long-term performance, thereby making foresighted\ndecisions. We have implemented the proposed reinforcement-learning based\nmechanism and incorporated it into an existing BitTorrent client. We have\nperformed extensive experiments on a controlled Planetlab test bed. Our results\nconfirm that our proposed protocol (1) promotes fairness in terms of incentives\nto each peer's contribution e.g. high capacity peers improve their download\ncompletion time by up to 33\\%, (2) improves the system stability and robustness\ne.g. reducing the peer selection luctuations by 57\\%, and (3) discourages\nfree-riding e.g. peers reduce by 64\\% their upload to \\FR, in comparison to the\nregular \\BT~protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 06:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

The average\nformation lengths of several widely using species of baryons (antibaryons) such\nas $p$ ($\\bar{p}$), $n$ ($\\bar{n}$), $\\Delta$ ($\\bar{\\Delta}$), $\\Lambda$\n($\\bar{\\Lambda}$) and $\\Sigma$ ($\\bar{\\Sigma}$) are studied. It is shown that\nthey depend from electrical charges or, more precise, from quark contents of\nthe hadrons. In particular, the average formation lengths of positively charged\nhadrons, for example protons, are considerably larger than of their negatively\ncharged antiparticles, antiprotons. This statement is fulfilled for all nuclear\ntargets and any value of the Bjorken scaling variable $x_{Bj}$. The main\nmechanism is direct production. Additional production mechanism in result of\ndecay of resonances gives small contribution. It is shown that the average\nformation lengths of protons (antiprotons) are slowly rising (decreasing)\nfunctions of $x_{Bj}$, the ones of neutrons and antineutrons are slowly\ndecreasing functions of $x_{Bj}$. The shape and behavior of average formation\nlengths for baryons qualitatively coincide with the ones for pseudoscalar\nmesons obtained earlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 09:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-28"}

With this in mind, we\nhave conducted a high contrast imaging survey of mature AFGKM stars with the\nPALAO/PHARO instrument on the Palomar 200 inch telescope. The survey reached\nsensitivities sufficient to detect brown dwarf companions at separations of >\n50 AU. The results of this survey will be utilized both by future direct\nimaging projects such as GPI, SPHERE and P1640 and indirect detection missions\nsuch as SIM Lite. Out of 84 targets, all but one have no close-in (0.45-1\")\ncompanions and 64 (76%) have no stars at all within the 25\" field-of-view. The\nsensitivity contrasts in the Ks passband ranged from 4.5 to 10 for this set of\nobservations. These stars were selected as the best nearby targets for\nhabitable planet searches owing to their long-lived habitable zones (> 1\nbillion years). We report two stars, GJ 454 and GJ 1020, with previously\nunpublished proper motion companions. In both cases, the companions are stellar\nin nature and are most likely M dwarfs based on their absolute magnitudes and\ncolors. Based on our mass sensitivities and level of completeness, we can place\nan upper limit of ~17% on the presence of brown dwarf companions with masses\n>40 MJ at separations of 1 arcsecond. We also discuss the importance of\nincluding statistics on those stars with no detected companions in their field\nof view for the sake of future companion searches and an overall understanding\nof the population of low-mass objects around nearby stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 09:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The model is driven by a\nsurface map of the radial magnetic field constructed using Zeeman-Doppler\nImaging. We find that the global structure of the stellar corona is dominated\nby strong azimuthal tangling of the magnetic field due to the rapid rotation.\nThe MHD solution enables us to calculate realistic Alfv\\'en surfaces and we can\ntherefore estimate the stellar mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate\nwithout making undue theoretical simplifications. We consider three cases,\nparametrized by the base density of the corona, that span the range of possible\nsolutions for the system. We find that overall, the mass and angular-momentum\nloss rates are higher than in the solar case; the mass loss rates are 10 to 500\ntimes higher, and the angular momentum loss rate can be up to $3\\times{10}^4$\nhigher than present day solar values.
