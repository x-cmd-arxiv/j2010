To\nbetter understand the relation between these two kinds of survey, we construct\nan empirical cluster model using scaling relations constrained by current X-ray\nand SZ data. We apply our model to predict the X-ray properties of the Planck\nSZ Cluster Catalog (PCC) and compare them to existing X-ray cluster catalogs.\nWe find that Planck should significantly extend the depth of the previous\nall-sky cluster survey, performed in the early 1990s by the ROSAT satellite,\nand should be particularly effective at finding hot, massive clusters (T > 6\nkeV) out to redshift unity. These are rare objects, and our findings suggest\nthat Planck could increase the observational sample at z > 0.6 by an order of\nmagnitude. This would open the way for detailed studies of massive clusters out\nto these higher redshifts. Specifically, we find that the majority of\nnewly-detected Planck clusters should have X-ray fluxes 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm^2 <\nf_X[0.5-2 keV] < 10^{-12} ergs/s/cm^2, i.e., distributed over the decade in\nflux just below the ROSAT All Sky Survey limit.

Descriptive models based on a specific feature\nof the graph (clustering coefficient, degree distribution, etc.) have dominated\nconnectivity research in neuroscience.

We also provide a\nfoundation for the selection of important local features through the\nimplementation and assessment of three selection approaches: a traditional\np-value based backward selection approach, an information criterion approach\n(AIC), and a graphical goodness of fit (GOF) approach. The graphical GOF\napproach serves as the best method given the scientific interest in being able\nto capture and reproduce the structure of fitted brain networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 18:16:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2011 20:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

When u is a multiple-solitons solution, local special polynomials\nare localized in the vicinity of the soliton-collision region and fall off\nexponentially in all directions away from this region. Non-local ones are\nlocalized along soliton trajectories.\n  Examples are presented of how, with the aid of local special polynomials, one\ncan modify equations that have only a single-soliton solution into ones, which\nhave that solution as well as, at least, a two-solitons solutions.\n  Given an integrable equation, with the aid of local special polynomials, it\nis possible to find all evolution equations in higher scaling weights, which\nshare the same single-soliton solution and are either integrable, or, at least,\nhave a two-solitons solution. This is demonstrated for one or two consecutive\nscaling weights for a number of known equations.\n  In the study of perturbed integrable equations, local special polynomials are\nresponsible for inelastic soliton interactions generated by the perturbation in\nthe multiple-soliton case, and for the (possible) loss of asymptotic\nintegrability. Non-local special polynomials describe higher-order corrections\nto the solution, which are of an inelastic nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 18:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}

On the one hand, we propose\na new definition in order to compute the fractal dimension of a subset respect\nto any fractal structure, which completes the theory of classical box-counting\ndimension. Indeed, if we select the so called natural fractal structure on each\neuclidean space, then we will get the box-counting dimension as a particular\ncase. Recall that box-counting dimension could be calculated over any euclidean\nspace, although it can be defined over any metrizable one. Nevertheless, the\nnew definition we present can be computed on an easy way over any space\nadmitting a fractal structure. Thus, since a space is metrizable if and only if\nit supports a starbase fractal structure, our model allows to classify and\ndistinguish a much larger number of topological spaces than the classical\ndefinition. On the other hand, our aim consists also of studying some\napplications of effective calculation of the fractal dimension over a kind of\ncontexts where the box-counting dimension has no sense, like the domain of\nwords, which appears when modeling the streams of information in Kahn's\nparallel computation model. In this way, we show how to calculate and\nunderstand the fractal dimension value obtained for a language generated by\nmeans of a regular expression, and also we pay attention to an empirical and\nnovel application of fractal dimension to natural languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 18:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 18:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-23"}

In Paper III of this series, we showed that the thickness of\nthe FP is predominantly due to variations in the stellar mass surface density\n(Sigma_*) inside the effective radius R_e. These variations represent\ndifferences in the dark matter fraction inside R_e (or possibly differences in\nthe initial mass function) from galaxy to galaxy. This means that galaxies do\nnot wind up below the FP at lower surface brightness due to the passive fading\nof their stellar populations; they are structurally different. Here, we show\nthat these variations in Sigma_* at fixed dynamical mass (M_dyn) are linked to\ndifferences in the galaxy stellar populations, and therefore to differences in\ntheir star formation histories. We demonstrate that the ensemble of stellar\npopulation and Sigma_* variations through the FP thickness can be explained by\na model in which early-type galaxies at fixed M_dyn have their star formation\ntruncated at different times. The thickness of the FP can therefore be\ninterpreted as a sequence of truncation times. Galaxies below the FP have\nearlier truncation times for a given M_dyn, resulting in lower Sigma_*, older\nages, lower metallicities in both [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], and higher [Mg/Fe].

More luminous, larger and centrally located BCGs are located in\nmore massive and dominant galaxy clusters. These facts indicate that the host\ngalaxy cluster has played an important role in the formation of their BCGs. We\ndiscuss the possible mechanisms that can explain the observed evolution of the\nstructural parameters of the BCGs. We conclude that the main mechanisms that\ncan explain the increase in size and the non-evolution in the S\\'ersic shape\nparameter of the BCGs in the last 6 Gyr are feedback processes.

This result puts some theorems on deformation of\nmorphisms of curves and surfaces such as $K3$ and general type, obtained by ad\nhoc methods, in a new, more conceptual light. One of the main interests of our\nresult is to apply it to the construction of smooth varieties in projective\nspace with given invariants. We illustrate this by using our result to\nconstruct canonically embedded surfaces with $c_1^2=3p_g-7$ and derive some\ninteresting properties of their moduli spaces. Another interesting application\nof our result is the smoothing of ropes. We obtain a sufficient condition for a\nrope embedded in projective space to be smoothable. As a consequence, we prove\nthat canonically embedded carpets satisfying certain conditions can be\nsmoothed. We also give simple, unified proofs of known theorems on the\nsmoothing of $1$--dimensional ropes and $K3$ carpets. Our condition for\ndeforming $\\varphi$ to an embedding can be stated very transparently in terms\nof the cohomology class of a suitable first order infinitesimal deformation of\n$\\varphi$. It holds in a very general setting (any $X$ of arbitrary dimension\nand any $\\varphi$ unobstructed with an algebraic formally semiuniversal\ndeformation). The simplicity of the result can be seen for instance when we\nspecialize it to the case of curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 22:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-21"}

To be more precise, we employ a Bianchi-I\ngeometry (taken as an anisotropic perturbation of a flat FRW model) within two\ntypes of Born-Infeld theories. Firstly we consider pure Born-Infeld\nelectromagnetism. For either a constant or a $b(\\phi)$ coupling, inflationary\ntrajectories are modified but anisotropies increase; In particular, for the\nformer coupling we find that a quadratic inflaton potential, within a constant\nratio for the scalar and gauge energy densities, does not induce sufficient\ninflation, while in the latter the back-reaction in the cosmology determines\n(from the tensor-scalar ratio) a narrow range where inflation can occur. A\nDirac-Born-Infeld framework is afterwards analysed in both non-relativistic and\nrelativistic regimes. In the former, for different cases of the coupling\n(richer with respect to mere BI setups) between scalar and gauge sectors, we\nfind that inflationary trajectories are modified, with anisotropy increasing or\ndecreasing. In particular, a tachyonic solution is studied, allowing for a non\nstandard ratio between scalar and gauge matter densities, enhancing sufficient\ninflation, but with the anisotropy increasing. For the relativistic limit,\ninflationary trajectories are also modified and anisotropies increase faster\nthan in the non-relativistic limit. Finally we discuss how magnetic seed fields\ncould evolve in these settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 22:27:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 17:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-28"}

To achieve a high symbol rate, we first\npropose a scheme called DSTC-ICRec in which all sources' information streams\nare concurrently transmitted in both the source-relay link and the\nrelay-destination link. In this scheme, distributed space-time coding (DSTC) is\napplied at the relay, which satisfies the linear constraint. DSTC also allows\nthe destination to conduct the zero-forcing interference cancellation (IC)\nscheme originally proposed for multi-antenna systems to fully decouple signals\nfrom different sources. Our analysis shows that the symbol rate of DSTC-ICRec\nis $1/2$ symbols/source/channel use and the diversity gain of the scheme is\nupperbounded by $M-J+1$. To achieve a higher diversity gain, we propose another\nscheme called TDMA-ICRec in which the sources time-share the source-relay link.\nThe relay coherently combines the signals on its antennas to maximize the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each source, then concurrently forwards all\nsources' information.

It should be remarked that the original n-pole approximation\n(Phys.

It has\nbeen verified that the topology of the Fermi surface (defined by\n$A(\\omega=0,\\vec{k})$) is deeply affected by the doping, the strength of the\nCoulomb interaction and also by the hybridization. Particularly, in the\nunderdoped regime, the spectral function $A(\\omega=0,\\vec{k})$ presents very\nlow intensity close to the anti-nodal points $(0,\\pm \\pi)$ and $(\\pm \\pi,0)$.\nSuch a behavior produces an anomalous Fermi surface (pockets) with pseudogaps\nin the region of the anti-nodal points.

First, an average\nHamiltonian description of the DANTE pulse sequence is developed; such a\ndescription is determined to be valid either at or very far from the DANTE\nresonance frequencies, which are simply integer multiples of the inverse of the\ninterpulse delay. For aperiodic excitation schemes where the interpulse delays\nare chosen pseudorandomly, a single resonance can be selectively excited if the\n$\\theta$-pulses' phases are modulated in concert with the time delays. Such a\nselective pulse is termed a pseudorandom-DANTE or p-DANTE sequence, and the\nconditions in which an average Hamiltonian description of p-DANTE is found to\nbe similar to that found for the DANTE sequence. It is also shown that\naveraging over different p-DANTE sequences that are selective for the same\nresonance can help reduce excitations at frequencies away from the resonance\nfrequency, thereby improving the apparent selectivity of the p-DANTE sequences.\nFinally, experimental demonstrations of p-DANTE sequences and comparisons with\ntheory are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 04:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We have produced a new\ncode, ontario, to address gas emission from dusty gas-poor disks around A--F\nstars. This code computes the gas ionization and thermal balance\nself-consistently, with particular care taken of heating/cooling mechanisms.\nLine emission spectra are then produced for each species (up to zinc) by\nstatistical equilibrium calculations of the atomic/ionic energy levels. For\nparameters that resemble the observed beta Pictoris gas disk, we find that the\ngas is primarily heated by photoelectric emission from dust grains, and\nprimarily cooled through the CII 157.7 micron line emission. The gas can be\nheated to a temperature that is warmer than that of the dust and may in some\ncases reach temperature for thermal escape. The dominant cooling line, CII\n157.7 micron, should be detectable by Herschel in these disks, while the OI\n63.2 micron line will be too faint. We also study the dependence of the cooling\nline fluxes on a variety of disk parameters, in light of the much improved\nsensitivity to thermal line emission in the mid/far infrared and at\nsub-millimeter wavelengths provided by, in particular, Herschel, SOFIA and\nALMA.

In this paper we\nformulate a systematic examination of the variations in electron-phonon\ncoupling to oxygen phonons in the cuprates, incorporating a number of effects\narising from several aspects of chemical composition and doping across cuprate\nfamilies. It is argued that the electron-phonon coupling is a very sensitive\nprobe of the material-dependent variations of chemical structure, affecting the\norbital character of the band crossing the Fermi level, the strength of local\nelectric fields arising from structural-induced symmetry breaking, doping\ndependent changes in the underlying band structure, and ionicity of the crystal\ngoverning the ability of the material to screen $c$-axis perturbations. Using\nelectrostatic Ewald calculations and known experimental structural data, we\nestablish a connection between the material's maximal T$_c$ at optimal doping\nand the strength of coupling to $c$-axis modes. We demonstrate that materials\nwith the largest coupling to the out-of-phase bond-buckling (``$B_{1g}$\")\noxygen phonon branch also have the largest T$_c$'s. In light of this\nobservation we present model T$_c$ calculations using a two-well model where\nphonons work in conjunction with a dominant pairing interaction, presumably due\nto spin fluctuations, indicating how phonons can generate sizeable enhancements\nto T$_c$ despite the relatively small coupling strengths. Combined, these\nresults can provide a natural framework for understanding the doping and\nmaterial dependence of T$_c$ across the cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 15:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-23"}

Specifically, we\ninvestigate---through a comparison between calculated and low-temperature\nexperimental properties---whether the $5f$ electrons are localized or\ndelocalized in URu$_2$Si$_2$. We also performed dynamical mean field theory\ncalculations (LDA+DMFT) to investigate the temperature evolution of the\nquasi-particle states at 100~K and above, unveiling a progressive opening of a\nquasi-particle gap at the chemical potential when temperature is reduced. A\ndetailed comparison of calculated properties with known experimental data\ndemonstrates that the LSDA and GGA approaches, in which the uranium $5f$\nelectrons are treated as itinerant, provide an excellent explanation of the\navailable low-temperature experimental data of the PM and LMAF phases. We show\nfurthermore that due to a materials-specific Fermi surface instability a large,\nbut partial, Fermi surface gapping of up to 750 K occurs upon antiferromagnetic\nsymmetry breaking. The occurrence of the HO phase is explained through\ndynamical symmetry breaking induced by a mode of long-lived antiferromagnetic\nspin-fluctuations. This dynamical symmetry breaking model explains why the\nFermi surface gapping in the HO phase is similar but smaller than that in the\nLMAF phase and it also explains why the HO and LMAF phases have the same Fermi\nsurfaces yet different order parameters. Suitable derived order parameters for\nthe HO are proposed to be the Fermi surface gap or the dynamic spin-spin\ncorrelation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 15:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These data suggest that the physical\nproperties of the lipid bilayer influence ion channel activity likely via a\nfine tuning of its conformations. In a more general interpretative framework,\nwe suggest that other parameters such as pH, ionic strength, and the action of\namphiphilic drugs can affect the physical behavior of the lipid bilayer in a\nfashion similar to temperature changes resulting in functional changes of\ntransmembrane proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 15:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The method converges to exact eigenstates as the\nstatistical data collected increases if the wave function is sufficiently\nflexible. It is shown that the wave functions of complex anti-symmetric\neigen-states can be written as the product of an anti-symmetric real factor and\na symmetric phase factor. The dimensionality of the nodal surface is dependent\non whether phase is a scalar function or not. A recursive optimization\nalgorithm is derived from the time evolution of the mixed probability density,\nwhich is given by an ensemble of electronic configurations (walkers) with\ncomplex weight. This complex weight allows the amplitude of the fixed-node wave\nfunction to move away from the trial wave function phase. This novel approach\nis both a generalization of SHDMC and the fixed-phase approximation [Ortiz,\nCeperley and Martin, Phys Rev. Lett. {\\bf 71}, 2777 (1993)]. When used\nrecursively it simultaneously improves the node and the phase. The algorithm is\ndemonstrated to converge to nearly exact solutions of model systems with\nperiodic boundary conditions or applied magnetic fields. The computational cost\nis proportional to the number of independent degrees of freedom of the phase.\nThe method is applied to obtain low-energy excitations of Hamiltonians with\nmagnetic field or periodic boundary conditions. The method is used to optimize\nwave functions with twisted boundary conditions, which are included in a\nmany-body Bloch phase.
