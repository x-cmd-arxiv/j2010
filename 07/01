Circumscription has often been studied for first order\ntheories, but its propositional version has also been the subject of extensive\nresearch, having been shown equivalent to extended closed world assumption\n(ECWA). Moreover, entailment in propositional circumscription is a well-known\nexample of a decision problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.\nThis paper proposes a new Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)-based algorithm for\nentailment in propositional circumscription that explores the relationship of\npropositional circumscription to minimal models. The new algorithm is inspired\nby ideas commonly used in SAT-based model checking, namely counterexample\nguided abstraction refinement. In addition, the new algorithm is refined to\ncompute the theory closure for generalized close world assumption (GCWA).\nExperimental results show that the new algorithm can solve problem instances\nthat other solutions are unable to solve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 16:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01"}

The density of defects after the sweep\ncan be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are\nverified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the\nions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement.

This high redshift sub-DLA has a complex\nkinematic structure and harbours detections of neutral (SI, CI), singly (e.g.\nCII, SII) and multiply ionized (e.g. CIV, SiIV) species as well as molecular H\nand HD. The plethora of detected transitions in various ionization stages is\nindicative of a complex multi-phase structure present in this high redshift\ngalaxy. We demonstrate that the ionization corrections in this sub-DLA are\nsignificant (up to ~0.7 dex). For example, if no ionization correction is\napplied, a super-solar metallicity is derived ([S/H] = +0.36), whereas a single\nphase ionization correction reduces this to [S/H] = -0.19.

It is also found that the often used Coulomb logarithm\n$\\ln M/m$ has to be revised to best fit the merging time-scales from\nsimulation. Combining the analytical model with the Extended Press-Schechter\n(EPS) based merger trees, we study the subhalo mass function, and their spatial\ndistribution in a Milky-Way (MW) type halo. By tuning the tidal stripping\nefficiency, we can gain a better match to the subhalo mass function from\nsimulation. The predicted distribution of subhaloes is found to agree with the\ndistribution of MW satellites, but is more concentrated than the simulation\nresults. The radial distribution of subhaloes depends weakly on subhaloes mass\nat both present day and the time of accretion, but strongly on the accretion\ntime. Using the improved model, we measure the second moment of the subhalo\noccupation distribution, and it agrees well with the results of Kravtsov et al.\n(2004a) and Zheng et al. (2005).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 20:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

For sufficiently strong perpendicular\nflow shear, $M >1$, the propagation of the system characteristics is\nunidirectional and no unstable eigenmodes may form. Perturbations are swept\nalong the field, to be ultimately dissipated as they are sheared ever more\nstrongly. Numerical studies of the equations also reveal the existence of\nstable regions when $M < 1$, where the driving terms conflict. However, in both\ncases transitory perturbations exist, which could attain substantial amplitudes\nbefore decaying. Indeed, for $M \\gg 1$, they are shown to exponentiate\n$\\sqrt{M}$ times. This may provide a subcritical route to turbulence in\ntokamaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 22:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2010 12:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We detected the 13 clumps in H13CO+ line emission and\nobtained the physical parameters of the clumps with radii of 0.24-0.75pc,\nmasses of 100-1400Msun, and velocity widths in FWHM of 1.5-4.0kms^-1. The mean\ndensity is 3.9x10^4cm^-3 and the equivalent Jeans length is 0.13pc at 20K. We\nclassified the H13CO+ clumps into three types, Type A, B, and C according to\nthe relative locations of the H13CO+ clumps and the clusters. Our\nclassification represents an evolutionary trend of cluster-forming clumps\nbecause dense clumps are expected to be converted into stellar constituents, or\ndispersed by stellar activities. We found a similar but clearer trend than our\nprevious results for derived star formation efficiencies to increase from Type\nA to C in the H13CO+ data, and for the dense gas regions within the clumps\ntraced by H13CO+ to be sensitive to the physical evolution of clump-cluster\nsystems. In addition, we found that four out of 13 H13CO+ clumps which we named\nDVSOs(Distinct Velocity Structure Objects) have distinct velocity gradients at\nthe central parts of them. Assuming that the velocity gradients represent the\nrigid-like rotation of the clumps, we calculated the virial parameter of the\nH13CO+ clumps by taking into account the contribution of rotation, and found\nthat the DVSOs tend to be gravitationally unbound. In order to explain the\nabove physical properties for DVSOs, we propose a clump-clump collision model\nas a possible mechanism for triggering formation of clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 22:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By\ndramatically increasing the strength of atomic interactions, we suppress\ncollisional shifts in lattice sites containing $N$ > 1 atoms; strong\ninteractions introduce an energy splitting into the system, and evolution into\na many-particle state in which collisions occur is inhibited.

This result eliminates the compromise\nbetween precision and accuracy in a many-particle system, since both will\ncontinue to improve as the particle number increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 02:31:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 00:33:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2010 18:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Graphene,\nwith its potentially long spin-coherence length, is a promising material for\nspin-encoded information transport.

Results for both\ntwo mode condensates and the simpler single mode condensate case are presented.\nA hybrid phase space distribution functional method is used where the\ncondensate modes are described via a truncated Wigner representation, and the\nbasically unoccupied non-condensate modes are described via a positive P\nrepresentation. The Hamiltonian for the system is described in terms of quantum\nfield operators for the condensate and non-condensate modes. The functional\nFokker-Planck equation for the double phase space distribution functional is\nderived. Equivalent Ito stochastic equations for the condensate and\nnon-condensate fields that replace the field operators are obtained, and\nstochastic averages of products of these fields give the quantum correlation\nfunctions used to interpret interferometry experiments. The stochastic field\nequations are the sum of a deterministic term obtained from the drift vector in\nthe functional Fokker-Planck equation, and a noise field whose stochastic\nproperties are determined from the diffusion matrix in the functional\nFokker-Planck equation. The noise field stochastic properties are similar to\nthose for Gaussian-Markov processes in that the stochastic averages of odd\nnumbers of noise fields are zero and those for even numbers of noise field\nterms are sums of products of stochastic averages associated with pairs of\nnoise fields. However each pair is represented by an element of the diffusion\nmatrix rather than products of the noise fields themselves. The treatment\nstarts from a generalised mean field theory for two condensate mode. The\ngeneralized mean field theory solutions are needed for calculations using the\nIto stochastic field equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 08:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 01:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

An HCP consists of\nan infinite sequence of coalescence processes ${\\xi^{(n)}(\\cdot)}_{n\\ge1}$:\neach process occurs in a different \"epoch\" (indexed by $n$) and evolves for an\ninfinite time, while the evolution in subsequent epochs are linked in such a\nway that the initial distribution of $\\xi^{(n+1)}$ coincides with the final\ndistribution of $\\xi^{(n)}$. Inside each epoch the process, described by a\nsuitable simple point process representing the boundaries between adjacent\nintervals (domains), evolves as follows. Only intervals whose length belongs to\na certain epoch-dependent finite range are active, that is, they can\nincorporate their left or right neighboring interval with quite general rates.\nInactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their\nlength only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges\nare such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes\ninactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any\nmean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a\nrenewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all\nfuture epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for\nexample, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior\nas $n\\to \\infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates,\nactivity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the\nlimiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East\nmodel of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several\nsimulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the\nasymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear\nidentities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different\nepochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense\nlinearizes the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 09:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 05:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08"}

A large glitch happens in the pulsar whose rotation has\nunstable character. We present the results of the analysis of the rotation\nbehavior of this pulsar over the 30-year time span from 1979 to 2009. These\nresults show that the pulsar's rotation frequency underwent continuous, slow\noscillations which look like glitch-like events.

All the\nslow glitches observed have a similar signature related to a slow increase in\nthe rotation frequency during 200 days and the subsequent relaxation back to\nthe pre-glitch value during 400 days. We show that a continuous sequence of\nsuch slow glitches is characterized by practically identical amplitudes equal\nto Deltanu=3.5x10^{-9} Hz and identical time intervals between glitches of\nabout 600 days and is well described by a periodic sawtooth-like function.

Our\naim is to derive, from observational data, information on the present (10-15\nyrs after the outburst) nature and structure of the object. We present and\nanalyse a high-resolution (R = 21 000) spectrum of V4332 Sgr obtained with the\nSubaru Telescope in June 2009. Various components (stellar-like continuum,\natomic emission lines, molecular bands in emission) in the spectrum are\nanalysed and discussed. We also investigate a global spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the object mostly derived from broadband optical and\ninfrared photometry. The observed continuum resembles that of an M6 giant. The\nemission features (atomic and molecular) are most probably produced by\nradiative pumping. The observed strengths of the emission features strongly\nsuggest that we only observe a small part of the radiation of the main object\nresponsible for pumping the emission features. An infrared component seen in\nthe observed SED, which can be roughly approximated by two blackbodies of 950\nand 200 K, is 50 times brighter than the M6 stellar component seen in the\noptical. This further supports the idea that the main object is mostly obscured\nfor us. The main object in V4332 Sgr, an M6 (super)giant, is surrounded by a\ncircumstellar disc, which is seen almost edge-on so the central star is\nobscured. The observed M6 spectrum probably results from scattering the central\nstar spectrum on dust grains at the outer edge of the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 11:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 10:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The class of games\nconsidered provide a theoretical basis for decentralized resource allocation\nand control problems including network congestion control, wireless uplink\npower control, and optical power control.

The ``price of anarchy'' is shown not to be an\ninherent feature of full-information games that incorporate pricing mechanisms.\nMoreover, a simple linear pricing is shown to be sufficient for design of Nash\nequilibrium according to a chosen global objective for a fairly general class\nof games. Stability properties of the game and pricing dynamics are studied\nunder the assumption of time-scale separation and in two separate time-scales.\nThus, sufficient conditions are derived, which allow the designer to place the\nNash equilibrium solution or to guide the system trajectory to a desired region\nor point.

The\nestimated value of the upper critical field Hc2(0) is close to the calculated\nPauli limit, therefore further studies are needed to determine whether the\nabsence of an inversion center results in a significant admixture of the\ntriplet component of the order parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 13:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The temperature and density structure of the gas is\nvaried in order to differentiate between (i) simultaneous gas infall at a large\nrange of radii and (ii) the inside-out build-up of a disk. In all cases, the\ndisks go through phases of ring formation, gravitational instability and\nbreak-up into massive clumps. Ring formation can be enhanced by a focal point\neffect. The position of the ring is determined by the angular momentum\ndistribution of the material it forms from. We study the ring and clump\nmorphologies, the characteristic properties of the resulting velocity\ndispersion field and the effect of star formation. In the early phases, gas\naccretion leads to a high vertical velocity dispersion. We find that the disk\nfragmentation by gravitational instability and the subsequent clump-clump\ninteractions drive high velocity dispersions mainly in the plane of the disk\nwhile at the same time the vertical velocity dispersion dissipates. The result\nis a strong variation of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion with inclination\nangle. For a face-on view, clumps appear as minima in the (vertical)\ndispersion, whereas for a more edge-on view, they tend to correspond to maxima.\nThere exists observational evidence of a systematic variation of the velocity\ndispersion with inclination angle in high-redshift disks, which could be partly\nexplained by our simulation results. Additional energetic sources to drive\nvelocity dispersion that are not included in our models are also expected to\ncontribute to the observational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 13:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by\none or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by\ninverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,\nthe linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission\nmodels, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy\nintegral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes\nsignificantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to\napply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed\nelectrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve\nthe differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of\nthe electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution. Since any non-linear\ncooling will turn into linear cooling after some time, we also calculated the\nelectron number density for a combined cooling scenario consisting of both the\nlinear and non-linear cooling. For all cases, we will also calculate\nanalytically the emerging optically thin synchrotron fluence spectrum which\nwill be compared to a numerical solution. For small normalized frequencies f <\n1 the fluence spectra show constant spectral indices. We find for linear\ncooling a_SYN = 1/2, and for non-linear cooling a_SSC = 3/2. In the combined\ncooling scenario we obtain for the small injection parameter b_1 = 1/2, and for\nthe large injection parameter b_2 = 3/2, which becomes b_1 = 1/2 for very small\nfrequencies, again. This is the same behaviour as for monoenergetically\ninjected electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 14:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-17"}

We prove\nthat it converges exponentially rapidly in the number of samples used and\nexamine its numerical behavior on some test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 15:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

An investor needs to execute a long\nposition in the asset affecting the price of the asset and possibly incurring\nin fixed transaction cost. The objective is to maximize the discounted revenue\nobtained by this transaction. This problem is formulated first as an impulse\ncontrol problem and we characterize the value function using the viscosity\nsolutions framework. We also analyze the case where there is no transaction\ncost and how this formulation relates with a singular control problem. A\nviscosity solution characterization is provided in this case as well.

We choose the Flow-Oriented Routing protocol (FORP), the\ntraffic interference based Load Balancing Routing (LBR) protocol and Min-Max\nBattery Cost Routing (MMBCR) as representatives of the stability-based routing,\nload-balancing and power-aware routing protocols respectively. Among the three\nrouting protocols, FORP incurs the least number of route transitions; while LBR\nincurs the smallest hop count and lowest end-to-end delay per data packet.\nEnergy consumed per node is the least for MMBCR, closely followed by LBR. MMBCR\nis the most fair in terms of node usage and hence it incurs the largest time\nfor first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the stable\npath and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols and it incurs\nthe smallest value for the time of first node failure. As we measure the\nfailure times of up to the first five nodes in the network, we observe that LBR\nincurs the maximum improvement in the lifetime of the nodes and MMBCR incurs\nthe least improvement beyond the time of first node failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 09:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}
