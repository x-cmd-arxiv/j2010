For programs P and Q, the goal is to determine the answer sets\nthat correspond to the revision of P by Q, denoted P * Q. A fundamental\nprinciple of classical (AGM) revision, and the one that guides the approach\nhere, is the success postulate. In AGM revision, this stipulates that A is in K\n* A. By analogy with the success postulate, for programs P and Q, this means\nthat the answer sets of Q will in some sense be contained in those of P * Q.\nThe essential idea is that for P * Q, a three-valued answer set for Q,\nconsisting of positive and negative literals, is first determined. The positive\nliterals constitute a regular answer set, while the negated literals make up a\nminimal set of naf literals required to produce the answer set from Q. These\nliterals are propagated to the program P, along with those rules of Q that are\nnot decided by these literals. The approach differs from work in update logic\nprograms in two main respects. First, we ensure that the revising logic program\nhas higher priority, and so we satisfy the success postulate; second, for the\npreference implicit in a revision P * Q, the program Q as a whole takes\nprecedence over P, unlike update logic programs, since answer sets of Q are\npropagated to P. We show that a core group of the AGM postulates are satisfied,\nas are the postulates that have been proposed for update logic programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 16:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-29"}

A source has a data object which it can code\nand store over a set of storage nodes; it is allowed to store any amount of\ncoded data in each node, as long as the total amount of storage used does not\nexceed the given budget. A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the\noriginal data object by accessing each of the nodes independently with some\nconstant probability. By using an appropriate code, successful recovery occurs\nwhen the total amount of data in the accessed nodes is at least the size of the\noriginal data object. The goal is to find an optimal storage allocation that\nmaximizes the probability of successful recovery. This optimization problem is\nchallenging because of its discrete nature and nonconvexity, despite its simple\nformulation. Symmetric allocations (in which all nonempty nodes store the same\namount of data), though intuitive, may be suboptimal; the problem is nontrivial\neven if we optimize over only symmetric allocations. Our main result shows that\nthe symmetric allocation that spreads the budget maximally over all nodes is\nasymptotically optimal in a regime of interest.

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nand scanning tunneling spectroscopy have been performed on these islands to\nrecord current-voltage (I-V) curves. Because each island forms a double barrier\ntunnel junction (DBTJ) structure with the STM tip and the substrate, they would\nbe expected to exhibit single electron tunneling (SET) according to the\northodox model of SET. Some of the islands formed are small enough (diameter <\n10 nm) to exhibit SET at room temperature and evidence of SET has been\nidentified in some of the I-V curves recorded from these small islands.

However, most islands that were expected to\nexhibit SET did not do so, and the reasons for the absence of observable SET\nare evaluated. The most likely reasons for the absence of SET are determined to\nbe a wide depletion region in the substrate and Schottky barrier lowering due\nto Fermi level pinning by surface states of the clean silicon near the islands.\nThe results establish that although the Schottky barrier can act as an\neffective tunnel junction in a DBTJ structure, the islands may be unreliable in\nfuture nanoelectronic devices.

Conducting\natomic force microscopy has been performed on these islands to characterize and\nmeasure their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Current-voltage curves\nwere analyzed using thermionic emission theory to obtain the Schottky barrier\nheights and ideality factors between the silicide islands and the silicon\nsubstrates. Current-voltage measurements were performed ex situ for samples\n(\"passivated surfaces\") where the silicon surface surrounding the islands was\npassivated with a native oxide. Other samples (\"clean surfaces\") remained in\nUHV while I-V curves were recorded. By comparing barrier heights and ideality\nfactors for islands on both surfaces, the effects of the non-passivated\nsurfaces on conduction were studied. The clean surface barrier heights were\nfound to be ~0.2 to 0.3 eV below barrier heights measured from similar islands\non passivated surfaces. The reduced Schottky barrier is mainly attributed to\nFermi level pinning by non-passivated surface states of the clean silicon\nsurface. However, the measured barrier heights of the clean surface islands are\nequivalent on both Si(111) and Si(100), suggesting that the non-passivated\nsurfaces are influenced by cobalt impurities. Furthermore, the barrier heights\nof islands on the clean surfaces are lower than due to Fermi level pinning\nalone and the additional barrier height lowering is primarily attributed to\nspreading resistance effects. Schottky barrier inhomogeneity may also cause\nadditional barrier height lowering and non-ideality in the contacts. The clean\nsurface barrier heights decreased and the ideality factors increased with\ndecreasing temperature, which is attributed to the temperature variation of the\nFermi level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 19:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-29"}

We derive the visual extinction from reddening\ndetermined from 2MASS data. The comparison is done at an angular size of 200\",\ncorresponding to 0.14pc at a distance of 140pc. We find that the relation\nbetween visual extinction Av and N(CO) is linear between Av~3 and 10 mag in the\nregion associated with the B213--L1495 filament. In other regions the linear\nrelation is flattened for Av > 4 mag.

In traditional databases, a user\ndefined score function assigns a score value to each tuple and a top-$k$ query\nreturns $k$ tuples with the highest score. In uncertain database, top-$k$\nanswer depends not only on the scores but also on the membership probabilities\nof tuples. Several top-$k$ definitions covering different aspects of\nscore-probability interplay have been proposed in recent\npast~\\cite{R10,R4,R2,R8}. Most of the existing work in this research field is\nfocused on developing efficient algorithms for answering top-$k$ queries on\nstatic uncertain data. Any change (insertion, deletion of a tuple or change in\nmembership probability, score of a tuple) in underlying data forces\nre-computation of query answers. Such re-computations are not practical\nconsidering the dynamic nature of data in many applications. In this paper, we\npropose a fully dynamic data structure that uses ranking function\n$PRF^e(\\alpha)$ proposed by Li et al.~\\cite{R8} under the generally adopted\nmodel of $x$-relations~\\cite{R11}. $PRF^e$ can effectively approximate various\nother top-$k$ definitions on uncertain data based on the value of parameter\n$\\alpha$. An $x$-relation consists of a number of $x$-tuples, where $x$-tuple\nis a set of mutually exclusive tuples (up to a constant number) called\nalternatives. Each $x$-tuple in a relation randomly instantiates into one tuple\nfrom its alternatives. For an uncertain relation with $N$ tuples, our structure\ncan answer top-$k$ queries in $O(k\\log N)$ time, handles an update in $O(\\log\nN)$ time and takes $O(N)$ space.

In the classical stable marriage\nproblem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members\nof the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage\nproblems with quantitative preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a\nscore for each woman (resp., man).

The\nobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated models\nwith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall or\ninfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code RATRAN. The HCN line\nprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red with\nincreasing J and decreasing line opacity (HCN to H$^{13}$CN). This is most\nevident in the HCN 12--11 line at 1062 GHz. These line shapes are reproduced by\na model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansion\nin the inner part. The qualitative reproduction of the HCN lines suggests that\ninfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in the\nwarmer, inner regions.

We report results of an X-ray study of the supernova remnant (SNR)\nG344.7-0.1 and the point-like X-ray source located at the geometrical center of\nthe SNR radio structure. Methods. The morphology and spectral properties of the\nremnant and the central X-ray point-like source were studied using data from\nthe XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. Archival radio data and infrared Spitzer\nobservations at 8 and 24 $\\mu$m were used to compare and study its multi-band\nproperties at different wavelengths. Results. The XMM-Newton and Chandra\nobservations reveal that the overall X-ray emission of G344.7-0.1 is extended\nand correlates very well with regions of bright radio and infrared emission.\nThe X-ray spectrum is dominated by prominent atomic emission lines. These\ncharacteristics suggest that the X-ray emission originated in a thin thermal\nplasma, whose radiation is represented well by a plane-parallel shock plasma\nmodel (PSHOCK). Our study favors the scenario in which G344.7-0.1 is a 6 x 10^3\nyear old SNR expanding in a medium with a high density gradient and is most\nlikely encountering a molecular cloud on the western side. In addition, we\nreport the discovery of a soft point-like X-ray source located at the\ngeometrical center of the radio SNR structure. The object presents some\ncharacteristics of the so-called compact central objects (CCO). However, its\nneutral hydrogen absorption column (N_{H}) is inconsistent with that of the\nSNR. Coincident with the position of the source, we found infrared and optical\nobjects with typical early-K star characteristics. The X-ray source may be a\nforeground star or the CCO associated with the SNR. If this latter possibility\nwere confirmed, the point-like source would be the farthest CCO detected so far\nand the eighth member of the new population of isolated and weakly magnetized\nneutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 08:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A faint companion, called TMR-1C, located near the proto-star had\nbeen detected in previous studies, but its nature as a very young substellar\nobject remained inconclusive. To improve the constraints on the nature of\nTMR-1C, and to investigate the process of very low-mass star formation in the\nTMR-1 system we use very sensitive infrared imaging observations as well as NIR\nspectroscopy. We construct the SED of TMR-1C over a much larger wavelength\nrange as had been possible in previous work and compare it with models of\nextincted background stars, young sub-stellar objects, and very low-mass stars\nwith circumstellar disk and envelope emission.

From observations of\nfilament eruptions recorded with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager on STEREO\nduring 2008-2009, it is evident that these dimmings are much more pronounced in\n19.5 nm than in the lower-temperature line 17.1 nm, as viewed either on the\ndisk or above the limb. We conclude that most of the cooler coronal plasma is\nnot ejected but remains gravitationally bound when the loops open up. This\nresult is consistent with Doppler measurements by Imada and coworkers, who\nfound that the upflow speeds in a transient coronal hole increased dramatically\nabove a temperature of 1 MK; it is also consistent with the quasistatic\nbehavior of polar plumes, as compared with the hotter interplume regions that\nare the main source of the fast solar wind. When the open flux reconnects and\ncloses down again, the trapped plasma is initially heated to such high\ntemperatures that it is no longer visible at Fe IX 17.1 nm. Correspondingly,\n17.1 nm images show a dark ribbon or ``heat wave'' propagating away from the\npolarity inversion line and coinciding with the brightened Fe XV 28.4 nm and Fe\nXII 19.5 nm post-eruptive loops and their footpoint areas. Such dark ribbons\nprovide a clear example of dimmings that are not caused by a density depletion.\nThe propagation of the ``heat wave'' is driven by the closing-down, not the\nopening-up, of flux and can be observed both off-limb and on-disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 11:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

These models are live N-body models\nconsisting of equal mass particles, and they are steady state as confirmed by a\nfully self-consistent evolution. Our goals were twofold. The first one --\nnamely to test whether our iterative method could indeed be used to construct\ngalactic models following given observational constraints, both photometric and\nkinematic -- was fully achieved. Our method allowed us to go beyond a simple\nspherical model and to make full sets of rotating, axisymmetric models without\nany limitations to the velocity distribution. Our second goal was to understand\nbetter the structure of NGC 4494, and more specifically to set constraints on\nits halo mass. For this we tried three families of models: without halo, with a\nlight halo and with a heavy halo, respectively. Our models reproduce well the\nphotometry and the kinematics, the latter except specific regions where some\nnon-equilibrium or non-axisymmetric structure could be present in the galaxy\n(e.g. the kinematically decoupled core). However, the lower order moments of\nthe velocity distribution (up to and including the second order) do not allow\nus to discriminate between the three halos. On the other hand, when we extend\nthe comparison to the higher order moments of the velocity distribution\nobtained from the long-slit data, we find that our light halo model fits the\ndata better than the no halo, or the heavy halo models. They also reproduce the\nshape of the angular dependence of the PNe velocity dispersion in the outermost\nparts of the galaxy, but not the amplitude of its azimuthal variation. This may\nimply that a yet more general class of models, such as triaxial, may be\nnecessary for a yet better fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 12:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

All these galaxy\nclusters are characterized by high temperatures. We obtained detailed RM images\nat an angular resolution of 3'' for most of the observed radio galaxies. The RM\nimages are patchy and reveal fine substructures of a few kpc in size. Under the\nassumption that the radio galaxies themselves have no effect on the measured\nRMs, these structures indicate that the intracluster magnetic fields fluctuate\ndown to such small scales. These new data are compared with RM information\npresent in the literature for cooler galaxy clusters. For a fixed projected\ndistance from the cluster center, clusters with higher temperature show a\nhigher dispersion of the RM distributions (sigmaRM), mostly because of the\nhigher gas density in these clusters. Although the previously known relation\nbetween the clusters X-ray surface brightness (Sx) at the radio galaxy location\nand sigmaRM is confirmed, a possible connection between the sigmaRM-Sx relation\nand the cluster temperature, if present, is very weak.

The system-state probability distribution of CSMA wireless\nnetworks is a Markov random field. An interesting question is how BP can help\nthe analysis and design of CSMA wireless networks. This paper explores three\nsuch applications. First, we show how BP can be used to compute the throughputs\nof different links in the network given their access intensities, defined as\nthe mean packet transmission time divided by the mean backoff countdown time.\nSecond, we propose an inverse-BP algorithm to solve the reverse problem: how to\nset the access intensities of different links to meet their target throughputs?\nThird, we introduce a BP-adaptive CSMA algorithm to find the link access\nintensities that can achieve optimal system utility. BP solves the three\nproblems with exact results in tree networks. It may, however, lose accuracy in\nnetworks with a loopy contention graph. We show how a generalized version of\nBP, GBP, can be designed to solve the three problems with high accuracy for\nnetworks with a loopy contention graph.

Of particular interest is the fact that the adaptive CSMA\ncan achieve a system utility arbitrarily close to that is achievable under a\ncentral scheduler. However, a specially designed transport-layer rate\ncontroller is needed for this result. An outstanding question is whether the\nwidely-installed TCP Reno is compatible with adaptive CSMA and can achieve the\nsame result. The answer to this question will determine how close to practical\ndeployment adaptive CSMA is. Our answer is yes and no. First, we observe that\nrunning TCP Reno directly over adaptive CSMA results in severe starvation\nproblems. Effectively, its performance is no better than that of TCP Reno over\nlegacy CSMA (IEEE 802.11), and the potentials of adaptive CSMA cannot be\nrealized. Fortunately, we find that multi-connection TCP Reno over adaptive\nCSMA with active queue management can materialize the advantages of adaptive\nCSMA. NS-2 simulations demonstrate that our solution can alleviate starvation\nand achieve fair and efficient rate allocation. Multi-connection TCP can be\nimplemented at either application or transport layer.

A slightly milder truncation of the Borcherds superalgebra\nenables one to predict also the \"spectrum\" of the non-dynamical $(D - 1)$ and\n$D$-forms. The maximal supergravity $p$-form spectra were reanalyzed more\nrecently by truncation of the field spectrum of $E_{11}$ to the $p$-forms that\nare relevant after reduction from 11 to $D$ dimensions. We show in this paper\nhow the Borcherds description can be systematically derived from the split\n(\"maximally non compact\") real form of $E_{11}$ for $D \\geq 1.$ This explains\nnot only why both structures lead to the same propagating $p$-forms and their\nduals for $p\\leq (D - 2),$ but also why one obtains the same $(D - 1)$-forms\nand \"top\" $D$-forms.

We find that the Hubble\nparameter evolves more slowly in non-minimal coupling case as compared to the\nminimal coupling case. In both the cases, the universe accelerates around\npresent time, and enters the decelerating regime in the past. Using the latest\nUnion2 dataset for supernova Type Ia observations as well as the data for\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from SDSS observations, we constraint the\nparameters of Linder exponential model in the two different approaches.

One possibility is a fully\npaired state with a gap for fermion excitations in which the Cooper pairs\nremain uncondensed. Such a \"Cooper-pair Bose-metal\" phase would be expected to\nhave a singular Bose-surface in momentum space. As demonstrated in the context\nof 2D bosons hopping with a frustrating ring-exchange interaction, an analogous\nBose-metal phase has a set of quasi-1D descendent states when put on a ladder\ngeometry. Here we present a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study\nof the attractive Hubbard model with spin-dependent hopping on a two-leg ladder\ngeometry. In our setup, one spin species moves preferentially along the leg\ndirection, while the other does so along the rung direction. We find compelling\nevidence for the existence of a novel Cooper-pair Bose-metal phase in a region\nof the phase diagram at intermediate coupling. We further explore the phase\ndiagram of this model as a function of hopping anisotropy, density, and\ninteraction strength, finding a conventional superfluid phase, as well as a\nphase of paired Cooper pairs with d-wave symmetry, similar to the one found in\nmodels of hard-core bosons with ring-exchange. We argue that simulating this\nmodel with cold Fermi gases on spin dependent optical lattices is a promising\ndirection for realizing exotic quantum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 15:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-27"}

It is shown that for a method to have global saturation the total\nerror must be optimal in two senses, namely as optimal order of convergence\nover a certain set which at the same time, must be optimal (in a very precise\nsense) with respect to the error. Finally, two converse results are proved and\nthe theory is applied to find sufficient conditions which ensure the existence\nof global saturation for spectral methods with classical qualification of\nfinite positive order and for methods with maximal qualification.

Generally, the phonon scattering with substrates can\ndecrease the thermal conductivity, as observed in recent experiments. However,\nwe find that at certain regions, the coupling to substrates can increase the\nthermal conductivity due to a reduction of anharmonic phonon scattering induced\nby shift of the phonon band to the low wave vector. In this way, the thermal\nconductivity can be efficiently manipulated via coupling to different\nsubstrates, without changing or destroying the material structures. This idea\nis demonstrated by calculating the thermal conductivity of modified\ndouble-walled carbon nanotubes and also by the ice nanotubes coupled within\ncarbon nanotubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 10:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
