One approach for controlling the\ndiscrete divergence is through a so-called constrained transport method, which\nis based on first predicting a magnetic field through a standard finite volume\nsolver, and then correcting this field through the appropriate use of a\nmagnetic vector potential. In this work we develop a constrained transport\nmethod for the 3D ideal MHD equations that is based on a high-resolution wave\npropagation scheme. Our proposed scheme is the 3D extension of the 2D scheme\ndeveloped by Rossmanith [SIAM J. Sci. Comp. 28, 1766 (2006)], and is based on\nthe high-resolution wave propagation method of Langseth and LeVeque [J. Comp.\nPhys. 165, 126 (2000)]. In particular, in our extension we take great care to\nmaintain the three most important properties of the 2D scheme: (1) all\nquantities, including all components of the magnetic field and magnetic\npotential, are treated as cell-centered; (2) we develop a high-resolution wave\npropagation scheme for evolving the magnetic potential; and (3) we develop a\nwave limiting approach that is applied during the vector potential evolution,\nwhich controls unphysical oscillations in the magnetic field. One of the key\nnumerical difficulties that is novel to 3D is that the transport equation that\nmust be solved for the magnetic vector potential is only weakly hyperbolic. In\npresenting our numerical algorithm we describe how to numerically handle this\nproblem of weak hyperbolicity, as well as how to choose an appropriate gauge\ncondition. The resulting scheme is applied to several numerical test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 16:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2011 21:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Given that the events\nare fixed in time, that the sources are occulted randomly, and that the\ntelescope use is minimal, the technique is very well suited for service mode\nobservations. We have established a program of routine LO observations at the\nVLT observatory, especially designed to take advantage of short breaks\navailable in-between other programs. We have used the ISAAC instrument in burst\nmode, capable of producing continuous read-outs at millisecond rates on a\nsuitable subwindow.

We have recorded the signal from background stars for a few\nseconds, around the predicted time of occultation by the Moon's dark limb. At\nmillisecond time resolution, a characteristic diffraction pattern can be\nobserved. Patterns for two or more sources superimpose linearly, and this\nproperty is used for the detection of binary stars. The detailed analysis of\nthe diffraction fringes can be used to measure specific properties such as the\nstellar angular size and the presence of extended light sources such as a\ncircumstellar shell.

A particular gauge-invariant observable\nquantity is computed as a function of the binary's orbital frequency. The\nconservative effect induced by the gravitational SF is obtained numerically\nwith high precision, and compared to the PN prediction developed to high order.\nThe PN calculation involves the computation of the 3PN regularized metric at\nthe location of the particle. Its divergent self-field is regularized by means\nof dimensional regularization. The poles proportional to 1/(d-3) which occur\nwithin dimensional regularization at the 3PN order disappear from the final\ngauge-invariant result. The leading 4PN and next-to-leading 5PN conservative\nlogarithmic contributions originating from gravitational-wave tails are also\nobtained. Making use of these exact PN results, some previously unknown PN\ncoefficients are measured up to the very high 7PN order by fitting to the\nnumerical self-force data. Using just the 2PN and new logarithmic terms, the\nvalue of the 3PN coefficient is also confirmed numerically with very high\nprecision. The consistency of this cross-cultural comparison provides a crucial\ntest of the very different regularization methods used in both SF and PN\nformalisms, and illustrates the complementarity of these approximation schemes\nwhen modelling compact binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 16:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By taking advantage of a\ntruly panoramic coverage, from the field to a rich cluster, it is shown that\nboth mass and environment play crucial roles in determining the properties of\nSF galaxies. The median specific SFR declines with mass in all environments,\nand the fraction of galaxies forming stars declines from ~40%, for M~10^10M_sun\nto effectively zero at M>10^11.5M_sun, confirming that mass-downsizing is\ngenerally in place by z~1. The fraction of SF galaxies also falls as a function\nof local environmental density from ~40% in the field to approaching zero at\nrich group/cluster densities. When SF does occur in high density regions, it is\nmerger-dominated and, if only non-merging SF galaxies are considered, then the\nenvironment and mass trends are even stronger and largely independent, as in\nthe local Universe. The median SFR of SF galaxies is found to increase with\ndensity up to intermediate (group or cluster outskirts) densities; this is\nclearly seen as a change in the faint-end slope of the H-alpha LF from steep\n(-1.9), in poor fields, to shallow (-1.1) in groups and clusters.\nInterestingly, the relation between median SFR and environment is only found\nfor low to moderate-mass galaxies (below ~10^10.6M_sun), and is not seen for\nmassive SF galaxies. Overall, these observations provide a detailed view over a\nsufficiently large range of mass and environment to reconcile previous\nobservational claims: mass is the primary predictor of SF activity at z~1, but\nthe environment, while enhancing the median SFR of (lower-mass) SF galaxies, is\nultimately responsible for suppressing SF activity in all galaxies above\nsurface densities of 10-30 Mpc^-2 (groups and clusters).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Of the 934\ngamma-ray sources at high Galactic latitude (|b| > 15 degrees) in the First\nFermi-LAT catalogue (1FGL), 316 have no obvious associations at other\nwavelengths.

Although such estimate leaves some room for\nnovel discoveries, it severely restricts the possibility of detecting dark\nmatter subhaloes and other unconventional types of gamma-ray emitters in the\n1FGL.

Both analytic calculations\nand simulations argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produces\norbit crossings and shocks in the gas.

White dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage of the vast\nmajority of stars, including our Sun. The study of white dwarfs has potential\napplications to different fields of astrophysics. In particular, they can be\nused as independent reliable cosmic clocks, and can also provide valuable\ninformation about the fundamental parameters of a wide variety of stellar\npopulations, like our Galaxy and open and globular clusters. In addition, the\nhigh densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow to use these\nstars as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme\nconditions that cannot be achieved in terrestrial laboratories. They can be\nused to constrain fundamental properties of elementary particles such as axions\nand neutrinos, and to study problems related to the variation of fundamental\nconstants.\n  In this work, we review the essentials of the physics of white dwarf stars.\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the physical processes that lead to the formation\nof white dwarfs as well as on the different energy sources and processes\nresponsible for chemical abundance changes that occur along their evolution.\nMoreover, in the course of their lives, white dwarfs cross different\npulsational instability strips.

Various limits of supersymmetry breaking are\nexamined. We find that when supersymmetry is broken on the UV brane, vacuum\ncontributions to the radion potential can be controlled (as likely necessary\nfor EWSB to govern the radion potential) via small soft masses as well as a\n\"double volume suppression.\" Our formalism can also provide a setup for radion\nstabilization by bulk fields, when supersymmetry is broken on both the UV and\nthe IR branes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 22:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2010 20:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-08"}

Accurate stellar\nabundances require the determinations of reliable physical parameters, namely\nthe effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity, and\nmetallicity. This work presents the homogeneous derivation of such parameters\nfor a large sample of stars hosting planets (N=117), as well as a control\nsample of disk stars not known to harbor giant, closely orbiting planets\n(N=145). Stellar parameters and iron abundances are derived from an automated\nanalysis technique developed for this work.

A segregation of the sample according to\nplanet mass indicates that the metallicity distribution of stars hosting only\nNeptunian-mass planets (with no Jovian-mass planets) tends to be more\nmetal-poor in comparison with that obtained for stars hosting a closely\norbiting Jovian planet. The significance of this difference in metallicity\narises from a homogeneous analysis of samples of FGK dwarfs which do not\ninclude the cooler and more problematic M dwarfs. This result would indicate\nthat there is a possible link between planet mass and metallicity such that\nmetallicity plays a role in setting the mass of the most massive planet.\nFurther confirmation, however, must await larger samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 23:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-23"}

In this paper we evaluate the performance of ViLLaGEs in open- and\nclosed-loop control, finding that both control methods give equivalent Strehl\nratios of up to ~ 7% in I-band and similar rejection of temporal power.\nTherefore, we find that open-loop control of MEMS on-sky is as effective as\nclosed-loop control. Furthermore, after operating the system for three years,\nwe find MEMS technology to function well in the observatory environment. We\nconstruct an error budget for the system, accounting for 130 nm of wavefront\nerror out of 190 nm error in the science-camera PSFs. We find that the dominant\nknown term is internal static error, and that the known contributions to the\nerror budget from open-loop control (MEMS model, position repeatability,\nhysteresis, and WFS linearity) are negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 03:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

One way to study such a distributed system is by\ndefining games, which involve selfish nodes that make strategic choices on\nreplicating content in their local limited memory (cache) or accessing content\nfrom other nodes for a cost. These Selfish Replication games have been\nintroduced in [8] for nodes that do not have any capacity limits, leaving the\ncapacitated problem, i.e. Capacitated Selfish Replication (CSR) games, open.\n  In this work, we first form the model of the CSR games, for which we perform\na Nash equilibria analysis. In particular, we focus on hierarchical networks,\ngiven their extensive use to model communication costs of content delivery in\nP2P systems. We present an exact polynomial-time algorithm for any hierarchical\nnetwork, under two constraints on the utility functions: 1) \"Nearer is better\",\ni.e. the closest the content is to the node the less its access cost is, and 2)\n\"Independence of irrelevant alternatives\", i.e. aggregation of individual node\npreferences. This generalization represents a vast class of utilities and more\ninterestingly allows each of the nodes to have simultaneously completely\ndifferent functional forms of utility functions. In this general framework, we\npresent CSR games results on arbitrary networks and outline the boundary\nbetween intractability and effective computability in terms of the network\nstructure, object preferences, and the total number of objects. Moreover, we\nprove that the problem of equilibria existence becomes NP-hard for general CSR\ngames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 04:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2011 18:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2011 01:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 10:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

The dissipative mechanical systems discussed in this paper are finite\ndimensional.This approach is based upon a proposition: for any nonconservative\nclassical mechanical system and any initial condition, there exists a\nconservative one; the two systems share one and only one common phase curve;\nthe Hamiltonian of the conservative system is the sum of the total energy of\nthe nonconservative system on the aforementioned phase curve and a constant\ndepending on the initial condition. Hence, this approach entails substituting\nan infinite number of conservative systems for a dissipative mechanical system\ncorresponding to varied initial conditions. Therefore, first we utilize the\ntime-centered difference scheme directly to solve the original system, after\nwhich we substitute the numerical solution for the analytical solution to\nconstruct a conservative force equal to the dissipative force on the phase\ncurve, such that we would obtain a substituting conservative system\nnumerically. Finally, we use the time-centered scheme to integrate the\nsubstituting system numerically. We will find an interesting fact that the\nlatter solution resulting from the substituting system is equivalent to that of\nthe former. Indeed, there are two transition matrices within time grid points:\nthe first one is unsymplectic and the second symplectic.

Using the \"single-letter\"\nformula proved independently by Holevo and by Schumacher and Westmoreland we\nobtain the product-state capacity of the qubit quantum amplitude-damping\nchannel, which is determined by a transcendental equation in a single real\nvariable and can be solved numerically. We demonstrate that the product-state\ncapacity of this channel can be achieved using a minimal ensemble of\nnon-orthogonal pure states.

A solution to this problem is relevant for several\ntasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock\nsynchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we\nallow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the\nnominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable\ninputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and\nidentification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We\nconsider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding)\nand malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that\nallow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining\nundetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we\nprovide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious\nagents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network\nneeds to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to\nbe generically detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third,\nwe quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value.\nFourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents.\nThe first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and\naffords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the\nnetwork is available to each agent, at a high computational cost.

This report proposes to make use of a cascade\nself-seeding scheme with wake monochromators in a tunable-gap baseline\nundulator at the European XFEL to create a source capable of delivering\ncoherent radiation of unprecedented characteristics at hard X-ray wavelengths.\nCompared with SASE X-ray FEL parameters, the radiation from the new source has\nthree truly unique aspects: complete longitudinal and transverse coherence, and\na peak brightness three orders of magnitude higher than what is presently\navailable at LCLS.

The focus is on decoding\ninformation on wind clumping from measurements of ratios of the radial optical\ndepths (tau_(rad)(w)) of the red and blue components of the SiIV doublet.

We also discuss\nposet-upper-triangularity, a key combinatorial notion in both GKM theory and\nmore generally in localization theory in equivariant cohomology. With a view\ntoward other applications, we present parts of our setup in a general algebraic\nand combinatorial framework. Second, motivated by our central problem of\nbuilding module bases, we introduce a combinatorial game which we dub poset\npinball and illustrate with several examples. Finally, as first applications,\nwe apply the perspective of GKM-compatible subspaces and poset pinball to\nconstruct explicit and computationally convenient module bases for the\n$S^1$-equivariant cohomology of all Peterson varieties of classical Lie type,\nand subregular Springer varieties of Lie type $A$. In addition, in the Springer\ncase we use our module basis to lift the classical Springer representation on\nthe ordinary cohomology of subregular Springer varieties to $S^1$-equivariant\ncohomology in Lie type $A$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 11:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-19"}

Considering the blazars detected in both\nbands, the correlation is highly significant and it is F_g~F_r^0.85+-0.04,\nsimilar for BL Lac and FSRQ sources. However, only a small fraction (~1/15) of\nthe AT20G radio sources with flat radio spectrum, are detected by Fermi. To\nunderstand if this correlation is real, we examine the selection effects\nintroduced by the flux limits of the radio and gamma-ray surveys, and the\nimportance of variability of the gamma-ray flux. We find that the\nradio/gamma-ray flux correlation is real, but its slope is steeper than the\nobserved one, i.e. F_g~F_r^delta with delta in the range 1.25-1.5. The observed\nF_g-F_r correlation and the fraction of radio sources detected by Fermi is\nreproduced assuming a long term gamma-ray flux variability following a\nlog-normal probability distribution with standard deviation sigma>0.5\n(corresponding to F_g varying by at least a factor 3). Such a variability is\ncompatible with what observed when comparing, for the sources in common, the\nEGRET and the Fermi gamma-ray fluxes (even if the Fermi fluxes are averaged\nover ~1 year). Another indication of variability is the non detection of 12 out\nof 66 EGRET blazars by Fermi, despite its higher sensitivity.We also study the\nstrong linear correlation between the gamma-ray and the radio luminosity of the\n144 AT20G-Fermi associations with known redshift and show that it is\nstatistically robust. Two possible implications of these correlations are\ndiscussed: the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground and the prediction of blazars that might undergo extremely high\nstates of gamma-ray emission in the next years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2010 12:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2010 12:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We apply the code to simulate the\nsurface granulation in a solar-type star, ignoring magnetic fields, and\ninvestigate the importance of coherent scattering for the atmospheric\nstructure.

This is crucial in\nunderstanding the correct spatial variation of physical properties in the\npenumbral atmosphere and to provide insights into the mechanism capable of\nexplaining the observed penumbral brightness. The aim of this work is to\ndetermine a global geometrical height scale in the penumbra by minimizing the\ndivergence of the magnetic field vector and the deviations from static\nequilibrium as imposed by a force balance equation that includes pressure\ngradients, gravity and the Lorentz force. Optical depth models are derived from\nthe SIR inversion of spectropolarimetric data of an active region observed with\nSOT on-board the Hinode satellite.
