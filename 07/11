In this paper we study the indirect detection\nsignatures of gravitino dark matter including such final states. First, we\nobtain the gamma ray spectrum from gravitino decays, which features a\nmonochromatic contribution from the decay into photon+neutrino and a continuum\ncontribution from the three-body decays. After studying its dependence on\nsupersymmetric parameters, we compute the expected gamma ray fluxes and derive\nnew constraints, from recent FERMI data, on the R-parity breaking parameter and\non the gravitino lifetime. Indirect detection via antimatter searches, a new\npossibility brought about by the three-body final states, is also analyzed. For\nmodels compatible with the gamma ray observations, the positron signal is found\nto be negligible whereas the antiproton one can be significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2010 16:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2011 11:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-01"}

We have obtained 16 new mid-eclipse time measurements of this source\nduring the last 13 years using X- ray observations made with the RXTE-PCA,\nRXTE-ASM, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories. These, along with\nthe earlier known mid-eclipse times have been used to accurately determine the\ntimescale for a change in the orbital period of 4U 1822-37.

To perform the astrometric measurement with\nsuch a high accuracy, the differential path length through the VLTI and the\ninstrument has to be measured (and tracked since Earth's rotation will\npermanently change it) by a laser metrology to an even higher level of accuracy\n(corresponding to 1 nm in 3 minutes).

In this paper, a paradigm shift is proposed whereby a\ncommittee of classifiers is used to determine the final classification output.\nTwo of the key components of an ensemble system are that there should be\ndiversity among the classifiers and that there should be a mechanism through\nwhich the results are combined. In this paper, the members of the ensemble\nsystem include: Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM and Quadratic SVM. The final output\nwas determined through a simple majority vote of the individual classifiers.\nFrom the results obtained it was observed that the final derived map generated\nby an ensemble system can potentially improve on the results derived from the\nindividual classifiers making up the ensemble system. The ensemble system\nclassification accuracy was, in this case, better than the linear and quadratic\nSVM result. It was however less than that of the RBF SVM.
