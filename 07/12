In this order of limits the light\ncone of the path integral disappears, giving rise to an instantaneous spread of\nthe wave function to the entire space. We ascribe the failure of Schroedinger's\nequation to retain the light cone of the path integral to the very nature of\nthe limiting process: it is a regular expansion of a singular approximation\nproblem, because the boundary conditions of the path integral on the light cone\nare lost in this limit. We propose a distinguished limit, which produces an\nintermediate model between non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics:\nit produces Schroedinger's equation and preserves the zero boundary conditions\non and outside the original light cone of the path integral. These boundary\nconditions relieve the Schroedinger equation of several annoying, seemingly\nunrelated unphysical artifacts, including non-analytic wave functions,\nspontaneous appearance of discontinuities, non-existence of moments when the\ninitial wave function has a jump discontinuity (e.g., a collapsed wave function\nafter a measurement), the EPR paradox, and so on. The practical implications of\nthe present formulation are yet to be seen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2010 16:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-13"}

The subsystem can also be adapted to GPS L1 (1575.42 MHz), L2C\n(1227.6 MHz), and others. A follow-up is underway to develop a prototype to\ndeploy and evaluate at NAIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2010 20:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 14:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-26"}

The analysis of the X-ray emission from groups and clusters allows to\nstudy the large scale structure of the Universe, to constrain the cosmological\nparameters, and to investigate the interaction between the ICM and the cluster\ngalaxies. My scientific work is mainly focused on the realization of a new\nX-ray survey of galaxy clusters, the SXCS, obtained from the previously\nunexplored archive of the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board of the Swift\nsatellite. The goal is not only to build a new catalogue, but also to\ncharacterize the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the brightest\ngroups and clusters in the survey catalogue. Moreover, given the overall\ncharacteristics of the survey, I also expect to detect some clusters at\nredshift z>1, which will have a strong impact in the study of the large scale\nstructure of the Universe and the cosmological parameters.

In many \"mesoscopic\" transport\nprocesses, the effective many-particle dynamics is dominantly classical, while\nthe microscopic rates governing particle motion are of quantum-mechanical\norigin. We here employ the stochastic path integral approach as an optimal tool\nto probe the fluctuation statistics in such applications. Describing the\nclassical limit of the Keldysh quantum nonequilibrium field theory, the\nstochastic path integral encapsulates the quantum origin of microscopic\nparticle exchange rates. Dynamically, it is equivalent to a transport master\nequation which is a formalism general enough to describe many applications of\npractical interest. We apply the stochastic path integral to derive general\nfunctional fluctuation relations for current flow induced by time-varying\nforces. We show that the successive measurement processes implied by this setup\ndo not put the derivation of quantum fluctuation relations in jeopardy. While\nin many cases the fluctuation relation for a full time-dependent current\nprofile may contain excessive information, we formulate a number of reduced\nrelations, and demonstrate their application to mesoscopic transport.

For an ensemble of linearly independent gyros each measurement signal\ndepends upon the orientation of each single axis gyro with respect to the\nrotational axis of the Earth. Therefore at least 3 gyros are necessary to\nreconstruct the complete angular orientation of the apparatus. In general, the\nsetup consists of several laser gyroscopes (we would prefer more than 3 for\nsufficient redundancy), rigidly referenced to each other. Adding more gyros for\none plane of observation provides a cross-check against intra-system biases and\nfurthermore has the advantage of improving the signal to noise ratio by the\nsquare root of the number of gyros.

Estimates of the\nhydrogen and helium mass and distribution are mainly based on early-time\nspectroscopy and are uncertain since the respective lines are usually observed\nin absorption. Constraining the mass and distribution of H and He is important\nto gain insight into the progenitor systems of these SNe.\n  We implement a NLTE treatment of hydrogen and helium in a three-dimensional\nnebular code.

Moreover, since different models predict different\npatterns of the branching ratios, the measurement of these rare decays at the\nGigaZ may be utilized to distinguish the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 14:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2010 16:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

These systems provide evidence for an additional, invisible\nmass in the separation between the distribution of their total mass, measured\nvia gravitational lensing, and their ordinary 'baryonic' matter, measured via\nits X-ray emission. Unfortunately, the information available from these systems\nis limited by their rarity. Constraints on the properties of dark matter, such\nas its interaction cross-section, are therefore restricted by uncertainties in\nthe individual systems' impact velocity, impact parameter and orientation with\nrespect to the line of sight.\n  Here we develop a complementary, statistical measurement in which every piece\nof substructure falling into every massive cluster is treated as a bullet. We\ndefine 'bulleticity' as the mean separation between dark matter and ordinary\nmatter, and we measure the signal in hydrodynamical simulations.

A subsequent measurement of bulleticity could constrain the\ndark matter cross-section.

To explain this variability,\ndifferent sources of mRNA fluctuations ('Poisson' and 'Telegraph' processes)\nhave been proposed in stochastic models of gene expression. Both Poisson and\nTelegraph scenario models explain experimental observations of noise in protein\nlevels in terms of 'bursts' of protein expression. Correspondingly, there is\nconsiderable interest in establishing relations between burst and steady-state\nprotein distributions for general stochastic models of gene expression. In this\nwork, we address this issue by considering a mapping between stochastic models\nof gene expression and problems of interest in queueing theory. By applying a\ngeneral theorem from queueing theory, Little's Law, we derive exact relations\nwhich connect burst and steady-state distribution means for models with\narbitrary waiting-time distributions for arrival and degradation of mRNAs and\nproteins. The derived relations have implications for approaches to quantify\nthe degree of transcriptional bursting and hence to discriminate between\ndifferent sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression. To illustrate this, we\nconsider a model for regulation of protein expression bursts by small RNAs. For\na broad range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions (validated by\nstochastic simulations) for the mean protein levels as the levels of regulatory\nsmall RNAs are varied. The results obtained show that the degree of\ntranscriptional bursting can, in principle, be determined from changes in mean\nsteady-state protein levels for general stochastic models of gene expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 15:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-02"}
