The\nlatter is specified by the electron number $n$ in the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ level as\n$(d_{3z^2-r^2})^n$. Based on the molecular orbitals formed at the interface and\nthe generalized Hund's rule, the sign of the magnetic interaction is rather\nuniquely determined. The exception is when the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital is\nstabilized in the interfacial manganite layer neighboring to a\n$(d_{3z^2-r^2})^1$ or $(d_{3z^2-r^2})^2$ system. In this case, the magnetic\ninteraction is sensitive to the occupancy of the Mn $d_{3z^2-r2}$ orbital. It\nis also shown that the magnetic interaction between the interfacial Mn layer\nand the bulk region can be changed. Manganite-based heterostructures thus show\na rich magnetic behavior. We also present how to generalize the argument\nincluding $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 16:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The source, with a peak luminosity of L_x=2x10^39 ergs/s, reveals an\norder of magnitude change in the count rate within ~10 ks in a Chandra\nobservation. The BH resides in a metal-rich [Fe/H]~0.2 globular cluster. After\nRZ2109 in NGC 4472 this is only the second black-hole X-ray source in a GC\nconfirmed via rapid X-ray variability. Unlike RZ2109, the X-ray spectrum of\nthis BH source did not change during the period of rapid variability. In\naddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-term\nvariability. After being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a span\nof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, or\nmarginally detectable, in deep Chandra and XMM observations. The source also\nbecame harder as it faded. The characteristics of the long term variability in\nitself provide sufficient evidence to identify the source as a BH. The long\nterm decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized in\nprevious studies because the rapid variability within the bright epoch\nsuppressed the average luminosity in that integration. The hardening of the\nspectrum accompanying the fading would also make this black hole source\nindistinguishable from an accreting neutron star in some epochs. Therefore some\nlow mass X-ray binaries identified as NS accretors in snapshot studies of\nnearby galaxies may also be BHs. Thus the discovery of the second confirmed BH\nin an extragalactic GC through rapid variability at the very least suggests\nthat accreting BHs in GCs are not exceedingly rare occurences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 16:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Methods: Data from Swift-BAT, -XRT and -UVOT together with data from\na number of different ground-based optical/NIR and millimeter telescopes\nallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from the\nhigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. We discuss the physical\nparameters required to model these emissions. Results: The prompt emission of\nGRB060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a few\nseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity and\nspectral hardness. Observations of the afterglow began less than one minute\nafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and it\nwas characterized by a rather flat optical/NIR spectrum which can be\ninterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. On\nthe other hand, the X-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rather\nsoft electron distribution. Conclusions: GRB060908 is a good example of a\ngamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. The\navailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of many\ndifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for various\ninterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this event\nis challenging. In the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtain\noptical/NIR coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the X-ray data for\nmore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burst\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 17:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-15"}

Two major\nscenarios to form such planets are planet migration in a disk, and\nplanet--planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation. The former\nscenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit, while the\nlatter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possibly\nhigh-obliquity orbit, which are then circularized and aligned via tidal\ndissipation. We investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets on\neccentric orbits. We show that the current and future orbital evolution of\nthese systems is likely dominated by tidal dissipation, and not by a more\ndistant companion. Although most of these close-in planets experience orbital\ndecay all the way to the Roche limit, there are two characteristic evolution\npaths for them, depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipation\ninside the star and the planet. We point out that the current observations may\nbe consistent with one of them. Our results suggest that at least some of the\nclose-in planets with non-zero orbital eccentricity may have been formed by\ntidally circularizing an initially eccentric orbit. We also find that even when\nthe stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present, some\nsystems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past.

While\nmany efforts have been made to prove that the Lasso behaves like a variable\nselection procedure at the price of strong (though unavoidable) assumptions on\nthe geometric structure of these variables, much less attention has been paid\nto the analysis of the performance of the Lasso as a regularization algorithm.\nOur first purpose here is to provide a conceptually very simple result in this\ndirection. We shall prove that, provided that the regularization parameter is\nproperly chosen, the Lasso works almost as well as the deterministic Lasso.\nThis result does not require any assumption at all, neither on the structure of\nthe variables nor on the regression function. Our second purpose is to\nintroduce a new estimator particularly adapted to deal with infinite countable\ndictionaries. This estimator is constructed as an l0-penalized estimator among\na sequence of Lasso estimators associated to a dyadic sequence of growing\ntruncated dictionaries. The selection procedure automatically chooses the best\nlevel of truncation of the dictionary so as to make the best tradeoff between\napproximation, l1-regularization and sparsity. From a theoretical point of\nview, we shall provide an oracle inequality satisfied by this selected Lasso\nestimator. The oracle inequalities established for the Lasso and the selected\nLasso estimators shall enable us to derive rates of convergence on a wide class\nof functions, showing that these estimators perform at least as well as greedy\nalgorithms. Besides, we shall prove that the rates of convergence achieved by\nthe selected Lasso estimator are optimal in the orthonormal case by bounding\nfrom below the minimax risk on some Besov bodies. Finally, some theoretical\nresults about the performance of the Lasso for infinite uncountable\ndictionaries will be studied in the specific framework of neural networks. All\nthe oracle inequalities presented in this paper are obtained via the\napplication of a single general theorem of model selection among a collection\nof nonlinear models which is a direct consequence of the Gaussian concentration\ninequality. The key idea that enables us to apply this general theorem is to\nsee l1-regularization as a model selection procedure among l1-balls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 18:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-31"}

The fate of a given binary system is\ndetermined by the initial masses of the primary and companion, the initial\norbit (taken to be circular), the Reimers mass-loss parameter, and the tidal\nprescription employed. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether\nthe orbit expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a\ncommon envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation\nbased on the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict\nperiod gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs.

Assuming that the\nnumber of antennas of the eavesdropper is limited, the secrecy rate of the MIMO\nwiretap channel in the sense of strong secrecy is derived, and shown to match\nwith the converse in secure degrees of freedom. It is proved that there exists\na universal coding scheme that secures the confidential message against any\nsequence of channel states experienced by the eavesdropper. This yields the\nconclusion that secure communication is possible regardless of the location or\nchannel states of (potentially infinite number of) eavesdroppers.

We find that, while\nthey inhabit the optical red sequence, they show a wide spread in their UV\ncolours (~4 mags), akin to what has been discovered recently in the general\nearly-type population. A strong correlation is found between UV colour and the\nstrength of the tidal distortions, such that the bluest galaxies are more\ndistorted. This strongly suggests that the blue UV colours seen in many nearby\nearly-types are driven by (low-level) merger-induced star formation within the\nlast 3 Gyrs, contributing less than 10% of the stellar mass.

The study of the di-lepton\ninvariant mass distribution at the LHC allows to reconstruct some of the masses\nof the different sparticles involved in a decay chain. In particular, the\ncombination with other observables renders feasible the reconstruction of the\nmasses of the intermediate sleptons involved in $ \\chi_2^0\\to \\tilde \\ell\n\\,\\ell \\to \\ell \\,\\ell\\,\\chi_1^0$ decays. Slepton mass splittings can be either\ninterpreted as a signal of non-universality in the SUSY soft breaking-terms\n(signalling a deviation from constrained scenarios as the cMSSM) or as being\ndue to the violation of lepton flavour. In the latter case, in addition to\nthese high-energy processes, one expects further low-energy manifestations of\nLFV such as radiative and three-body lepton decays. Under the assumption of a\ntype-I seesaw as the source of neutrino masses and mixings, all these LFV\nobservables are related.

In the YRZ ansatz a\nconstant RVB gap is assumed which leads to Luttinger zeros along the\nantiferromagnetic Brillouin zone (AFBZ) and four Fermi pockets centered on the\nnodal directions. We relax the assumption of a constant RVB gap function,\ntreating it as a Ising order parameter accompanied by thermal fluctuations. If\nthese thermal fluctuations are very strong leading to strictly short range\ncorrelations in the spatial dependence of the RVB gap, then the reconstruction\nof the Fermi surface into pockets will not survive. We examined the\nintermediate case of critical fluctuations leading to a power law falloff of\nthe RVB gap correlations. To this end we followed the analysis recently\ndeveloped by two of us to treat the effect of the power law correlations in the\nantiferromagnetic 2-dimensional xy model on the single electron Green's\nfunction. The partial truncation of the Fermi surface to form pockets survives\nin the presence of power law correlations. The linewidth of the quasiparticle\npeaks increases with the exponent of the power law correlations.

If this exponent is\ndoubled, a linewidth comparable to the values found in recent ARPES experiments\non underdoped BiSCO (Tc = 65 K) at T = 140K was obtained.

Two mask options for DBC atom chip fabrication are presented,\nas well as two methods for etching wire patterns into the copper layer. The\nwire aspect ratio that optimizes the magnetic field gradient as a function of\npower dissipation is determined to be 0.84:1 (height:width). The optimal wire\nthickness as a function of magnetic trapping height is also determined. A test\nchip, able to support 100 A of current for 2 s without failing, is used to\ndetermine the thermal impedance of the DBC. An assembly using two DBC atom\nchips to provide magnetic confinement is also shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 23:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The advent of high quality vector magnetograms\nobtained from Hinode (SOT/SP) has increased the possibility of meeting this\nchallenge. In particular, the Spatially Averaged Signed Shear Angle (SASSA)\nseems to be an unique parameter to quantify the non-potentiality of the active\nregions. We demonstrate the usefulness of SASSA for predicting the flare\nseverity. For this purpose we present case studies of the evolution of magnetic\nnon-potentiality using 115 vector magnetograms of four active regions namely\nARs NOAA 10930, 10960, 10961 and 10963 during December 08-15, 2006, June 03-10,\n2007, June 28-July 5, 2007 and July 10-17, 2007 respectively. The NOAA ARs\n10930 and 10960 were very active and produced X and M class flares\nrespectively, along with many smaller X-ray flares. On the other hand, the NOAA\nARs 10961 and 10963 were relatively less active and produced only very small\n(mostly A and B-class) flares. For this study we have used a large number of\nhigh resolution vector magnetograms obtained from Hinode (SOT/SP). The analysis\nshows that the peak X-ray flux of the most intense solar flare emanating from\nthe active regions depends on the magnitude of the SASSA at the time of the\nflare. This finding of the existence of a lower limit of SASSA for a given\nclass of X-ray flare will be very useful for space weather forecasting. We have\nalso studied another non-potentiality parameter called mean weighted shear\nangle (MWSA) of the vector magnetograms along with SASSA. We find that the MWSA\ndoes not show such distinction as the SASSA for upper limits of GOES X-Ray flux\nof solar flares, however both the quantities show similar trends during the\nevolution of all active regions studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 06:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Among the observed key findings are (i) a\nminimum variability timescale as short as $\\sim 200$ sec and (ii) highly\nvariable TeV emission, which in the frequency interval [$10^{-4}$ Hz, $10^{-2}$\nHz] can be described by a log-normal distribution and suggests an underlying\nmultiplicative (and not additive) process. Aims: Simultaneously accounting for\nthese findings appears difficult within conventional approaches. Following\nearlier suggestions for the TeV blazar Mkn 501, we explore a possible scenario\nwhere PKS 2155-304 is supposed to harbor a supermassive binary black hole\nsystem and where the observed TeV variability is dominated by emission from the\nless massive black hole. Methods: We analyze the constraints on the very high\nenergy (VHE) source imposed by the observed variability characteristics and the\nintegrated VHE luminosity output, and discuss its implications for a binary\nblack hole system. Results: We show that for a secondary mass of $m_{\\rm BH}\n\\sim 10^7 M_{\\odot}$, fluctuations in the disk accretion rate that feed the jet\ncould account for the observed red-noise type variability process down to\nfrequencies of $\\sim 10^{-2}$ Hz. Jet curvature induced by orbital motion, on\nthe other hand, could further relax constraints on the intrinsic jet speeds.\nConclusions: Because a binary system can lead to different (yet not\nindependent) periodicities in different energy bands, a longterm (quasi-)\nperiodicity analysis could offer important insights into the real nature of the\ncentral engine of PKS~2155-304.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 07:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, according to simulations, in the latter\ndimension the fluid-fluid demixing is metastable with respect to the\nfluid-solid transition. According to the results obtained from approximations\nto the equation of state of hard hyperspheres in higher dimensions, the\nfluid-fluid demixing might becomes stable for high enough dimension. However,\nthis conclusion is rather speculative since none of the above works have taken\ninto account the stability of the crystalline phase (nor by a minimization of a\ngiven density functional, neither spinodal calculations or MC simulations). Of\ncourse, the lack of results is justified by the difficulty for performing\ndensity functional calculations or simulations in high dimensions and, in\nparticular, for highly asymmetric binary mixtures. In the present work, we will\ntake advantage of a well tested theoretical tool, namely the fundamental\nmeasure density functional theory for parallel hard hypercubes (in the\ncontinuum and in the hypercubic lattice). With this, we have calculated the\nfluid-fluid and fluid-solid spinodals for different spatial dimensions. We have\nobtained, no matter of the dimensionality, the mixture size asymmetry nor the\npolydispersity (included as a bimodal distribution function centered around the\nasymmetric edge-lengths), that the fluid-fluid critical point is always located\nabove the fluid-solid spinodal. In conclusion, these results point to the\nexistence of demixing between at least one solid phase rich in large particles\nand one fluid phase rich in small ones, preempting a fluid-fluid demixing,\nindependently of the spatial dimension or the polydispersity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 11:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2011 15:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Among\nother ideas, it has been suggested that a non-linear resonance between two\noscillation modes in an accretion disc orbiting either a black hole or a\nneutron star plays a role in exciting the observed modulation. Several possible\nresonances have been discussed. A particular model assumes resonances in which\nthe disc-oscillation modes have the eigenfrequencies equal to the radial and\nvertical epicyclic frequencies of geodesic orbital motion. This model has been\ndiscussed for black hole microquasar sources as well as for a group of neutron\nstar sources. Assuming several neutron (strange) star equations of state and\nHartle-Thorne geometry of rotating stars, we briefly compare the frequencies\nexpected from the model to those observed. Our comparison implies that the\ninferred neutron star radius \"RNS\" is larger than the related radius of the\nmarginally stable circular orbit \"rms\" for nuclear matter equations of state\nand spin frequencies up to 800Hz. For the same range of spin and a strange star\n(MIT) equation of state, the inferrred radius RNS is roughly equal to rms. The\nPaczynski modulation mechanism considered within the model requires that RNS <\nrms. However, we find this condition to be fulfilled only for the strange\nmatter equation of state, masses below one solar mass, and spin frequencies\nabove 800Hz. This result most likely falsifies the postulation of the neutron\nstar 3:2 resonant eigenfrequencies being equal to the frequencies of geodesic\nradial and vertical epicyclic modes. We suggest that the 3:2 epicyclic modes\ncould stay among the possible choices only if a fairly non-geodesic accretion\nflow is assumed, or if a different modulation mechanism operates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 13:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The specific frequencies of the blue globular clusters in the\ngalaxies in our sample fall in the range 0.34 -- 0.84, similar to typical\nvalues found for later-type spirals. The number of red globular clusters\nassociated with the bulges generally increases with the bulge luminosity,\nsimilar to what is observed for elliptical galaxies, although the specific\nfrequency of bulge clusters is a factor of 2-3 lower for the lowest luminosity\nbulges than for the higher luminosity bulges.

The most widespread technique for creating these quantum\nresources is the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of laser light\ninto photon pairs. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known\nas phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations which are used to produce\ntwo-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom. It has been a\nlongstanding goal of the quantum optics community to realise a source that can\nproduce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches\nconsidered, none have been technically feasible. In this paper we report the\nobservation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Here each\ntriplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum\ncorrelations will extend over all three photons in a way not achievable with\nindependently created photon pairs. We expect our photon-triplet source to open\nup new avenues of quantum optics and become an important tool in quantum\ntechnologies. Our source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum\ncorrelations, the post-selection free generation of tripartite entanglement\nwithout post- selection and the generation of heralded entangled-photon pairs\nsuitable for linear optical quantum computing. Two of the triplet photons have\na wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, ideally suited\nfor three-party quantum communication. Furthermore, our results open\ninteresting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous\ndown-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant\nto optical quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 13:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-30"}

The omnipresence of coronal magnetic loops implies gradients of the\nequilibrium plasma quantities like the density, magnetic field and temperature.\nThese gradients are responsible for the excitation of drift waves that grow\nboth within the two-component fluid description (in the presence of collisions\nand without it) and within the two-component kinetic descriptions (due to\npurely kinetic effects). In the present work the effects of the density\ngradient in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field vector are\ninvestigated within the kinetic theory, in both electrostatic and\nelectromagnetic regimes. The electromagnetic regime implies the coupling of the\ngradient-driven drift wave with the Alfven wave. The growth rates for the two\ncases are calculated and compared. It is found that, in general, the\nelectrostatic regime is characterized by stronger growth rates, as compared\nwith the electromagnetic perturbations. Also discussed is the stochastic\nheating associated with the drift wave. The released amount of energy density\ndue to this heating should be more dependent on the magnitude of the background\nmagnetic field than on the coupling of the drift and Alfven waves. The\nstochastic heating is expected to be much higher in regions with a stronger\nmagnetic field. On the whole, the energy release rate caused by the stochastic\nheating can be several orders of magnitude above the value presently accepted\nas necessary for a sustainable coronal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 13:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-30"}

Remarkably, it is shown that\nthis equilibrium is Pareto-efficient under reasonable sufficient conditions and\nthe corresponding decentralized power control policies can be implemented under\nrealistic information assumptions: only individual channel state information\nand a public signal are required to implement the equilibrium strategies.\nExplicit equilibrium conditions are derived in terms of minimum number of game\nstages or maximum discount factor. Both analytical and simulation results are\nprovided to compare the performance of the proposed power control policies with\nthose already existing and exploiting the same information assumptions namely,\nthose derived for the one-shot and Stackelberg games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2010 15:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-29"}
