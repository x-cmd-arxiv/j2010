The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel\nstate information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three\nlow complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the\nsum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first\nmethod allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the\nsum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally\namong the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is\nproposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference\nfrom other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not\nonly requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also\nrequires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of\npartitioning.

Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for\na certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as\na decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed\nthrough the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective\ncurrencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly\ntransact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A\nnatural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain\nliquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments\nbefore credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term\nfailure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit\nvalues.\n  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path\nalong which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction\nrates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph\nfamilies goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network\nincreases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and\ncredit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are\nwell-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a\nspecial type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite\ncredit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute\nthe steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We\nshow that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\nnetworks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus\nwe do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 22:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 01:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 20:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

We\nfind that as temperature is lowered and timescales are increased, the time\nreparametrization fluctuations become increasingly dominant, and that their\ncorrelation volumes grow together with the correlation volumes of the dynamical\nheterogeneities, while the correlation volumes for longitudinal fluctuations\nremain small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 01:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 06:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2010 16:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 13:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-10"}

The purpose of this work is the evaluation of responsiveness\nwhen remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB).\nResponsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality.\nMethod. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical\nstochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with\nminimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known\nperformance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:\nfrom these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.\nCritical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the\nnumber of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained\nis a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and\nthe request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits,\nusers should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their\nKB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole\ncommunication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are\nnecessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource\nmanagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 11:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06"}

Many biophysical models have been constructed to\nunderstand the mechanism of this motion. However, so far, the basic principle\nabout it remains unclosed. In this paper, based on the recent experimental\nresults and existing theoretical models, a spider-like model is provided. In\nthis model, each motor is regarded as a bead-spring system. The bead can bind\nto or unbind from the track stochastically, and step forward or backward with\nfixed step size L and force dependent transition rates. The spring connects the\nbead to cargo tightly. At any time, the position of cargo is determined by\nforce balance condition. The obvious characteristics of our model are that, the\nmotors interact with each other and they do not share the external load\nequally. Our results indicate, the stall force of cargo, under which the mean\nvelocity of cargo vanishes, usually decreases with the interactions between\nmotors. If the cargo is pulled by several motors from same motor species, the\nstall force of cargo is bigger than that of the single motor, but usually\nsmaller than their sum. However, if the cargo is pulled by two motors with\ndifferent directionality, the stall force of cargo might bigger or smaller than\nthe difference of the two single motor stall forces. The results imply,\ncooperation of several motors is helpful to pull big cargoes, though it is not\nso good as might be expected and no obvious help to improve the velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 15:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We define block-tree graphs as a\ntree-structured graph where each node is a cluster of nodes such that the\nclusters in the graph are disjoint. This differs from junction-trees, where two\nclusters connected by an edge always have at least one common node. When\ncompared to junction-trees, we show that constructing block-tree graphs is\nfaster, and finding optimal block-tree graphs has a much smaller search space.\nApplying our block-tree graph framework to graphical models, we show that, for\nsome graphs, e.g., grid graphs, using block-tree graphs for inference is\ncomputationally more efficient than using junction-trees. For graphical models\nwith boundary conditions, the block-tree graph framework transforms the\nboundary valued problem into an initial value problem. For Gaussian graphical\nmodels, the block-tree graph framework leads to a linear state-space\nrepresentation. Since exact inference in graphical models can be\ncomputationally intractable, we propose to use spanning block-trees to derive\napproximate inference algorithms. Experimental results show the improved\nperformance in using spanning block-trees versus using spanning trees for\napproximate estimation over Gaussian graphical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 15:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2010 18:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-16"}
