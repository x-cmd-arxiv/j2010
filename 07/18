The results indicate that both the\nvolume-average shear and the variance of the expansion rate grow proportional\nto the sharpness of the transition and diverge in the limit of a step function,\nbut, for realistic-sized voids, are virtually independent of the size of the\nvoid. However, the backreaction, given by the difference of the variance and\nthe shear, has a finite value in the step-function limit. By comparing the\nexact result for the backreaction to the case where the shear is neglected by\ntreating the voids and walls as separate Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models, we\nfind that the shear suppresses the backreaction by a factor of (r_0/t_0)^2, the\nsquared ratio of the void size to the horizon size. This exemplifies the\nimportance of using the exact solution for the interface between the regions of\ndifferent expansion rates and densities. The suppression is justified to hold\nalso for a network of compensated voids, but may not hold if the universe is\ndominated by uncompensated voids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2010 16:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We report on HST observations of this field carried out in 2008, in\nfour spectral bands. The astrometric and photometric analyses of these data\nconfirm the identification of the proposed candidate as the pulsar's optical\ncounterpart. Similarly to other middle-aged pulsars, its optical-UV spectrum\ncan be described by the sum of a power-law (PLO) component, presumably emitted\nfrom the pulsar magnetosphere, and a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) component emitted from\nthe NS surface. The spectral index of the PLO component, alpha_O=1.05+/-0.34,\nis larger than for other pulsars with optical counterparts.

In this thesis, we introduce a\ngeneral machine learning approach called unsupervised CRF learning based on\nmaximizing the conditional likelihood. We apply our approach to computer vision\nsystems that recover the 3-D scene geometry from images. We focus on recovering\n3D geometry from single images, stereo pairs and video sequences. Building\nthese systems requires algorithms for doing inference as well as learning the\nparameters of conditional Markov random fields (MRF). Our system is trained\nunsupervisedly without using ground-truth labeled data. We employ a\nslanted-plane stereo vision model in which we use a fixed over-segmentation to\nsegment the left image into coherent regions called superpixels, then assign a\ndisparity plane for each superpixel. Plane parameters are estimated by solving\nan MRF labelling problem, through minimizing an energy fuction. We demonstrate\nthe use of our unsupervised CRF learning algorithm for a parameterized\nslanted-plane stereo vision model involving shape from texture cues. Our stereo\nmodel with texture cues, only by unsupervised training, outperforms the results\nin related work on the same stereo dataset. In this thesis, we also formulate\nstructure and motion estimation as an energy minimization problem, in which the\nmodel is an extension of our slanted-plane stereo vision model that also\nhandles surface velocity. Velocity estimation is achieved by solving an MRF\nlabeling problem using Loopy BP. Performance analysis is done using our novel\nevaluation metrics based on the notion of view prediction error. Experiments on\nroad-driving stereo sequences show encouraging results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2010 19:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}

Following the collapse from\nthe prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk\nformation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to\nfragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core.\nGlobally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content\nfavors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can\nmoderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation. More locally, both the Toomre Q-parameter needs to be below a\ncritical value _and_ the local cooling time needs to be shorter than a few\ntimes the local dynamical time. Fragments that form during the early embedded\nphase tend to be driven into the inner disk regions, and likely trigger mass\naccretion and luminosity bursts that are similar in magnitude to\nFU-Orionis-type or EX-Lupi-like events. Disk accretion is shown to be an\nintrinsically variable process, thanks to disk fragmentation, nonaxisymmetric\nstructure, and the effect of gravitational torques. The additional effect of a\ngeneric \\alpha-type viscosity acts to reduce burst frequency and accretion\nvariability, and is likely to not be viable for values of \\alpha significantly\ngreater than 0.01.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jul 2010 12:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
