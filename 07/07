Here we propose an axiomatic framework for bounded\ndecision-making that considers resource costs. Agents are formalized as\nprobability measures over input-output streams. We postulate that any such\nprobability measure can be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function\nbased on three axioms: utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic\nmappings of probabilities. We show that these axioms enforce a unique\nconversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information).\nMoreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational\nprinciple: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure\nmaximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures\ncan then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new\nconstraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a\ncriterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a\ntarget utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference\ndistribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive\ncontrol problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When\nresource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered. Our formalization\nmight thus provide a principled approach to bounded rationality that\nestablishes a close link to information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 16:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-09"}

The effects of single-ion and\nexchange (spin-orbit) anisotropy are first considered, followed by an analysis\nof the roles played by secondary influences, e.g. disorder, dipolar and\nhyperfine fields, and magnetoacoustic interactions. Special attention is paid\nto the role of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) interaction. This is\ndone within the framework of a 12-spin microscopic model, and also using\nsimplified dimer and tetramer approximations in which the electronic spins are\ngrouped in 2 or 4 blocks, respectively. If the molecule is inversion symmetric,\nthe DM interaction between the dimer halves must be zero. In an inversion\nsymmetric tetramer, two independent DM vectors are allowed, but no new\ntunneling transitions are generated by the DM interaction. Experiments on the\nMn12 wheel can only be explained if the molecular inversion symmetry is broken,\nand we explore this in detail using both models, focussing on the asymmetric\ndisposition and rounding of Berry phase minima associated with quantum\ninterference between states of opposite parity. A remarkable behavior exists\nfor the `Berry phase zeroes' as a function of the directions of the internal DM\nvectors and the external transverse field. A rather drastic breaking of the\nmolecular inversion-symmetry is required to explain the experiments; in the\ntetramer model this requires a reorientation of the DM vectors on one half of\nthe molecule by nearly 180 degrees. This cannot be attributed to sample\ndisorder. These results are of general interest for the quantum dynamics of\ntunneling spins, and lead to some interesting experimental predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 16:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-23"}

It also outlines the major issues in the recent debate over what\nphysical processes dominate the mass, momentum, and energy balance in the\naccelerating wind. A key obstacle in the way of producing realistic simulations\nof the Sun-heliosphere system is the lack of a physically motivated way of\nspecifying the coronal heating rate. Recent models that assume the energy comes\nfrom Alfven waves that are partially reflected, and then dissipated by\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence, have been found to reproduce many of the\nobserved features of the solar wind. This paper discusses results from these\nmodels, including detailed comparisons with measured plasma properties as a\nfunction of solar wind speed.

This work crucially relies on the initial detection of\nthe oscillations, which is commonly done manually. The volume of Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) data will make manual detection inefficient for detecting all\nof the oscillating regions. An algorithm is presented which automates the\ndetection of areas of the solar atmosphere that support spatially extended\noscillations. The algorithm identifies areas in the solar atmosphere whose\noscillation content is described by a single, dominant oscillation within a\nuser-defined frequency range. The method is based on Bayesian spectral analysis\nof time-series and image filtering. A Bayesian approach sidesteps the need for\nan a-priori noise estimate to calculate rejection criteria for the observed\nsignal, and it also provides estimates of oscillation frequency, amplitude and\nnoise, and the error in all these quantities, in a self-consistent way. The\nalgorithm also introduces the notion of quality measures to those regions for\nwhich a positive detection is claimed, allowing simple post-detection\ndiscrimination by the user. The algorithm is demonstrated on two Transition\nRegion and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) datasets, and comments regarding its\nsuitability for oscillation detection in SDO are made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 18:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-07"}

New high S/N, high-resolution spectra are used to perform a\nquantitative measurement of the abundances of the star and determine the\nrelation of the concentrations of the heavier elements on the surface of the\nstar to the helium concentration and the magnetic field orientation. Doppler\nimages have been created using programs described in earlier papers by Rice and\nothers. An alternative surface abundance mapping code has been used to model\nthe helium line variations after our Doppler imaging of certain individual\nhelium lines produced mediocre results. We confirm the long-known existence of\nhelium-rich and helium-poor hemispheres on a Cen and we measure a difference of\nmore than two orders of magnitude in helium abundance from one side of the star\nto the other. Helium is overabundant by a factor of about 5 over much of the\nhelium-rich hemisphere. Of particular note is our discovery that the\nhelium-poor hemisphere has a very high abundance of helium-3, approximately\nequal to the helium-4 abundance. a Cen is therefore a new member of the small\ngroup of helium-3 stars and the first well-established magnetic member of the\nclass. For the three metals investigated here, there are two strong\nconcentrations of abundance near the equator consistent with the positive\nmagnetic maximum and two somewhat weaker concentrations of abundance where the\nhelium concentration is centered and roughly where the negative peak of the\nmagnetic field would be found. Another strong concentration is found near the\nequator and this is not explainable in terms of any simple symmetry with the\nhelium abundance or the apparent magnetic field main polar locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 18:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We have also found that the average instantaneous speeds of the jet\ncomponents show a clear helical pattern along the jet with a characteristic\nscale of 3 mas. Taking into account average speeds of jet components, this\nscale corresponds to a time scale of about 7.7 years. Jet precession can\nexplain the helical path of the quasi-stationary jet component C1 and the\nperiodical modulation of the total flux-density light curves. We have fitted a\nprecession model to the trajectory of the jet component C1, with a viewing\nangle phi=2.6+-2.2 degrees, aperture angle of the precession cone\nOmega=23.9+-1.9 degrees and fixed precession period (in the observers frame) P\n= 7.9 yrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We prove that the multiplicative structure\nconstants of the noncommutative Schur functions, equivalently the coefficients\nof the skew quasisymmetric Schur functions when expanded in the quasisymmetric\nSchur basis, are nonnegative integers, satisfying a Littlewood-Richardson rule\nanalogue that reduces to the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule under $\\chi$.\n  As an application we show that the morphism of algebras from the algebra of\nPoirier-Reutenauer to $Sym$ factors through $NSym$.

In this paper we describe both\nthe scientific and technical construction of our ExploreNEOs program. We\npresent our observational, photometric, and thermal modeling techniques. We\npresent results from the first 101 targets observed in this program. We find\nthat the distribution of albedos in this first sample is quite broad, probably\nindicating a wide range of compositions within the NEO population. Many objects\nsmaller than one kilometer have high albedos (>0.35), but few objects larger\nthan one kilometer have high albedos. This result is consistent with the idea\nthat these larger objects are collisionally older, and therefore possess\nsurfaces that are more space weathered and therefore darker, or are not subject\nto other surface rejuvenating events as frequently as smaller NEOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2010 21:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-08"}

However, a\nsignificant amount of information both about the emitting region and the\npropagation path is carried in the remaining Stokes parameters. These data\nprovide a means to observe parts of the interstellar medium which remain\ninvisible in Stokes I, at any wavelength. For example, when an electromagnetic\nwave propagates through a region containing free electrons and a magnetic\nfield, the plane of polarisation of the wave will rotate - an effect recorded\nonly in Stokes Q and U. The interstellar medium of the Galaxy is such a region,\ncontaining free electrons (observed as HII) and a magnetic field of a few\nmicrogauss. By imaging in Stokes Q and U we are able to observe signatures of\nmagnetic field perturbations from the small scale (tens of pc) to the large\nscale (kpc).

The main result is roughly\nas follows. Given a network of noisy, independent, memoryless point-to-point\nchannels, a collection of communication demands can be met on the given network\nif and only if it can be met on another network where each noisy channel is\nreplaced by a noiseless bit pipe with throughput equal to the noisy channel\ncapacity. This result was known previously for the case of a single-source\nmulticast demand. The result given here treats general demands -- including,\nfor example, multiple unicast demands -- and applies even when the achievable\nrate region for the corresponding demands is unknown in the noiseless network.\nIn part II, definitions of upper and lower bounding channel models for general\nchannels are introduced. By these definitions, a collection of communication\ndemands can be met on a network of independent channels if it can be met on a\nnetwork where each channel is replaced by its lower bounding model andonly if\nit can be met on a network where each channel is replaced by its upper bounding\nmodel. This work derives general conditions under which a network of noiseless\nbit pipes is an upper or lower bounding model for a multiterminal channel.\nExample upper and lower bounding models for broadcast, multiple access, and\ninterference channels are given. It is then shown that bounding the difference\nbetween the upper and lower bounding models for a given channel yields bounds\non the accuracy of network capacity bounds derived using those models. By\nbounding the capacity of a network of independent noisy channels by the network\ncoding capacity of a network of noiseless bit pipes, this approach represents\none step towards the goal of building computational tools for bounding network\ncapacities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 01:35:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2010 00:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-06"}

Water together with O2 are important gas phase ingredients to cool\ndense gas in order to form stars. On dust grains, H2 O is an important\nconstituent of the icy mantle in which a complex chemistry is taking place, as\nrevealed by hot core observations. The formation of water can occur on dust\ngrain surfaces, and can impact gas phase composition. Aims. The formation of\nmolecules such as OH, H2 O, HO2, H2 O2, as well as their deuterated forms and\nO2 and O3 is studied in order to assess how the chemistry varies in different\nastrophysical environments, and how the gas phase is affected by grain surface\nchemistry. Methods. We use Monte Carlo simulations to follow the formation of\nmolecules on bare grains as well as the fraction of molecules released into the\ngas phase. We consider a surface reaction network, based on gas phase\nreactions, as well as UV photo-dissociation of the chemical species. Results.\nWe show that grain surface chemistry has a strong impact on gas phase\nchemistry, and that this chemistry is very different for different dust grain\ntemperatures. Low temperatures favor hydrogenation, while higher temperatures\nfavor oxygenation. Also, UV photons dissociate the molecules on the surface,\nthat can reform subsequently. The formation-destruction cycle increases the\namount of species released into the gas phase. We also determine the time\nscales to form ices in diffuse and dense clouds, and show that ices are formed\nonly in shielded environments, as supported by observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 06:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The\ncluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, including\nelliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. We use two sets of\ncluster models: initially Roche-lobe filling and Roche-lobe underfilling. We\nidentify four distinct mass loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution,\n(2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven mass\nloss before and (4) after core collapse. Both the evolution-induced loss of\nstars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. This is\ndescribed by a delay-function of a few crossing times for Roche-lobe filling\nclusters and a few half mass relaxation times for Roche-lobe underfilling\nclusters. The relaxation-driven mass loss can be described by a simple power\nlaw dependence of the mass dM/dt =-M^{1-gamma}/t0, (with M in Msun) where t0\ndepends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. Gamma is 0.65 for clusters\nwith a King-parameter W0=5 and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with W0=7.\nFor initially Roche-lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described by\nthe same gamma=0.80. The values of the constant t0 are described by simple\nformulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. The mass loss rate increases\nby about a factor two at core collapse and the mass dependence of the\nrelaxation-driven mass loss changes to gamma=0.70 after core collapse. We also\npresent a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual star\nclusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with an\naccuracy of a few percent in most cases. This can be used to predict the mass\nevolution of cluster systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 08:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This observation was performed with Suzaku in December 2009 and was\ntargeted on IGRJ08408-4503, with a net exposure with the X-ray imaging\nspectrometer (XIS, 0.4-10 keV) and the hard X-ray detector (HXD, 15-100 keV) of\n67.4 ks and 64.7 ks, respectively, spanning about three days. The source was\ncaught in a low intensity state characterized by an initially average X-ray\nluminosity level of 4E32 erg/s (0.5-10 keV) during the first 120 ks, followed\nby two long flares (about 45 ks each) peaking at a flux a factor of about 3\nhigher than the initial pre-flare emission. Both XIS spectra (initial emission\nand the two subsequent long flares) can be fitted with a double component\nspectrum, with a soft thermal plasma model together with a power law,\ndifferently absorbed. The spectral characteristics suggest that the source is\naccreting matter even at this very low intensity level. From the HXD\nobservation we place an upper limit of 6E33 erg/s (15-40 keV; 3 kpc distance)\nto the hard X-ray emission, which is the most stringent constrain to the hard\nX-ray emission during a low intensity state in a SFXT, to date. The timescale\nobserved for the two low intensity long flares is indicative of an orbital\nseparation of the order of 1E13 cm in IGRJ08408-4503.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 09:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The kinetic properties of\nhydrogen-isotope (H, D and T) monomers were simulated using a composite method\nconsisting of density functional theory, density functional perturbation theory\nand harmonic transition state theory. The kinetic changes of the magnetic\nproperty and the aromatic $\\pi$ bond of the hydrogenated graphene during the\ndesorption and diffusion of the hydrogen monomer was discussed. The vibrational\nzero-point energy corrections in the activation energies were found to be\nsignificant, ranging from 0.072 to 0.205 eV. The results obtained from\nquantum-mechanically modified harmonic transition state theory were compared\nwith the ones obtained from classical-limit harmonic transition state theory\nover a wide temperature range. The phonon spectra of hydrogenated graphene were\nused to closely explain the (reversed) isotope effects in the prefactor,\nactivation energy and jump frequency of the hydrogen monomer. The kinetic\nproperties of the hydrogen-isotope monomers were simulated under conditions of\nannealing for 10 minutes and of heating at a constant rate (1.0 K/s). The\nisotope effect was observed; that is, a hydrogen monomer of lower mass is\ndesorbed and diffuses more easily (with lower activation energies). The results\npresented herein are very similar to other reported experimental observations.\nThis study of the kinetic properties of the hydrogen monomer and many other\ninvolved implicit mechanisms provides a better understanding of the interaction\nbetween hydrogen and graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 11:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 05:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2010 10:28:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 02:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}

When G has polynomial\nvolume growth, weighted L^1 estimates are obtained for the convolution kernel\nof the operator m(L_1,...,L_n) corresponding to a compactly supported\nmultiplier m satisfying some smoothness condition. The order of smoothness\nwhich we require on m is related to the degree of polynomial growth of G.

Due to a strong coupling between structure and polarization, the order\nparameter of ferroelectric transitions, they result in large errors in\nestimation of temperature dependent ferroelectric structural transition\nproperties. Here, we employ a recently developed GGA functional of Wu and Cohen\n[Phys. Rev. B 73, 235116 (2006)] and determine total-energy surfaces for\nzone-center distortions of BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and SrTiO3, and compare them with\nthe ones obtained with calculations based on standard LDA and GGA. Confirming\nthat the Wu and Cohen functional allows better estimation of structural\nproperties at 0 K, we determine a new set of parameters defining the effective\nHamiltonian for ferroelectric transition in BaTiO3. Using the new set of\nparameters, we perform molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations under effective\npressures p=0.0 GPa, p=-2.0 GPa, and p=-0.005T GPa.

The competition between the screening\nand the momentum exchange during scattering events can also lead to a valley in\nthe density dependence of the hole spin relaxation time in the low density\nregime. At high temperature, the effect of the screening is suppressed due to\nthe small screening constant.

This includes a very large glitch\nthat occurred between 2005 August 26 and September 8 (MJDs 53608 and 53621).\nThe relative increase in rotational frequency for this glitch,\n$\\Delta\\nu_{g}/\\nu~\\sim~20.5\\times10^{-6}$, is the largest ever seen. Although\naccounting for less than 1\\% of the glitch, there were two well-defined\nexponential decay terms with time constants of 21 and 147 days respectively.\nThere was also a large long-term increase in the spindown rate with\n$\\Delta\\dot\\nu_p/\\dot\\nu \\sim 0.011$ at the time of the glitch. A highly\nsignificant oscillation with a period of close to one year is seen in the\npost-glitch residuals. It is very unlikely that this can be accounted for by a\npulsar position error or proper motion -- it appears to result from effects\ninterior to the neutron star. Implications of these results for pulsar glitch\nmodels are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 14:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The dynamics of solid bodies embedded in\nsuch discs (dust grains, boulders, planetesimals and planets) may be strongly\naffected by the turbulence, such that the formation pathways for planetary\nsystems are determined in part by the strength and spatial distribution of the\nturbulent flow.\n  We examine the dynamics of planetesimals, with radii between 1m \\^a 10 km,\nembedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs, using three dimensional MHD\nsimulations. The planetesimals experience gas drag and stochastic gravitational\nforces due to the turbulent disc. We use, and compare the results from, local\nshearing box simulations and global models in this study.\n  The main aims of this work are to examine: the growth, and possible\nsaturation, of the velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals as a function\nof their size and disc parameters; the rate of radial migration and diffusion\nof planetesimals; the conditions under which the results from shearing box and\nglobal simulations agree.\n  We find good agreement between local and global simulations when shearing\nboxes of dimension 4H x 16H x 2H are used (H being the local scale height). The\nmagnitude of the density fluctuations obtained is sensitive to the box size,\ndue to the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves. This affects the\nstochastic forcing experienced by planetesimals. [...]\n  Our models show that fully developed MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs\nwould have a destructive effect on embedded planetesimals. Relatively low\nlevels of turbulence are required for traditional models of planetesimal\naccretion to operate, this being consistent with the existence of a dead zone\nin protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 14:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We measure extinctions\ndirectly from the Balmer decrement of each source, and while higher values of\nextinction are associated with an increase in any of the three parameters, we\ndemonstrate that the fundamental property that governs extinction is stellar\nmass. After this mass-dependent relationship is removed, there is very little\nsystematic dependence of the residual extinctions with either SFR or\nmetallicity, and no significant improvement is obtained from a more general\nparameterisation. In contrast to this, if either a SFR-dependent or\nmetallicity-dependent extinction relationship is applied, the residual\nextinctions show significant trends that correlate with the other parameters.\nUsing the SDSS data, we present a relationship to predict the median dust\nextinction of a sample of galaxies from its stellar mass, which has a scatter\nof ~0.3 mag. The relationship was calibrated for H-alpha emission, but can be\nmore generally applied to radiation emitted at other wavelengths. These results\nhave important applications for studies of high-redshift galaxies, where\nindividual extinction measurements are hard to obtain but stellar mass\nestimates can be relatively easily estimated from long-wavelength data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 14:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We provide two sets\nof constraints on the annihilation cross-sections/decay lifetimes. In the one\nset of constraints we ignore any source of anti-protons other than dark matter,\nwhich give the highest allowed cross-sections/inverse lifetimes. In the other\nset we include also anti-protons produced in collisions of cosmic rays with\ninterstellar medium nuclei, getting tighter but more realistic constraints on\nthe annihilation cross-sections/decay lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 15:07:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2011 19:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}
