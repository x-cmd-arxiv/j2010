The intrinsic colour scatter about the CMR is\nvery small (0.076) in rest-frame U-V. Only 7% of the galaxies are significantly\nbluer than the CMR. The scarcity of blue S0s indicates that, if they are the\ndescendants of spirals, these were already red when they became S0s. We observe\nno dependence of the CMR scatter with redshift or cluster velocity dispersion.\nThis implies that by the time cluster E/S0s achieve their morphology, the vast\nmajority have already joined the red sequence.

E and S0 galaxies\nexhibit very similar colour scatter, implying similar stellar population ages.\nWe also find that fainter ETs finished forming their stars later, consistent\nwith the cluster red sequence being built over time and the brightest galaxies\nreaching the red sequence earlier than fainter ones. Finally, we find that the\nET cluster galaxies must have had their star formation truncated over an\nextended period of at least 1 Gyr.

Recently, the interest in this area has\nbeen revived trough the anti-de-Sitter space/Conformal Field Theory\ncorrespondence (AdS/CFT) with the difference that in this case the background\ngeometry is Anti de Sitter in five dimensions. In a recent project that we have\ncompleted in the context of AdS/CFT, we have gained insight in the problem of\nshockwaves and our goal in this work is to apply the technique we have\ndeveloped there in the case of ordinary gravity. In the current project, each\nof the shockwaves correspond to a point-like Stress-Energy tensor that moves\nwith the speed of light while the collision is asymmetric and involves an\nimpact parameter (b). Our method is to expand the metric $(g_{\\mu \\nu})$ in the\nbackground of flat space-time in the presence of the two shockwaves and compute\ncorrections that satisfy causal boundary conditions taking into account\nback-reactions of the Stress-Energy tensor of the two point-like particles. Our\nsolution respects causality as expected but this casual dependence takes place\nin an intuitive way. In particular, $g_{\\mu \\nu}$ at any given point $\\vec{r}$\non the transverse plane at fixed $\\tau$ evolves according from whether the\npropagation from the center of each of the shockwaves or from both shockwaves\nhas enough proper time ($\\tau$) to reach the point under consideration or not.\nSimultaneously around the center of each shockwave, the future metric develops\na $\\delta$-function profile with radius $\\tau$; therefore this profile expands\noutwards from the centers (of the shockwaves) with the speed of light. Finally,\nwe discuss the case of the zero impact parameter collision which results to the\nviolation of conservation and we argue that this might be a signal for the\nformation of a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 19:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-09"}

We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to\nassess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we\nconfirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., there\nis no apparent color bimodality for AGN hosts from z~0-2, but non-AGN galaxy\ncolor bimodality exists up to z~3; most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the\nAGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and the\ncolors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass\nincreases up to z~2-3. Second, we point out that it is critical to use\nmass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and\nnon-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, AGN hosts\nlie in the same CMD region as non-AGN galaxies; i.e., there is no specific\nclustering of AGN hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or\nthe green valley in between. The AGN fraction (~10%) is mostly independent of\nhost-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of SMBH growth in\ntypical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with\nnon-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and\nthe AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find,\nfor mass-matched samples, that the SFRs of AGN hosts are typically a factor of\n~2-3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this difference\ndiminishes at z~1-3. Our results can be reasonably explained by two main\ningredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution of\ngalaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN\nfeedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A favored model for their formation was capture during the\ncoagulation growth of bodies in the early KB. Instead, recent studies suggested\nthat large objects can rapidly form in the protoplanetary disks when swarms of\nlocally concentrated solids collapse under their own gravity. Here we examine\nthe possibility that KB binaries formed during gravitational collapse when the\nexcess of angular momentum prevented the agglomeration of available mass into a\nsolitary object. We find that this new mechanism provides a robust path toward\nthe formation of KB binaries with observed properties, and can explain wide\nsystems such as 2001 QW322 and multiples such as (47171) 1999 TC36. Notably,\nthe gravitational collapse is capable of producing 100% binary fraction for a\nwide range of the swarm's initial angular momentum values. The binary\ncomponents have similar masses (80% have the secondary-over-primary radius\nratio >0.7) and their separation ranges from ~1,000 to ~100,000 km. The binary\norbits have eccentricities from e=0 to ~1, with the majority having e<0.6. The\nbinary orbit inclinations with respect to the initial angular momentum of the\nswarm range from i=0 to ~90 deg, with most cases having i<50 deg. Our binary\nformation mechanism implies that the primary and secondary components in each\nbinary pair should have identical bulk composition, which is consistent with\nthe current photometric data.

The weaker lines of CN 2_2-1_1, DCO+ 3-2, N2H+ 3-2, H2CO\n3_03-2_02 and 4_14-3_13 are detected toward two to three disks each, and DCN\n3-2 only toward LkCa 15. CH3OH 4_21-3_12 and c-C3H2 are not detected. There is\nno obvious difference between the T Tauri and Herbig Ae sources with regard to\nCN and HCN intensities. In contrast, DCO+, DCN, N2H+ and H2CO are detected only\ntoward the T Tauri stars, suggesting that the disks around Herbig Ae stars lack\ncold regions for long enough timescales to allow for efficient deuterium\nchemistry, CO freeze-out, and grain chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 21:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

There are several accretion disc\nmodels in the literature that account for this aspect. However, none is\ndesigned to simultaneously explain the presence of powerful jets detected\nduring these states. A new quasi-keplerian hot accretion disc solution, a Jet\nEmitting disc (JED hereafter), which is part of a global disc-jet MHD structure\nproducing stationary super-alfv\\'enic ejection, is investigated here. Its\nradiative and energetic properties are then compared to the observational\nconstraints found in Cygnus X-1. We solve the disc energy equation by balancing\nthe local heating term with advection and cooling by synchrotron,\nbremsstrahlung and Comptonization processes. The heating term, disc density,\naccretion velocity and magnetic field amplitude were taken from published\nself-similar models of accretion-ejection structures. Both optically thin and\nthick regimes are considered in a one temperature gas supported disc. Three\nbranches of solutions are found possible at a given radius but we investigate\nonly the hot, optically thin and geometrically slim solutions. These solutions\ngive simultaneously, and in a consistent way, the radiative and energetics\nproperties of the disc-jet system. They are able to very well reproduce the\naccretion-ejection properties of Cygnus X-1, namely its X-ray spectral\nemission, jet power and jet velocity. About half of the released accretion\npower is used to produce two mildly relativistic (v/c~0.5) jets and for a\nluminosity of the order of 1\\% of the Eddington luminosity, the JED temperature\nand optical depth are close to that observed in the hard state Cygnus X-1. The\nJEDs properties are in agreement with the observations of the prototypical\nblack hole binary Cygnus X-1. and are likely to be relevant to the whole class\nof microquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 21:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The observed lines involve high rotational quantum numbers,\nwhich, combined with previously obtained lower-frequency data, make it possible\nto study in detail the chemical and physical properties of, essentially, the\nentire circumstellar envelope of chi Cyg. The data were obtained using the HIFI\ninstrument aboard Herschel, whose high spectral resolution provides valuable\ninformation about the line profiles. Detailed, non-LTE, radiative transfer\nmodelling, including dust radiative transfer coupled with a dynamical model,\nhas been performed to derive the temperature, density, and velocity structure\nof the circumstellar envelope. We report the first detection of circumstellar\nH2O rotational emission lines in an S-star. Using the high-J CO lines to derive\nthe parameters for the circumstellar envelope, we modelled both the ortho- and\npara-H2O lines. Our modelling results are consistent with the velocity\nstructure expected for a dust-driven wind. The derived total H2O abundance\n(relative to H2) is (1.1 +/- 0.2)E-5, much lower than that in O-rich stars. The\nderived ortho-to-para ratio of 2.1 +/- 0.6 is close to the high-temperature\nequilibrium limit, consistent with H2O being formed in the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 09:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We explicitly show that the pressure is a\ncontinuous function of the temperature across a phase transition at $T_c =\n266.5 \\MeV$. The entropy and energy densities have finite jump discontinuities\nat $T_c$ with latent heat $\\epsilon_{LH}= 1.414$. This is a firm evidence of\nthe first-order phase transition in SU(3) pure gluon plasma. The heat capacity\nhas a $\\delta$-type singularity (an essential discontinuity) at $T_c$, so that\nthe velocity of sound squared becomes zero at this point. All the independent\nthermodynamic quantities are exponentially suppressed below $T_c$ and rather\nslowly approach their respective Stefan-Boltzmann limits at high temperatures.\nThose thermodynamic quantities which are the ratios of their independent\ncounterparts such as conformity, conformality and the velocity of sound squared\napproach their Stefan-Boltzmann limit at high temperatures rather rapidly and\ndemonstrate the non-trivial dependence on the temperature below $T_c$. We\npredict the existence of the three massive and the two massless excitations,\nall of non-perturbative dynamical origin. One of the massive excitations has an\neffective mass $1.17 \\GeV$ and the two others have the same effective mass\n$0.585 \\GeV$, but are propagating in different ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 12:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 12:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 09:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

The instrument will provide high-precision\nnarrow-angle astrometry and phase-referenced interferometric imaging in the\nastronomical K-band for faint objects. We describe the wide range of science\nthat will be tackled with this instrument, highlighting the unique capabilities\nof the VLTI in combination with GRAVITY. The most prominent goal is to observe\nhighly relativistic motions of matter close to the event horizon of Sgr A*, the\nmassive black hole at center of the Milky Way. We present the preliminary\ndesign that fulfils the requirements that follow from the key science drivers:\nIt includes an integrated optics, 4-telescope, dual feed beam combiner operated\nin a cryogenic vessel; near-infrared wavefrontsensing adaptive optics;\nfringe-tracking on secondary sources within the field of view of the VLTI and a\nnovel metrology concept. Simulations show that 10 {\\mu}as astrometry within few\nminutes is feasible for a source with a magnitude of mK = 15 like Sgr A*, given\nthe availability of suitable phase reference sources (mK = 10). Using the same\nsetup, imaging of mK = 18 stellar sources in the interferometric field of view\nis possible, assuming a full night of observations and the corresponding UV\ncoverage of the VLTI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 15:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

By investigating a\ndisordered MnAs-GaAs composite material, it is found that the magnitude of the\nlinear magnetoresistance (LMR) is numerically equal to the carrier mobility\nover a wide range and is independent of carrier density. This behavior is\ncomplementary to the Hall effect that is independent of the mobility and\ndependent on the carrier density. Moreover, the LMR appears to be insensitive\nto the details of the disorder and points to a universal explanation of\nclassical LMR that can be applied to other material systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 15:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Limited intrinsic efficiency of the\nprotocol, imperfect devices and eavesdropping produce errors and information\nleakage from which the set of measured signals -the raw key- must be stripped\nin order to distill a final, information theoretically secure, key. The key\ndistillation process is a classical one in which basis reconciliation, error\ncorrection and privacy amplification protocols are applied to the raw key. This\ncleaning process is known as information reconciliation and must be done in a\nfast and efficient way to avoid cramping the performance of the QKD system.\nBrassard and Salvail proposed a very simple and elegant protocol to reconcile\nkeys in the secret-key agreement context, known as Cascade, that has become the\nde-facto standard for all QKD practical implementations. However, it is highly\ninteractive, requiring many communications between the legitimate parties and\nits efficiency is not optimal, imposing an early limit to the maximum tolerable\nerror rate. In this paper we describe a low-density parity-check reconciliation\nprotocol that improves significantly on these problems. The protocol exhibits\nbetter efficiency and limits the number of uses of the communications channel.\nIt is also able to adapt to different error rates while remaining efficient,\nthus reaching longer distances or higher secure key rate for a given QKD\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2010 15:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2011 09:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}
