Many models have been proposed to represent\nembedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles,\ncharacteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite\nstate machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In\nthis report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for\nEmbedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures\nconcurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be\nrepresentative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness\nby allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed\nabove, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports\nconcurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the\nliterature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast,\nequivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek\nto devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 16:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 09:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 20:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 18:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-26"}

[SODA 2007],\nthe elements of a given matroid are presented to an online algorithm in random\norder. When an element is revealed, the algorithm learns its weight and decides\nwhether or not to select it under the restriction that the selected elements\nform an independent set in the matroid. The objective is to maximize the total\nweight of the chosen elements. In the most studied version of this problem, the\nalgorithm has no information about the weights beforehand. We refer to this as\nthe zero information model. In this paper we study a different model, also\nproposed by Babaioff et al., in which the relative order of the weights is\nrandom in the matroid. To be precise, in the random assignment model, an\nadversary selects a collection of weights that are randomly assigned to the\nelements of the matroid. Later, the elements are revealed to the algorithm in a\nrandom order independent of the assignment.\n  Our main result is the first constant competitive algorithm for the matroid\nsecretary problem in the random assignment model. This solves an open question\nof Babaioff et al. Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $2e^2/(e-1)$.\nIt exploits the notion of principal partition of a matroid, its decomposition\ninto uniformly dense minors, and a $2e$-competitive algorithm for uniformly\ndense matroids we also develop. As additional results, we present simple\nconstant competitive algorithms in the zero information model for various\nclasses of matroids including cographic, low density and the case when every\nelement is in a small cocircuit. In the same model, we also give a\n$ke$-competitive algorithm for $k$-column sparse linear matroids, and a new\n$O(\\log r)$-competitive algorithm for general matroids of rank $r$ which only\nuses the relative order of the weights seen and not their numerical value, as\npreviously needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 17:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

Our idea is to investigate whether a\nmassive planet could induce any observable effect on the spectral lines\nemerging in the disks atmosphere. As a tracer molecule we propose CO, which is\nexcited in the ro-vibrational fundamental band in the disk atmosphere to a\ndistance of ~2-3 AU (depending on the stellar mass) where terrestrial planets\nare thought to form. The synthetic molecular spectral line profiles were\ncalculated by an own developed semi-analytical double layer disk model. 2D gas\ndynamics were incorporated in the calculation of synthetic spectral lines. We\ndemonstrate that a massive planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk strongly\ninfluences the originally circular Keplerian gas dynamics. The perturbed motion\nof the gas can be detected by comparing the CO line profiles in emission, which\nis emerge from planet-bearing to those of planet-free disk models. The planet\nsignal has two major characteristics: a permanent line profile asymmetry, and\nshort timescale variability correlated with the orbital phase of the giant\nplanet. We have found that the strength of the asymmetry depends on the\nphysical parameters of the star-planet-disk system, such as the disk\ninclination angle, the planetary and stellar masses, the orbital distance, and\nthe size of the disk inner cavity. The permanent line profile asymmetry is\ncaused by a disk in an eccentric state in the gap opened by the giant planet.\nHowever, the variable component is a consequence of the local dynamical\nperturbation by the orbiting giant planet. We show that a forming giant planet,\nstill embedded in the protoplanetary disk, can be detected using contemporary\nor future high-resolution near-IR spectrographs like VLT/CRIRES and ELT/METIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 18:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2010 01:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 13:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The different types of radioactive decay, alpha,\nbeta, and gamma decay, all are different types of interactions causing the\nsame, spontaneous, and time-independent decay of an unstable nucleus into\nanother and more stable nucleus. Nuclear reactions in cosmic sites re-arrange\nthe basic constituents of atomic nuclei (neutrons and protons) among the\ndifferent configurations which are allowed by Nature, thus producing\nradioactive isotopes as a by-product. Throughout cosmic history, such reactions\noccur in different sites, and lead to rearrangements of the relative abundances\nof cosmic nuclei, a process called cosmic chemical evolution, which can be\nstudied through the observations of radioactivity. The special role of\nradioactivity in such studies is contributed by the intrinsic decay of such\nmaterial after it has been produced in cosmic sites. This brings in a new\naspect, the clock of the radioactive decay. Observational studies of cosmic\nradioactivities intrinsically obtain isotopic information which are at the\nheart of cosmic nucleosynthesis. They are best performed by precision mass\nspectroscopy in terrestrial laboratories, which has been combined with\nsophisticated radiochemistry to extract meteoritic components originating from\noutside the solar system, and by spectroscopy of characteristic gamma-ray lines\nemitted upon radioactive decay in cosmic environments and measured with\nspace-based telescopes. This book describes where and how specific astronomical\nmessages from cosmic radioactivity help to complement the studies of cosmic\nnucleosynthesis sites anad of cosmic chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 21:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-16"}

In semileptonic decay\nmodes, this often leads to the merging of the b-jet and the hard lepton\naccording to standard event reconstructions, which can complicate new physics\nsearches. Here we explore ways of efficiently recovering this signal in the\nmuon channel at the LHC. We perform a particle-level study of events with muons\nproduced inside of boosted tops, as well as in generic QCD jets and from\nW-strahlung off of hard quarks. We characterize the discriminating power of\ncuts previously explored in the literature, as well two new ones. We find a\nparticularly powerful isolation variable which can potentially reject light QCD\njets with hard embedded muons at the 10^3 level while retaining 80~90% of the\ntops. This can also be fruitfully combined with other cuts for O(1) greater\ndiscrimination. For W-strahlung, a simple pT-scaled maximum \\Delta R cut\nperforms comparably to a highly idealized top-mass reconstruction, rejecting an\nO(1) fraction of the background with percent-scale loss of signal. Using these\nresults, we suggest a set of well-motivated baseline cuts for any physics\nanalysis involving semileptonic top quarks at TeV-scale momenta, using neither\nb-tagging nor missing energy as discriminators. We demonstrate the utility of\nour cuts in searching for resonances in the top-antitop invariant mass\nspectrum. For example, our results suggest that 100 fb^{-1} of data from a 14\nTeV LHC could be used to discover a warped KK gluon up to 4.5 TeV or higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 22:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

We show that under\ncertain conditions on the state transition probabilities of the arms, a sample\nmean based index policy achieves logarithmic regret uniformly over the total\nnumber of trials. The result shows that sample mean based index policies can be\napplied to learning problems under the rested Markovian bandit model without\nloss of optimality in the order. Moreover, comparision between Anantharam's\nindex policy and UCB shows that by choosing a small exploration parameter UCB\ncan have a smaller regret than Anantharam's index policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 02:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 05:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2022 11:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

Signatures\nof magnetic reconnection, generally including a plasma jet of ~30 km/s within a\nmagnetic field rotational region, are clearly present at boundaries of about\n42% of the flux ropes and 14% of the wave trains. The reconnection exhausts are\noften observed to show a local increase in the proton temperature, density and\nplasma beta.

In\nthis contribution I discuss the following points, with emphasize on the last\none that deals with magnetic fields in cooling flow clusters. (1) Both\nAGN-feedback and hot-gas cooling to form stars occur during galaxy formation as\nwell as in cooling flow clusters. Ignoring cooling of the intra-cluster medium,\nas implied by the term \"cool core\", does not encourage comparative study of AGN\nfeedback in cooling flow clusters with that of galaxy formation. (2) The line\nof thought that there is no cooling might lead to wrong questions and research\ndirections. (3) A key question in both cooling flow clusters and during galaxy\nformation is the mode of accretion by the super massive black hole (SMBH). When\ncooling is neglected only accretion from the hot phase remains. Accretion from\nthe hot phase, such as the Bondi accretion, suffers from some severe problems.\n(4) When it is accepted that moderate quantities of gas are cooling, it becomes\nclear that global heat conduction must be substantially suppressed. This does\nnot favor a globally ordered magnetic field. As well, it makes global heat\nconduction unattractive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 04:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2010 08:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-30"}

The Glauber dynamics is the Markov chain that updates a\nrandomly chosen vertex in each step. On the infinite tree with branching factor\n$b$, the hard-core model can be equivalently defined as a broadcasting process\nwith a parameter $\\omega$ which is the positive solution to\n$\\lambda=\\omega(1+\\omega)^b$, and vertices are occupied with probability\n$\\omega/(1+\\omega)$ when their parent is unoccupied.

Reconstruction has\nbeen of considerable interest recently since it appears to be intimately\nconnected to the efficiency of local algorithms on locally tree-like graphs,\nsuch as sparse random graphs.

More importantly, for chain lengths on the\norder of 100, we find our finite-open-chain calculation overestimates some\ninfinite-chain exponents (as did a recent density-matrix renormalization-group\n(DMRG) calculation on finite smooth chains), whereas our finite-periodic-chain\ncalculation underestimates these exponents. We attribute this systematic\ndifference to the different choice of boundary conditions. Eventually, both\nfinite-chain exponents approach the infinite-chain limit: by a chain length of\n1000 for periodic chains, and > 2000 for open chains. There is, howwever, a\nmisleading apparent finite size scaling convergence at shorter chain lengths,\nfor both our finite-chain exponents, as well as the finite-smooth-chain\nexponents. Implications of this observation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 05:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2011 08:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In the post-starburst\nsample we are unable to detect any radial gradients in the Hdelta line\nequivalent width - although one galaxy exhibits a gradient from one side of the\ngalaxy to the other. The absence of Hdelta gradients in these galaxies is\nconsistent with their production via interaction with the intra-cluster medium,\nhowever, our limited spatial sampling prevents us from drawing robust\nconclusions. All members of the sample have early type morphologies, typical of\npost-starburst galaxies in general, but lack the high incidence of tidal tails\nand disturbances seen in local field samples. This argues against a merger\norigin and adds weight to a scenario where truncation by the intra-cluster\nmedium is at work.

In contrast the dusty-starburst sample shows a tendency for a\ncentral concentration of OII3727 emission. This is most straightforwardly\ninterpreted as the consequence of a central starburst. However, other\npossibilities exist such as a non-uniform dust distribution (which is expected\nin such galaxies) and/or a non-uniform starburst age distribution.

For the IPv4 network, the phase change\noccurred in 2001. Before then the network's size grew exponentially, and\nthereafter it followed a linear growth. Changes are also observed around the\nsame time for the maximum node degree, the average node degree and the average\nshortest path length. For the IPv6 network, the phase change occurred in late\n2006. It is notable that the observed phase transitions in the two networks are\ndifferent, for example the size of IPv6 network initially grew linearly and\nthen shifted to an exponential growth. Our results show that following decades\nof rapid expansion up to the beginning of this century, the IPv4 network has\nnow evolved into a mature, steady stage characterised by a relatively slow\ngrowth with a stable network structure; whereas the IPv6 network, after a slow\nstartup process, has just taken off to a full speed growth.

The\nbenchmarking is performed with the increasing complexity of the considered\nprocesses: (1) the pure gas-phase chemistry, (2) the gas-phase chemistry with\naccretion and desorption, and (3) the full gas-grain model with surface\nreactions. Using atomic initial abundances with heavily depleted metals and\nhydrogen in its molecular form, the chemical evolution is modeled within 10^9\nyears. The time-dependent abundances calculated with the two chemical models\nare essentially the same for all considered physical cases and for all species,\nincluding the most complex polyatomic ions and organic molecules.

Objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters and\nlow-mass galaxies, such as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radius\nrelation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals.\nHere we show that at an age of 10 Gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at\n~10^6 Msun is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globular\nclusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hard\nbinaries. From numerical simulations we find that the combined energy\nproduction of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux of\nenergy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. An\nimportant property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass\nradius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of\nbound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial\nmass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that the\npresent day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar\nsystems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters\nhave moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and\ndynamical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 13:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-17"}

Additionally, the\nconductance acquires a notable asymmetry as a function of the incident electron\nenergy, due to the topological influence of the dislocations, while resonances\nappear at the coupling energy of Majorana states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 15:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 00:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2011 17:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-02"}

These objects appear to\nbe the long-sought pulsar and its wind nebula. The X-ray spectrum of the point\nsource is best described by an absorbed powerlaw model with Gamma=1.6 and an\nN_H of ~1x10^(22) cm^(-2).

The basis of the algorithm is the Maximum Minimum Parents and\nChildren algorithm developed by previous authors, with three substantial\nmodifications. The MMPC algorithm is the first stage of the Maximum Minimum\nHill Climbing algorithm for learning the directed acyclic graph of a Bayesian\nnetwork, introduced by previous authors. The MMHC algorithm runs in two phases;\nfirstly, the MMPC algorithm to locate the skeleton and secondly an edge\norientation phase. The computationally expensive part is the edge orientation\nphase.\n  The first modification introduced to the MMPC algorithm, which requires\nlittle additional computational cost, is to obtain the immoralities and hence\nthe essential graph. This renders the edge orientation phase, the\ncomputationally expensive part, unnecessary, since the entire Markov structure\nthat can be derived from data is present in the essential graph.\n  Secondly, the MMPC algorithm can accept independence statements that are\nlogically inconsistent with those rejected, since with tests for independence,\na `do not reject' conclusion for a particular independence statement is taken\nas `accept' independence. An example is given to illustrate this and a\nmodification is suggested to ensure that the conditional independence\nstatements are logically consistent.\n  Thirdly, the MMHC algorithm makes an assumption of faithfulness. An example\nof a data set is given that does not satisfy this assumption and a modification\nis suggested to deal with some situations where the assumption is not\nsatisfied. The example in question also illustrates problems with the\n`faithfulness' assumption that cannot be tackled by this modification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2010 10:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-19"}

The causal net can be embedded in\n3+1 dimensions and is consistent with the conventional Dirac equation. In the\nlow velocity limit the causal net approximates to the Schrodinger equation and\nPauli equation for an electromagnetic field.
