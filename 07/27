We show that\nclusters in our sample have more than one component; in some clusters different\ncomponents also have different galaxy content. We find that in some clusters\nwith substructure the peculiar velocities of the first ranked galaxies are\nlarge. All clusters in our sample host luminous red galaxies. They can be found\nboth in the central areas of clusters as well as in the outskirts, some of them\nhave large peculiar velocities. About 1/3 of red galaxies in clusters are\nspirals.

The presence of substructure in rich clusters, signs\nof possible mergers and infall, as well as the large peculiar velocities of the\nfirst ranked galaxies suggest that the clusters in our sample are not yet\nvirialized.

The aim is\nto find an empirical relationship (justifying using first principles) between\nthe planetary magnetic moment, the mass of the planet, its rotation period and\nthe electrical conductivity of its most conductive layer. Then this is applied\nto Hot Jupiters. Using all the magnetic planetary bodies of the solar system\nand tracing a graph of the dipolar magnetic moment versus body mass parameter,\nthe rotation period and electrical conductivity of the internal conductive\nlayer is obtained. An empirical, functional relation was constructed, which was\nadjusted to a power law curve in order to fit the data. Once this empirical\nrelation has been defined, it is theoretically justified and applied to the\ncalculation of the dipolar magnetic moment of the extra solar planets known as\nHot Jupiters. Almost all data calculated is interpolated, bestowing confidence\nin terms of their validity. The value for the dipolar magnetic moment, obtained\nfor the exoplanet Osiris (HD209458b), helps understand the way in which the\natmosphere of a planet with an intense magnetic field can be eroded by stellar\nwind.

Color transparency onsets when the\ntime of formation of the charmonium wave function becomes longer than the\ninter-nucleon spacing. In this energy regime the effective break-up cross\nsection for a c-cbar dipole depends on energy and nuclear path length, and\nagrees well with data from fixed target experiments, both in magnitude and\nenergy dependence. At higher energies of RHIC and LHC coherence in c-cbar pair\nproduction leads to charm quark shadowing which is a complement to the high\ntwist break up cross section. These two effects explain well with no adjusted\nparameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of\nJ/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading\ntwist gluon shadowing is found to be vanishingly small. A novel mechanism of\ndouble color filtering for c-cbar dipoles makes nuclei significantly more\ntransparent in AA compared to pA collisions. This is one of the mechanisms\nwhich make impossible a model independent \"data driven\" extrapolation from pA\nto AA. This effect also explains the enhancement of nuclear suppression\nobserved at forward rapidities in AA collisions at RHIC, what hardly can be\nrelated to the produced dense medium.

However, the inward migration of Saturn could be halted\nwhen Jupiter compresses the inner disk in which Saturn is embedded. (2)\nConvergent migration occurs when the initial separation is smaller (d<d_{iLr})\nand the density slope of the disk is nearly flat (\\alpha<1/2).

Hence, the selected\nmechanisms keep the sites bound to their designated regulators for most of the\ntime, thus minimizing fitness-reducing errors.

Coarse-grained\nmolecular models that capture key features of coupled aggregation and\nliquid-crystal ordering common to many different systems are lacking; in\nparticular, the role of monomer aspect ratio and aggregate flexibility in\ncontrolling the phase behavior are not well understood.

We used a grid of 116 stellar and 32 low-mass/brown\ndwarf models, a crude model of the merger process, and followed the angular\nmomentum evolution of the binary orbit and the primary's rotation prior to\nmerger, as well as the merged object's rotation after the merger. We find that\npresent-day merged objects that are observable as giant stars or core-helium\nburning stars in our model population constitute between 0.24% and 0.33% of the\ninitial population of ZAMS binaries, depending upon the input parameters\nchosen. The median projected rotational velocity of these merged objects is ~16\nkm/sec, an order of magnitude higher than the median projected rotational\nvelocity in a model population of normal single stars calculated using the same\nstellar models and initial mass function. The masses of the merged objects are\ntypically less than ~2 solar masses, with a median mass of 1.28 solar masses,\nwhich is slightly more than, but not significantly different from, their normal\nsingle star counterparts. The luminosities in our merged object population\nrange from ~10-100 solar luminosities, with a strong peak in the luminosity\ndistribution at ~60 solar luminosities, since the majority of the merged\nobjects (57%) lie on the horizontal branch at the present epoch.

The analysis of the two wing regimes\nshows that species like H2CO and CH3OH favor the low-velocity gas, while SiO\nand HCN are more abundant in the fastest gas.

This underscores that HI traces the gas\nreservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least\nlow level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere HI is observed. Whereas\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25.

This provides\nevidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately\nSalpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We\nargue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion\nor delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption\nthat the SFR depends on the local gas surface density.

In the present article, some of the subtleties\nunderlying the functional integral representation of the spin-boson and related\nmodels with spin anisotropy are discussed. To this end, an introduction to spin\ncoherent states and spin path integrals is presented with a focus on the\nspin-boson model. It is shown that, even for the Ising-anisotropic case as in\nthe spin-boson model, the path integral in the continuum limit in the coherent\nstate representation involves a Berry phase term. As a result, the effective\naction for the spin degrees of freedom does not assume the form of a\nGinzburg-Landau-Wilson functional. The implications of the Berry-phase term for\nthe quantum-critical behavior of the spin-boson model are discussed. The case\nof arbitrary spin is also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 20:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Quantities of particular\ninterest for many calculations are the Weyl scalar $\\psi_4$, which is simply\nrelated to the flux of gravitational waves far from the source, and the flux of\nenergy carried to distant observers, $\\dot E$. Conservation laws guarantee\nthat, in asympotically flat spacetimes, $\\psi_4 \\propto 1/r$ and $\\dot E\n\\propto 1/r^2$ as $r \\to \\infty$. Most calculations extract these quantities at\nsome finite extraction radius. An understanding of finite radius corrections to\n$\\psi_4$ and $\\dot E$ allows us to more accurately infer their asymptotic\nvalues from a computation. In this paper, we show that, if the final state of\nthe system is a black hole, then the leading correction to $\\psi_4$ is ${\\cal\nO}(1/r^3)$, and that to the energy flux is ${\\cal O}(1/r^4)$ --- not ${\\cal\nO}(1/r^2)$ and ${\\cal O}(1/r^3)$ as one might naively guess. Our argument only\nrelies on the behavior of the curvature scalars for black hole spacetimes.\nUsing black hole perturbation theory, we calculate the corrections to the\nleading falloff, showing that it is quite easy to correct for finite extraction\nradius effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 00:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2010 18:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-09"}

The magnetic screening properties\nunder an axial DC magnetic field are characterized at several temperatures\nbelow the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). Two main shielding properties are\nstudied and compared with those of Bi-2223, a material that has been considered\nin the past for bulk magnetic shields. The first property is related to the\nmaximum magnetic flux density that can be screened, Blim; it is defined as the\napplied magnetic flux density below which the field attenuation measured at the\ncentre of the shield exceeds 1000. For a cylinder of Bi-2212 with a wall\nthickness of 5 mm and a large ratio of length over radius, Blim is evaluated to\n1 T at T = 10 K. This value largely exceeds the Blim value measured at the same\ntemperature on similar tubes of Bi-2223. The second shielding property that is\ncharacterized is the dependence of Blim with respect to variations of the sweep\nrate of the applied field, dBapp/dt. This dependence is interpreted in terms of\nthe power law E = Ec(J/Jc)^n and allows us to determine the exponent n of this\nE(J) characteristics for Bi-2212. The characterization of the magnetic field\nrelaxation involves very small values of the electric field. This gives us the\nopportunity to experimentally determine the E(J) law in an unexplored region of\nsmall electric fields.

Very high molecular D/H ratios have been found for\nsaturated molecules and ions. However, little is known about the deuterium\nfractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent an\nintermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. The\nimidogen radical NH is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesis\nin the gas phase. Herschel/HIFI represents a unique opportunity to study the\ndeuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observable\nfrom the ground. We searched here for the deuterated radical ND in order to\ndetermine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuteration\nmechanism of this species. We observed the solar-mass Class 0 protostar\nIRAS16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument HIFI as part of the Herschel key\nprogramme CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions). The\ndeuterated form of the imidogen radical ND was detected and securely identified\nwith 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorption\nagainst the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. The 3\ngroups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart NH were also\ndetected in absorption. We derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an\n[ND]/[NH] ratio of between 30 and 100%. The deuterium fractionation of imidogen\nis of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggests\nthat an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. We discuss two\npossible formation pathways for ND, by means of either the reaction of N+ with\nHD, or deuteron/proton exchange with NH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 12:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

In this method, the distribution functions for electrons and ions are\nFourier transformed in velocity space, and the resulting set of equations are\nsolved numerically. In the original Vlasov equation, phase mixing may lead to\nan oscillatory behavior and sharp gradients of the distribution function in\nvelocity space, which is problematic in simulations where it can lead to\nunphysical electric fields and instabilities and to the recurrence effect where\nparts of the initial condition recur in the simulation. The particle\ndistribution function is in general smoother in the Fourier transformed\nvelocity space, which is desirable for the numerical approximations. By\ndesigning outflow boundary conditions in the Fourier transformed velocity\nspace, the highest oscillating terms are allowed to propagate out through the\nboundary and are removed from the calculations, thereby strongly reducing the\nnumerical recurrence effect. The outflow boundary conditions in higher\ndimensions including electromagnetic effects are discussed.

We are able to present usefully accurate results for\nabout 20 of the lightest such states, for a range of l that begins close to the\n(finite volume) deconfining phase transition, and extends up to l.sqrt(K)~6\n(where K is the string tension). We find that most of these low-lying states\nare well described by the spectrum of the Nambu-Goto free string theory in flat\nspace-time. Remarkably, this is so not only at the larger values of l, where\nthe gap between the ground state energy and the low-lying excitations becomes\nsmall compared to the mass gap, but also down to much shorter lengths where\nthese excitation energies become large compared to sqrt(K), the flux-tube no\nlonger `looks' anything like a thin string, and an expansion of the effective\nstring action in powers of 1/l no longer converges. All this is for flux in the\nfundamental representation. We also calculate the k=2 (anti)symmetric ground\nstates and these show larger corrections at small l.

However, Jupiter's\ngaseous envelope is more massive and core may be less massive than those of\nSaturn. In order to account for this structural diversity and the super-solar\nmetallicity in the envelope of Jupiter and Saturn, we investigate the\npossibility that they may have either merged with other gas giants or consumed\nseveral Earth-mass proto-planetary embryos during or after the rapid accretion\nof their envelope.

Direct parabolic collisions also lead to the\ncoalescence of gas giants and merging of their cores. In these cases, the\nenergy released from the impact leads to vigorous convective motion throughout\nthe envelope and the erosion of the cores.

Models which\naccurately characterize this dependence are either too computationally complex\nto be useful or lack accuracy.

The stochastic heating, well\nknown from laboratory plasma physics where it has been confirmed in numerous\nexperiments, has been completely ignored in past studies of coronal heating.\nHowever, in the present study and in our very recent works it has been shown\nthat the inhomogeneous coronal plasma is, in fact, a perfect environment for\nfast growing drift waves. As a matter of fact, the large growth rates are\ntypically of the same order as the plasma frequency. The consequent heating\nrates may exceed the required values for a sustained coronal heating by several\norders of magnitude. Some aspects of these phenomena are investigated here. In\nparticular the analysis of the particle dynamics within the growing wave is\ncompared with the corresponding fluid analysis. While both of them predict the\nstochastic heating, the threshold for the heating obtained from the single\nparticle analysis is higher. The explanation for this effect is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 14:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These pairs finally end up\nas part of the relativistic magnetized wind emanating from the pulsar. The wind\nis slowed down, from its highly relativistic bulk motion, at a termination\nshock, which represents the reverse shock due to its interaction with the\nsurrounding ejecta of the progenitor supernova. At the (relativistic)\ntermination shock, acceleration of the pairs occurs, as part of the dissipation\nprocess, so that the cold wind is transformed into a plasma of relativistic\nnon-thermal particles, plus a potential thermal component, which however has\nnever been observed. As long as the pulsar wind is embedded in the supernova\nremnant these pairs are forced to escavate a bubble and lose energy\nadiabatically (because of the expansion) and radiatively (because of magnetic\nand radiation fields). We discuss here the observational constraints on the\nenergy and number content of such pairs and discuss the scenarios that may\nallow for the pairs to escape in the interstellar medium and possibly\ncontribute to the positron excess that has recently been detected by the PAMELA\nsatellite. Special attention is dedicated to the case of Pulsar Bow Shock\nNebulae. The pairs produced in these objects may be effectively carried out of\nthe Supernova Remnant and released in the Interstellar Medium. As a result, Bow\nShock Pulsar Wind Nebulae might be the main contributors to the positron excess\nin the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 15:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-28"}

The data term,\n\\emph{i.e}., the density of the observed backscattered signal given the region,\nis modeled by a finite mixture of Gamma densities with a given predefined\nnumber of components. To estimate the parameters of the class conditional\ndensities, a new expectation maximization algorithm was developed. The prior is\na multi-level logistic Markov random field enforcing local continuity in a\nstatistical sense. The smoothness parameter controlling the degree of\nhomogeneity imposed on the scene is automatically estimated, by computing the\nevidence with loopy belief propagation; the classical coding and least squares\nfit methods are also considered. The maximum a posteriori segmentation is\ncomputed efficiently by means of recent graph-cut techniques, namely the\n$\\alpha$-Expansion algorithm that extends the methodology to an optional number\nof classes. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is illustrated with\nsimulated images and real ERS and Envisat scenes containing oil spills.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 17:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-29"}

Taking\ninto account the quantum effects, the semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking\ntemperature and the area law are obtained, which are then used in the first law\nof thermodynamics to evaluate corrections to these quantities. It is\ninteresting to mention here that these corrections reduce to the corresponding\ncorrections for the Schwarzschild black hole when the charge $e=0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 04:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
