The latter returns\nanswers one by one before computing them all, which in principle is better if\nonly one answer (or a subset of the answers) is desired.\n  Batched evaluation is closer to SLD evaluation in that it computes solutions\nlazily as they are demanded, but it may need arbitrarily more memory than local\nevaluation, which is able to reclaim memory sooner. Some programs which in\npractice can be executed under the local strategy quickly run out of memory\nunder batched evaluation. This has led to the general adoption of local\nevaluation at the expense of the more depth-first batched strategy.\n  In this paper we study the reasons for the high memory consumption of batched\nevaluation and propose a new scheduling strategy which we have termed swapping\nevaluation. Swapping evaluation also returns answers one by one before\ncompleting a tabled call, but its memory usage can be orders of magnitude less\nthan batched evaluation.

This conjecture deals with the question whether Maximum Parsimony trees\nare hereditary. The conjecture suggests that a Maximum Parsimony tree for a\nparticular (DNA) alignment necessarily has subtrees of all possible sizes which\nare most parsimonious for the corresponding subalignments. We answer the\nconjecture affirmatively for binary alignments on five taxa but also show how\nto construct examples for which Maximum Parsimony trees are not hereditary.\nApart from showing that a most parsimonious tree cannot generally be reduced to\na most parsimonious tree on fewer taxa, we also show that compatible most\nparsimonious quartets do not have to provide a most parsimonious supertree.\nLast, we show that our results can be generalized to Maximum Likelihood for\ncertain nucleotide substitution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 18:33:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2010 10:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-30"}

The main calculations in this work are based on\ngauge field ensembles generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations with the\nIwasaki action for the gluons and a domain-wall action for the sea quarks.\nLattice spacing values of approximately 0.08 fm and 0.11 fm are used, and\nsimultaneous chiral extrapolations to the physical pion mass are performed. As\na test for gluon discretization errors, the calculations are repeated on two\nensembles generated by the MILC collaboration with the Luscher-Weisz gauge\naction. Gluon discretization errors are also studied in a lattice potential\nmodel using perturbation theory for four different gauge actions. The\nnonperturbative lattice QCD results for the radial and orbital bottomonium\nenergy splittings obtained from the RBC/UKQCD ensembles are found to be in\nexcellent agreement with experiment. To get accurate results for spin\nsplittings, the spin-dependent order-v^6 terms are included in the NRQCD\naction, and suitable ratios are calculated such that most of the unknown\nradiative corrections cancel.

We demonstrate\nhow the protons, accelerated from near-critical density plasmas by laser pulses\nhaving relatively small power, reach energies which may be of interest for\nmedical applications. When an intense laser pulse interacts with near-critical\ndensity plasma it makes a channel both in the electron and then in the ion\ndensity. The propagation of a laser pulse through such a self-generated channel\nis connected with the acceleration of electrons in the wake of a laser pulse\nand generation of strong moving electric and magnetic fields in the propagation\nchannel. Upon exiting the plasma the magnetic field generates a quasi-static\nelectric field that accelerates and collimates ions from a thin filament formed\nin the propagation channel. Two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations show\nthat a 100 TW laser pulse tightly focused on a near-critical density target is\nable to accelerate protons up to energy of 250 MeV. Scaling laws and optimal\nconditions for proton acceleration are established considering the energy\ndepletion of the laser pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 18:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-23"}

Halpha is\nthe most commonly observed line profile due to its intensity, and it is highly\ndependent on the characteristics of the surrounding environment of these stars.\nOur aim is to analyze how the Halpha line profile is affected by the various\nparameters of our model which contains both the magnetospheric and disk wind\ncontributions to the Halpha flux. We used a dipolar axisymmetric stellar\nmagnetic field to model the stellar magnetosphere and a modified Blandford &\nPayne model was used in our disk wind region. A three-level atom with continuum\nwas used to calculate the required Hydrogen level populations. We use the\nSobolev approximation and a ray-by-ray method to calculate the integrated line\nprofile. Through an extensive study of the model parameter space, we have\ninvestigated the contribution of many of the model parameters on the calculated\nline profiles. Our results show that the Halpha line is strongly dependent on\nthe densities and temperatures inside the magnetosphere and the disk wind\nregion. The bulk of the flux comes, most of the time, from the magnetospheric\ncomponent for standard classical T Tauri stars parameters, but the disk wind\ncontribution becomes more important as the mass accretion rate, the\ntemperatures and densities inside the disk wind increase. We have also found\nthat most of the disk wind contribution to the Halpha line is emitted at the\ninnermost region of the disk wind.

Two\ncorrections, based on extensive testing of synthetic BALQSO spectra, are\napplied in order to estimate the intrinsic fraction of CIV BALQSOs. First, the\nprobability of an observed BALQSO spectrum being identified as such by our\nalgorithm is calculated as a function of redshift, signal-to-noise ratio and\nBAL properties. Second, the different completenesses of the SDSS target\nselection algorithm for BALQSOs and non-BAL quasars are quantified. Accounting\nfor these selection effects the intrinsic CIV BALQSO fraction is 41+/-5 per\ncent. Our analysis of the selection effects allows us to measure the dependence\nof the intrinsic CIV BALQSO fraction on luminosity and redshift. We find a\nfactor of 3.5+/-0.4 decrease in the intrinsic fraction from the highest\nredshifts, z~4.0, down to z~2.0. The redshift dependence implies that an\norientation effect alone is not sufficient to explain the presence of BAL\ntroughs in some but not all quasar spectra.

In the P edge-completion problem, the set F of edges is constrained\nto be disjoint from E; in the P edge-deletion problem, F is a subset of E; no\nconstraint is imposed on F in the P edge-edition problem. A number of\noptimization problems can be expressed in terms of graph modification problems\nwhich have been extensively studied in the context of parameterized complexity.\nWhen parameterized by the size k of the edge set F, it has been proved that if\nP is an hereditary property characterized by a finite set of forbidden induced\nsubgraphs, then the three P edge-modification problems are FPT.

These are responsible for the intimate connection between high\nand low-energy scale physics, and their key role in the mechanism of HTSC was\nconjectured very early on. More recently, the detection of quantum oscillations\nin high-magnetic field experiments on YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) has suggested the\nexistence of a Fermi surface of well-defined quasiparticles in underdoped\ncuprates, lending support to the alternative proposal that HTSC might emerge\nfrom a Fermi liquid across the whole cuprate phase diagram. Discriminating\nbetween these orthogonal scenarios hinges on the quantitative determination of\nthe elusive quasiparticle weight Z, over a wide range of hole-doping p. By\nmeans of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on in situ doped\nYBCO, and following the evolution of bilayer band-splitting, we show that the\noverdoped metal electronic structure (0.25<p<0.37) is in remarkable agreement\nwith density functional theory and the Z=2p/(p+1) mean-field prediction. Below\np~0.10-0.15, we observe the vanishing of the nodal quasiparticle weight Z_N;\nthis marks a clear departure from Fermi liquid behaviour and -- consistent with\ndynamical mean-field theory -- is even a more rapid crossover to the Mott\nphysics than expected for the doped resonating valence bond (RVB) spin liquid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 23:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Recently, a Cognitive\nRadio Cognitive Network (CRCN) patch for NS-2 simulator has proposed to support\nmulti-channel multi-interface capability in NS-2. In this tutorial, we consider\nhow to simulate a multi-channel multiinterface wireless network using the NS-2\nsimulator. This tutorial is trageted to the novice users who wants to\nunderstand the implementation of multi-channel multi-interface in NS-2. We take\nthe Cognitive Radio Cognitive Network (CRCN) patch for NS-2 simulator and\ndemonstrate broadcasting over multiple-channels in a multi-interface network\nsetting. In our seeting, node braodcasts the Hello packets to its neighbors.\nNeighboring nodes receive the Hello packets if and only if they are tuned to\nthe same channel. We demonstrate through example that the tuning of receivers\ncan be done in two fashions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 08:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 13:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

We therefore argue that to constrain the\nrelative locations of the TFRs of spiral and S0 galaxies, the same tracer and\nmeasure must be used for both samples. Using detailed near-infrared imaging and\nthe circular velocities of axisymmetric Jeans models of 14 nearby edge-on Sa-Sb\nspirals and 14 nearby edge-on S0s drawn from a range of environments, we find\nthat S0s lie on a TFR with the same slope as the spirals, but are on average\n0.53+/-0.15 mag fainter at Ks-band at a given rotational velocity. This is a\nsignificantly smaller offset than that measured in earlier studies of the S0\nTFR, which we attribute to our elimination of the bias associated with using\ndifferent rotation measures and our use of earlier type spirals as a reference.\nSince our measurement of the offset avoids systematic biases, it should be\npreferred to previous estimates. A spiral stellar population in which star\nformation is truncated would take ~1 Gyr to fade by 0.53 mag at Ks-band. If S0s\nare the products of a simple truncation of star formation in spirals, then this\nfinding is difficult to reconcile with the observed evolution of the spiral/S0\nfraction with redshift. Recent star formation could explain the observed lack\nof fading in S0s, but the offset of the S0 TFR persists as a function of both\nstellar and dynamical mass. We show that the offset of the S0 TFR could\ntherefore be explained by a systematic difference between the total mass\ndistributions of S0s and spirals, in the sense that S0s need to be smaller or\nmore concentrated than spirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 08:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2010 10:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The new method is developed from the previous Three Stage Period\nAnalysis (TSPA) method. Our improvements are the use of a sliding window in\nchoosing the modelled datasets, a criterion applied to select the best model\nfor each dataset and the computation of the time scale of change of the light\ncurve. We test the performance of CPS with simulated and real data. The CPS has\na much improved time resolution which allows us to better investigate fast\nevolution of stellar light curves. We can also separate between the cases when\nthe data is best described by periodic and aperiodic (e.g. constant brightness)\nmodels. We find, however, that the performance of the CPS has certain\nlimitations. It does not determine the correct model complexity in all cases,\nespecially when the underlying light curve is constant and the number of\nobservations too small. Also the sensitivity in detecting two close light curve\nminima is limited and it has a certain amount of intrinsic instability in its\nperiod estimation.

Some argue that the specific form of the code with its twenty\namino-acids might be a 'frozen accident' because of the overwhelming effects of\nany further change. Others see it as a consequence of primordial biochemical\npathways and their evolution. Here we examine a scenario in which evolution\ndrives the emergence of a genetic code by selecting for an amino-acid map that\nminimizes the impact of errors. We treat the stochastic mapping of codons to\namino-acids as a noisy information channel with a natural fitness measure.\nOrganisms compete by the fitness of their codes and, as a result, a genetic\ncode emerges at a supercritical transition in the noisy channel, when the\nmapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom. At the phase transition, a\nsmall expansion is valid and the emergent code is governed by smooth modes of\nthe Laplacian of errors. These modes are in turn governed by the topology of\nthe error-graph, in which codons are connected if they are likely to be\nconfused. This topology sets an upper bound - which is related to the classical\nmap-coloring problem - on the number of possible amino-acids. The suggested\nscenario is generic and may describe a mechanism for the formation of other\nerror-prone biological codes, such as the recognition of DNA sites by proteins\nin the transcription regulatory network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 13:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-26"}

We do this by describing particle motion via a\nseries of discrete, instantaneous acceleration events, or `endpoints', with\neach such event being treated as a source of emission. This method implicitly\nallows for particle creation/destruction, and is suited to direct numerical\nimplementation in either the time- or frequency-domains.

Using\nthis formulation, we are immediately able to answer outstanding questions\nregarding the phenomenology of radio emission from ultra-high-energy particle\ninteractions in both the Earth's atmosphere and the Moon. In particular, our\nformulation makes it apparent that the dominant emission component of the\nAskaryan Effect (coherent radio-wave radiation from high-energy particle\ncascades in dense media) comes from coherent `bremsstrahlung' from particle\nacceleration, rather than coherent Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 15:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2011 15:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 14:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

The molecular gas distributions are always coincident with\ndistributions of optically-obscuring dust that reveal tightly-wound spiral\nstructures in many cases. The ionised gas always approximately corotates with\nthe molecular gas, evidencing a link between these two gas components, yet star\nformation is not always the domi- nant ionisation source. The galaxies with\nless molecular gas tend to have [O III]/H{\\beta} emission-line ratios at high\nvalues not expected for star formation. Most E/S0s with molecular gas have\nyoung or intermediate age stellar populations based on optical colours,\nultraviolet colours and absorption linestrengths.

Thus the star\nformation process in E/S0s is not overwhelmingly different than in other\nstar-forming galaxies, although one of the more reliable tracers (24{\\mu}m)\npoints to a possible lower star-formation efficiency at a given gas surface\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 15:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

While\nnumerical-relativity simulations are necessary to simulate this process\naccurately, they are also computationally expensive and unable at present to\ncover the large space of possible parameters, which include the relative mass\nratio, the stellar compactness, and the black hole spin. To mitigate this and\nprovide a first reasonable coverage of the space of parameters, we have\ndeveloped a method for estimating the mass of the remnant torus from black\nhole-neutron star mergers. The toy model makes use of an improved relativistic\naffine model to describe the tidal deformations of an extended tri-axial\nellipsoid orbiting around a Kerr black hole and measures the mass of the\nremnant torus by considering which of the fluid particles composing the star\nare on bound orbits at the time of the tidal disruption. We tune the toy model\nby using the results of fully general-relativistic simulations obtaining\nrelative precisions of a few percent and use it to extensively investigate the\nspace of parameters. In this way we find that the torus mass is largest for\nsystems with highly spinning black holes, small stellar compactnesses, and\nlarge mass ratios. As an example, tori as massive as ~1.33 solar masses can be\nproduced for a very extended star with compactness of ~0.1 inspiralling around\na black hole with dimensionless spin equal to 0.85 and mass ratio of about 0.3.\nHowever, for a more astrophysically reasonable mass ratio of ~0.14 and a\ncanonical value of the stellar compactness of ~0.145, the toy model sets a\nconsiderably smaller upper limit to the torus mass of less than ~0.34 solar\nmasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 15:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2010 19:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Several authors since then criticised the\nsuggestion. Convection may prevent grain sedimentation, and the embryos cannot\neven form so close to the parent star as cooling is too inefficient at these\ndistances. Here we reconsider the grain sedimentation process suggested by Boss\n(1998) but inside an embryo formed, as expected in the light of the cooling\nconstraints, at R ~ 100 AU. Such embryos are much less dense and are also\ncooler. We make analytical estimates of the process and also perform simple\nspherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics simulations to test these ideas.\nWe find that convection in our models does not become important before a\nsomewhat massive (~ an Earth mass, this is clarified in a followup paper) solid\ncore is built. Turbulent mixing slows down dust sedimentation but is\noverwhelmed by grain sedimentation when the latter grow to a centimetres size.\nThe minimum time required for dust sedimentation to occur is a few thousand\nyears, and is a strong function of the embryo's mass, dust content and opacity.\nAn approximate analytical criterion is given to delineate conditions in which a\ngiant embryo contracts and heats up faster than dust can sediment. As Boss et\nal (2002), we argue that core formation through grain sedimentation inside the\ngiant planet embryos may yield an unexplored route to form giant gas and giant\nice planets. The present model also stands at the basis of paper III, where we\nstudy the possibility of forming terrestrial planet cores by tidal disruption\nand photoevaporation of the planetary envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 15:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

If conditions are conducive\nto solid core formation, the centre of the gas cloud goes through the following\nsequence of phases: (i) becomes grain (and metal) rich; (ii) forms a\nterrestrial mass solid core via a rapid collapse driven by self-gravity of the\ngrains; (iii) starts to accrete a gaseous atmosphere when the solid core\nreaches mass of a few to 10 Earth masses.
