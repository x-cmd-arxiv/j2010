These upper bounds on the deviation from\nantipodicity demonstrate that in a flat universe for some classes of topology\nthere remains a substantial fraction of observers for whom the deviation from\nantipodicity of the matching circles is considerably larger than zero, which\nimplies that the searches for circles-in-the-sky undertaken so far are not\nenough to exclude the possibility of a detectable non-trivial flat topology.\nHere we briefly review these results and discuss their consequences in the\nsearch for circles-in-the-sky in a flat universes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 17:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-21"}

With a\nfaithful parameterization of the beam shape, we can constrain certain detector\nproperties, such as the time constants of the detectors, to high precision.\nAlternatively, we decompose the beam using an orthogonal basis.

Here we report on our\nstudy of the topographic structure of free-standing CMG using atomic force\nmicroscopy and electron diffraction. We find that, unlike graphene, suspended\nsheets of CMG are corrugated and distorted on nanometre length scales. AFM\nreveals not only long range (100 nm) distortions induced by the support, as\npreviously observed for graphene, but also short-range corrugations with length\nscales down to the resolution limit of 10 nm. These corrugations are static not\ndynamic, and are significantly diminished on CMG supported on atomically smooth\nsubstrates. Evidence for even shorter range distortions, down to a few\nnanometres or less, is found by electron diffraction of suspended CMG.\nComparison of the experimental data with simulations reveals that the mean\natomic displacement from the nominal lattice position is of order 10% of the\ncarbon-carbon bond length. Taken together, these results suggest a complex\nstructure for chemically modified graphene where heterogeneous\nfunctionalisation creates local strain and distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 18:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-12"}

In this regime, HI is likely to represent most of the ISM\nand FUV emission to trace recent star formation with little bias due to\nextinction, so that the two quantities closely trace the underlying\nrelationship between gas and star formation rate (SFR).

The latter structure, predicted\nby several models of the disruption of Sgr dSph, was never traced before;\ncomparison with existing models indicates that the difference in distance\nbetween these portions of the leading and trailing arms may provide a powerful\ntool to discriminate between theoretical models assuming different shapes of\nthe Galactic potential. A further, more distant wrap in the same portion of the\nsky is detected only along a couple of lines of sight.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 20:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These\ncorrelations strengthen the cold feedback mechanism that is thought to operate\nin cooling flow clusters and during galaxy formation. In the cold feedback\nmechanism the central super-massive black hole (SMBH) is fed with cold clumps\nthat originate in an extended region of the cooling flow volume, in particular\nfrom the inner region that has a flat entropy profile. Such a process ensures a\ntight feedback between radiative cooling and heating by the SMBH (the AGN).

The definition of Hybrid MKNF is parametric on the description\nlogic (DL) underlying the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic\nrules can extend any decidable DL language. Two related semantics have been\ndefined for Hybrid MKNF: one that is based on the Stable Model Semantics for\nlogic programs and one on the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS). Under WFS, the\ndefinition of Hybrid MKNF relies on a bottom-up computation that has polynomial\ndata complexity whenever the DL language is tractable. Here we define a general\nquery-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF that is sound with respect to the stable\nmodel-based semantics, and sound and complete with respect to its WFS variant.\nThis procedure is able to answer a slightly restricted form of conjunctive\nqueries, and is based on tabled rule evaluation extended with an external\noracle that captures reasoning within the ontology. Such an (abstract) oracle\nreceives as input a query along with knowledge already derived, and replies\nwith a (possibly empty) set of atoms, defined in the rules, whose truth would\nsuffice to prove the initial query. With appropriate assumptions on the\ncomplexity of the abstract oracle, the general procedure maintains the data\ncomplexity of the WFS for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.\n  To illustrate this approach, we provide a concrete oracle for EL+, a fragment\nof the light-weight DL EL++. Such an oracle has practical use, as EL++ is the\nlanguage underlying OWL 2 EL, which is part of the W3C recommendations for the\nSemantic Web, and is tractable for reasoning tasks such as subsumption. We show\nthat query-driven Hybrid MKNF preserves polynomial data complexity when using\nthe EL+ oracle and WFS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 21:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2011 17:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-12"}

Close groupings, like the cores of galaxy clusters or compact\ngroups, evolve in ways far more dramatic than their isolated counterparts. We\nhave conducted a multiwavelength study of HCG7, consisting of four giant\ngalaxies: 3 spirals and 1 lenticular. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nimaging to identify and characterize the young and old star cluster\npopulations. We find young massive clusters (YMC) mostly in the three spirals,\nwhile the lenticular features a large, unimodal population of globular clusters\n(GC) but no detectable clusters with ages less than ~Gyr. The spatial and\napproximate age distributions of the ~300 YMCs and ~150 GCs thus hint at a\nregular star formation history in the group over a Hubble time. While at first\nglance the HST data show the galaxies as undisturbed, our deep ground-based,\nwide-field imaging that extends the HST coverage reveals faint signatures of\nstellar material in the intra-group medium. We do not detect the intra-group\nmedium in HI or Chandra X-ray observations, signatures that would be expected\nto arise from major mergers. We find that the HI gas content of the individual\ngalaxies and the group as a whole are a third of the expected abundance. The\nappearance of quiescence is challenged by spectroscopy that reveals an intense\nionization continuum in one galaxy nucleus, and post-burst characteristics in\nanother. Our spectroscopic survey of dwarf galaxy members yields one dwarf\nelliptical in an apparent tidal feature. We therefore suggest an evolutionary\nscenario for HCG7, whereby the galaxies convert most of their available gas\ninto stars without major mergers and result in a dry merger. As the conditions\ngoverning compact groups are reminiscent of galaxies at intermediate redshift,\nwe propose that HCGs are appropriate for studying galaxy evolution at z~1-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 21:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

Their formation requires the collapse of massive\ninterstellar gas clouds with very high accretion rates. We discuss results from\nthe first three-dimensional simulations of the gravitational collapse of a\nmassive, rotating molecular cloud core that include heating by both\nnon-ionizing and ionizing radiation. Local gravitational instabilities in the\naccretion flow lead to the build-up of a small cluster of stars. These\nlower-mass companions subsequently compete with the high-mass star for the same\ncommon gas reservoir and limit its overall mass growth. This process is called\nfragmentation-induced starvation, and explains why massive stars are usually\nfound as members of high-order stellar systems. These simulations also show\nthat the HII regions forming around massive stars are initially trapped by the\ninfalling gas, but soon begin to fluctuate rapidly. Over time, the same\nultracompact HII region can expand anisotropically, contract again, and take on\nany of the observed morphological classes. The total lifetime of HII regions is\ngiven by the global accretion timescale, rather than their short internal\nsound-crossing time. This solves the so-called lifetime problem of ultracompact\nHII region. We conclude that the the most significant differences between the\nformation of low-mass and high-mass stars are all explained as the result of\nrapid accretion within a dense, gravitationally unstable flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2010 22:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The Lagrangian parameters are\ntaken to be the same inside and outside the PNR, with exception of the\nsoft-mode gap temperature dependence. The interaction of the Transverse (TO)\nwith the longitudinal (LO) optic modes is taken into account but the latter is\nfound to be important only at the surface of the PNR. Elementary excitations of\nthe system are found to be of two types - Vortex (V) and Quasi Polar (QP). V\nexcitations correspond to closed polarization lines or closed TO displacements\nwhile QP excitations contain open TO polarization lines, with an electric\ndipole if the net angular momentum j=1. LO waves are virtually excited only in\nthe thin layer near the PNR surface and can be excluded from the boundary\nconditions without any consequence. The final boundary conditions include only\nV and QP TO wave amplitudes. Dynamical equations are solved and a phase diagram\nis predicted.

The lasso or the elastic net\npenalized manifold learning based dimensionality reduction is not directly a\nlasso penalized least square problem and thus the least angle regression (LARS)\n(Efron et al. \\cite{LARS}), one of the most popular algorithms in sparse\nlearning, cannot be applied. Therefore, most current approaches take indirect\nways or have strict settings, which can be inconvenient for applications. In\nthis paper, we proposed the manifold elastic net or MEN for short. MEN\nincorporates the merits of both the manifold learning based dimensionality\nreduction and the sparse learning based dimensionality reduction. By using a\nseries of equivalent transformations, we show MEN is equivalent to the lasso\npenalized least square problem and thus LARS is adopted to obtain the optimal\nsparse solution of MEN. In particular, MEN has the following advantages for\nsubsequent classification: 1) the local geometry of samples is well preserved\nfor low dimensional data representation, 2) both the margin maximization and\nthe classification error minimization are considered for sparse projection\ncalculation, 3) the projection matrix of MEN improves the parsimony in\ncomputation, 4) the elastic net penalty reduces the over-fitting problem, and\n5) the projection matrix of MEN can be interpreted psychologically and\nphysiologically. Experimental evidence on face recognition over various popular\ndatasets suggests that MEN is superior to top level dimensionality reduction\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 05:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 03:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2010 03:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-28"}

However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective\naction has not been determined.

Using systems level information of the apoptotic signalling\nreactions we have developed a quantitative model of neuroglobin inhibition of\napoptosis, which simulates neuroglobin blocking of apoptosome formation at a\nsingle cell level. Furthermore, this model allows us to explore the effect of\nneuroglobin in conditions not easily accessible to experimental study. We found\nthat the protection of neurons by neuroglobin is very concentration sensitive.\nThe impact of neuroglobin may arise from both its binding to cytochrome c and\nits subsequent redox reaction, although the binding alone is sufficient to\nblock pro-caspase 9 activation. These data provides an explanation the action\nof neuroglobin in the protection of nerve cells from unwanted apoptosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 06:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}

The first measurement of\na metal abundance in the IGM at a redshift approaching the epoch of\nreionization already offers intriguing hints. Between z=5.8 and 4.7 (a 0.3 Gyr\ninterval only 1 Gyr after the big bang), the measured density of CIV absorbers\nin the IGM increased by a factor of ~ 3.5 (Ryan-Weber et al. 2009; Becker,\nRauch & Sargent 2009).

Here, there is an attempt of\nformulating a second gradient Biot like model for porous materials. In\nparticular the interest is focused in describing the local dilatant behaviour\nof a porous material induced by pore opening elastic and capillary interaction\nphenomena among neighbouring pores and related micro-filtration phenomena by\nmeans of a continuum microstructured model. The main idea is to extend the\nclassical macroscopic Biot model by including in the description second\ngradient effects. This is done by assuming that the surface contribution to the\nexternal work rate functional depends on the normal derivative of the velocity\nor equivalently assuming that the strain work rate functional depends on the\nporosity and strain gradients. According to classical thermodynamics suitable\nrestrictions for stresses and second gradient internal actions (hyperstresses)\nare recovered, so as to determine a suitable extended form of the constitutive\nrelation and Darcy's law. Finally a numerical application of the envisaged\nmodel to one-dimensional consolidation is developed; the obtained results\ngeneralize those by Terzaghi; in particular interesting phenomena occurring\nclose to the consolidation external surface and the impermeable wall can be\ndescribed, which were not accounted for previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 09:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}

An instance of this problem consists of a matrix\n$A \\in [0,1]^{m \\times n}$, a vector $b \\in [1,\\infty)^m$, and a monotone\nsubmodular set function $f: 2^{[n]} \\rightarrow \\bbR_+$. The objective is to\nfind a set $S$ that maximizes $f(S)$ subject to $A x_{S} \\leq b$, where $x_S$\nstands for the characteristic vector of the set $S$. A well-studied special\ncase of this problem is when $f$ is linear. This special case captures the\nclass of packing integer programs.\n  Our main contribution is an efficient combinatorial algorithm that achieves\nan approximation ratio of $\\Omega(1 / m^{1/W})$, where $W = \\min\\{b_i / A_{ij}\n: A_{ij} > 0\\}$ is the width of the packing constraints. This result matches\nthe best known performance guarantee for the linear case. One immediate\ncorollary of this result is that the algorithm under consideration achieves\nconstant factor approximation when the number of constraints is constant or\nwhen the width of the constraints is sufficiently large. This motivates us to\nstudy the large width setting, trying to determine its exact approximability.\nWe develop an algorithm that has an approximation ratio of $(1 - \\epsilon)(1 -\n1/e)$ when $W = \\Omega(\\ln m / \\epsilon^2)$. This result essentially matches\nthe theoretical lower bound of $1 - 1/e$. We also study the special setting in\nwhich the matrix $A$ is binary and $k$-column sparse. A $k$-column sparse\nmatrix has at most $k$ non-zero entries in each of its column.

While the most common maximum a posteriori (MAP), or\nViterbi, path estimator and the minimum error, or Posterior Decoder (PD), have\nlong been around, other path estimators, or decoders, have been either only\nhinted at or applied more recently and in dedicated applications generally\nunfamiliar to the statistical learning community. Over a decade ago, however, a\nfamily of algorithmically defined decoders aiming to hybridize the two standard\nones was proposed (Brushe et al., 1998). The present paper gives a careful\nanalysis of this hybridization approach, identifies several problems and issues\nwith it and other previously proposed approaches, and proposes practical\nresolutions of those. Furthermore, simple modifications of the classical\ncriteria for hidden path recognition are shown to lead to a new class of\ndecoders. Dynamic programming algorithms to compute these decoders in the usual\nforward-backward manner are presented. A particularly interesting subclass of\nsuch estimators can be also viewed as hybrids of the MAP and PD estimators.\nSimilar to previously proposed MAP-PD hybrids, the new class is parameterized\nby a small number of tunable parameters. Unlike their algorithmic predecessors,\nthe new risk-based decoders are more clearly interpretable, and, most\nimportantly, work \"out of the box\" in practice, which is demonstrated on some\nreal bioinformatics tasks and data. Some further generalizations and\napplications are discussed in conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 11:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 16:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 16:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2013 11:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

In\nvarious experimental setups it is reasonably straightforward to reconstruct the\nstate of a quantum system employing linear tomographic technique. In this way\nthe elements of the density matrix can be linearly related to a set of measured\nquantities. But since different observables of a quantum system are not\ncommuting with each other, one often has to perform series of successive\nmeasurements of observables which cannot be done simultaneously.

Consider a fully connected $n$-user Gaussian interference channel. At\neach time instance only $K\\leq n$ transmitters are allowed to be communicating\nwith their respective receivers and the remaining $(n-K)$ transmitter-receiver\npairs remain inactive. For finite $n$, if the transmitters can acquire channel\nstate information (CSI) and if all channel gains are bounded away from zero and\ninfinity, the seminal results on interference alignment establish that for any\n$K$ {\\em arbitrary} active pairs the total number of spatial degrees of freedom\nper orthogonal time and frequency domain is $\\frac{K}{2}$. Also it is\nnoteworthy that without transmit-side CSI the interference channel becomes\ninterference-limited and the degrees of freedom is 0. In {\\em dense} networks\n($n\\rightarrow\\infty$), however, as the size of the network increase, it\nbecomes less likely to sustain the bounding conditions on the channel gains. By\nexploiting this fact, we show that when $n$ obeys certain scaling laws, by {\\em\nopportunistically} and {\\em dynamically} selecting the $K$ active pairs at each\ntime instance, the number of degrees of freedom can exceed $\\frac{K}{2}$ and in\nfact can be made arbitrarily close to $K$.

Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for\ncollective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while\nhigh-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to\nrelatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental\nframework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social\ninteractions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities. We use active\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a\ndistributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the\ndynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three\nhigh-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in\ncommunity size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of\na characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association\nbetween the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting\nsuper-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining\nsuper-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections. Taking\nadvantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the\nmonitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way\nindividuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of\nsuper-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our\nunderstanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the\nspreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 15:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}

A promising theory of the dominant emission process is the coherent\nsynchrotron radiation emitted by e+ e- shower particles in the Earth's magnetic\nfield (geosynchrotron effect). A radio air shower detector can extend IceTop,\nthe air shower detector on top of IceCube. This could increase the sensitivity\nof IceTop to higher shower energies and for inclined showers significantly.\nMuons from air showers are a major part of the background of the neutrino\ntelescope IceCube. Thus a surface radio air shower detector could act as a veto\ndetector for this muonic background. Initial radio background measurements with\na single antenna in 2007 revealed a continuous electromagnetic background\npromising a low energy threshold of radio air shower detection. However, short\npulsed radio interferences can mimic real signals and have to be identified in\nthe frequency range of interest.
