The integers are then losslessly compressed\nusing the fast and efficient Rice algorithm and stored in a portable FITS\nformat file. Quantizing an image more coarsely gives greater image compression,\nbut it also increases the noise and degrades the precision of the photometric\nand astrometric measurements in the quantized image. Dithering the pixel values\nduring the quantization process can greatly improve the precision of\nmeasurements in the images.

Our numerical results\nshow that by optimizing the sensing-dependent inter-sensing times, our proposed\nscheme reduces the impact of sensing errors caused by false alarm and\nmisdetection and outperforms the case of a single sensing period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 17:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-08"}

The\nconfiguration model for uniformly sampling binary contingency tables proceeds\nas follows. First, label N=\\sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i tokens of type 1, arrange them in\nm cells, and let the i-th cell contain r_i tokens. Next, label another set of\ntokens of type 2 containing N=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_j elements arranged in n cells,\nand let the j-th cell contain c_j tokens. Finally, pair the type-1 tokens with\nthe type-2 tokens by generating a random permutation until the total pairing\ncorresponds to a binary contingency table. Generating one random permutation\ntakes O(N) time, which is optimal up to constant factors. A fundamental\nquestion is whether a constant number of permutations is sufficient to obtain a\nbinary contingency table. In the current paper, we solve this problem by\nshowing a necessary and sufficient condition so that the probability that the\nconfiguration model outputs a binary contingency table remains bounded away\nfrom 0 as N goes to \\infty.

Based on our adopted\nspin model, we find that the distribution of AGN power estimated from X-ray\ncavities is consistent with a broad range of both spin parameter and accretion\nrate. Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to\npower their AGN by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN\npower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a\ngiven AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the\nfraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN,\nboth vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in\nBCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus\nby the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot\natmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGN, unless their black holes\nare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply.

The observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,\nbut with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and the\nintegrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \\pm 0.17 K km/s. This detection of\nthermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of water\nin carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-rich\nAGB star, the first having been obtained by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy\nSatellite toward IRC+10216. For an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,\nthe observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) E-5 Earth\nmasses per year and a water abundance relative to H2 of ~ (2-5) E-6. This value\nis a factor of at least 1E+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance in\na carbon-rich environment, and - as in IRC+10216 - raises the intriguing\npossibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation of\norbiting comets or dwarf planets. However, observations of the single line\nobserved to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatial\ndistribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations of\nadditional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of the\nH2O-emitting zone, and the H2O ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to place\nimportant constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

For accurately measuring intensities and determining magnetic field\nstrengths of small-scale solar (magnetic) structure, knowledge of and\ncompensation for the point spread function is crucial. For images recorded with\nthe Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, restoration with Multi-Frame Blind\nDeconvolution and Joint Phase Diverse Speckle methods lead to remarkable\nimprovements in image quality but granulation contrasts that are too low,\nindicating additional stray light. Aims. We propose a method to compensate for\nstray light from high-order atmospheric aberrations not included in MFBD and\nJPDS processing. Methods. To compensate for uncorrected aberrations, a\nreformulation of the image restoration process is proposed that allows the\naverage effect of hundreds of high-order modes to be compensated for by relying\non Kolmogorov statistics for these modes. The applicability of the method\nrequires simultaneous measurements of Fried's parameter r0. The method is\ntested with simulations as well as real data and extended to include\ncompensation for conventional stray light. Results. We find that only part of\nthe reduction of granulation contrast in SST images is due to uncompensated\nhigh-order aberrations. The remainder is still unaccounted for and attributed\nto stray light from the atmosphere, the telescope with its re-imaging system\nand to various high-altitude seeing effects. Conclusions. We conclude that\nstatistical compensation of high-order modes is a viable method to reduce the\nloss of contrast occurring when a limited number of aberrations is explicitly\ncompensated for with MFBD and JPDS processing. We show that good such\ncompensation is possible with only 10 recorded frames. The main limitation of\nthe method is that already MFBD and JPDS processing introduces high-order\ncompensation that, if not taken into account, can lead to over-compensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

During this 11 months period, the source was\ncharacterized by a complex variability at optical, UV and gamma-ray bands, on\ntime scales down to 6-12 hours. The brightest gamma-ray isotropic luminosity,\nrecorded on 2009 March 26, was ~ 2x10^48erg s^-1. The spectrum in the Fermi-LAT\nenergy range shows a mild curvature well described by a log-parabolic law, and\ncan be understood as due to the Klein-Nishina effect. The gamma-ray flux has a\ncomplex correlation with the other wavelengths. There is no correlation at all\nwith the X-ray band, a weak correlation with the UV, and a significant\ncorrelation with the optical flux. The gamma-ray flux seems to lead the optical\none by about 13 days. From the UV photometry we estimated a black hole mass of\n~ 5.4x10^8 solar masses, and an accretion rate of ~ 0.5 solar masses/year.\nAlthough the power in the thermal and non-thermal outputs is smaller compared\nto the very luminous and distant flat spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089\nexhibits a quite large Compton dominance and a prominent big blue bump (BBB) as\nobserved in the most powerful gamma-ray quasars. The BBB was still prominent\nduring the historical maximum optical state in 2009 May, but the optical/UV\nspectral index was softer than in the quiescent state.

We model the broadband spectrum assuming a leptonic\nscenario in which the inverse Compton emission is dominated by the scattering\nof soft photons produced externally to the jet. The resulting model-dependent\njet energetic content is compatible with the accretion disk powering the jet,\nwith a total efficiency within the Kerr black hole limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The rms in the brightness temperature\nmeasured for the B68 and L1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mK, respectively, in a\nvelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. The continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mK in B68 and\n11.4+/-0.4 mK in L1544. No significant feature is detected in B68 and the 3\nsigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-H2O N(o-H2O) <\n2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-H2O) < 1.3x10^-9, more than an\norder of magnitude lower than the SWAS upper limit on this source. The L1544\nspectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtain\nthe first value of the o-H2O column density ever measured in dark clouds:\nN(o-H2O) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. The corresponding fractional abundance is\nx(o-H2O) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii > 7000 AU and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. The\nradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-H2O)\nprofile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where both\nfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. Herschel has provided the\nfirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. Prestellar cores such as\nL1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and large\nenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vapor\nbalance of water in molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2010 20:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

This lack of\nconstraint has previously led to controversy regarding the most appropriate set\nof parameters, as different assumptions on the value of turbulent diffusivity\nlead to radically different solar cycle predictions. Typically, the dynamo\ncommunity uses double step diffusivity profiles characterized by low values of\ndiffusivity in the bulk of the convection zone. However, these low diffusivity\nvalues are not consistent with theoretical estimates based on mixing-length\ntheory -- which suggest much higher values for turbulent diffusivity. To make\nmatters worse, kinematic dynamo simulations cannot yield sustainable magnetic\ncycles using these theoretical estimates. In this work we show that magnetic\ncycles become viable if we combine the theoretically estimated diffusivity\nprofile with magnetic quenching of the diffusivity. Furthermore, we find that\nthe main features of this solution can be reproduced by a dynamo simulation\nusing a prescribed (kinematic) diffusivity profile that is based on the\nspatiotemporal geometric-average of the dynamically quenched diffusivity. Here,\nwe provide an analytic fit to the dynamically quenched diffusivity profile,\nwhich can be used in kinematic dynamo simulations.

We carry out a\ndetailed analysis of codimension > 2 models employing gauge invariant variables\nin a flat background approximation. It is argued that using instead a curved\nbackground sourced by the brane would not resolve the ghost issue, unless a\nvery specific condition is satisfied (if satisfiable at all). As for other\nproperties of the model, from an explicit analysis of the 4-dimensional\ngraviton propagator we extract a mass, a decay width and a momentum dependent\nmodification of the gravitational coupling for the spin 2 mode. In the flat\nspace approximation, the mass of the problematic spin 0 ghost is instrumental\nin filtering out a brane cosmological constant. The mass replaces a background\ncurvature that would have had the same function.

One of\nthe striking advantages of this theory to other existing methods is that is\ndoes not use the concept of p-adic completions and we can dispense of Cardano's\nformulae. Another key result comprises the construction of cubic function\nfields of unit rank 1 and 2, with an obvious fundamental system. One of the\nmain ingredients for such constructions is the definition of the maximum value.\nThis definition is new and very prolific in the context of finding fundamental\nsystems. We conclude the thesis with miscellaneous results on the divisor class\nnumber h, including a new approach for finding divisors of h.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 09:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-09"}

We use a host-parasite model with\ntwo-sexes and the techniques of adaptive dynamics to investigate how mating\nsystem and sexual differences in competitive ability and longevity can select\nfor a bias in the rates of parasitism. Male-biased parasitism is selected for\nwhen males have a shorter average lifespan or when males are subject to greater\ncompetition for resources. Male-biased parasitism evolves as a consequence of\nsexual differences in life history that produce a greater proportion of\nsusceptible females than males and therefore reduce the cost of avoiding\nparasitism in males. Different mating systems such as monogamy, polygamy or\npolyandry did not produce a bias in parasitism through these ecological\nfeedbacks but may accentuate an existing bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 09:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-09"}

It associates to every bosonic degree of freedom a fermionic one and\nvice versa. Supersymmetry unifies the coupling constants of the\nelectromagnetic, weak and strong forces at a high scale and provides a\ncandidate for the elusive dark matter. Supersymmetry could be discovered at the\nLHC, the proton--proton collider at CERN which has started operations in 2008.\nThe LHC is foreseen to have a center--of--mass energy of 14~TeV, opening up a\nnew mass range to be explored to search for supersymmetric particles with the\nATLAS and CMS experiments. The development and production of electronics for\nthese detectors has been a challenge, e.g. for the readout board for the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter. Reconstructing the physics events with the best\nprecision, in particular the reconstruction and identification of electrons and\nphotons in the large QCD background has been prepared in extensive test beam\nstudies and Monte Carlo simulations. If the Higgs boson and supersymmetry are\ndiscovered, the properties of the (s)particles such as the masses, branching\nratios must be measured precisely, either at the LHC or at a future e+e- linear\ncollider. The SFitter project aims to determine the underlying theoretical\nmodel parameters from the correlated experimental measurements including\ntheoretical errors. The methods are applied to the extraction of the\nfundamental parameters of supersymmetry as well the measurement of the Higgs\nboson couplings at the LHC. The extrapolation of the supersymmetric parameters\nfrom the weak scale to the Grand Unification Scale could provide the basis\ntowards the inclusion of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 09:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-09"}

Deterministic finite automata are the simplest\ndevices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic Buchi, Co-Buchi, and\nparity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \\omega-regular\nlanguages. While it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite\nand weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic Buchi\nand parity automata has remained an open challenge. We establish the\nNP-completeness of these problems. A second contribution of this report is the\nintroduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. Like\nhyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the\nlanguage of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a\nmonitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a\nsystem. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation,\nrelaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi)\nautomata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective\nequivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we\nallow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be\nconsidered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation\nfrom the perspective of finite automata. From the perspective of Buchi and\nCo-Buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that\nalso turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space\nreductions put on top of it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 10:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}

The\naim of LP decoding is to develop an algorithm which has error-correcting\nperformance similar to that of the Sum-Product (SP) decoding algorithm, while\nat the same time it should be amenable to mathematical analysis. The LP\ndecoding algorithm has also been extended to nonbinary linear codes by Flanagan\net al. However, the most important problem with LP decoding for both binary and\nnonbinary linear codes is that the complexity of standard LP solvers such as\nthe simplex algorithm remain prohibitively large for codes of moderate to large\nblock length. To address this problem, Vontobel et al. proposed a low\ncomplexity LP decoding algorithm for binary linear codes which has complexity\nlinear in the block length. In this paper, we extend the latter work and\npropose a low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. We\nuse the LP formulation proposed by Flanagan et al. as a basis and derive a pair\nof primal-dual LP formulations. The dual LP is then used to develop the\nlow-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. In contrast to\nthe binary low-complexity LP decoding algorithm, our proposed algorithm is not\ndirectly related to the nonbinary SP algorithm. Nevertheless, the complexity of\nthe proposed algorithm is linear in the block length and is limited mainly by\nthe maximum check node degree. As a proof of concept, we also present a\nsimulation result for a $[80,48]$ LDPC code defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ using\nquaternary phase-shift keying over the AWGN channel, and we show that the\nerror-correcting performance of the proposed LP decoding algorithm is similar\nto that of the standard LP decoding using the simplex solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 13:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2010 16:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-05"}

In some species including humans, orientation\ncolumns are radially arranged around singular points like the spokes of a\nwheel, that are called pinwheels. The pinwheel structure has been observed\nfirst with optical imaging techniques and more recently by in vivo two-photon\nimaging proving their organization with single cell precision. In this research\nwe provide evidence that pinwheels are de facto optimal distributions for\ncoding at the best angular position and momentum. In the last years many\nauthors have recognized that the functional architecture of V1 is locally\ninvariant with respect to the symmetry group of rotations and translations\nSE(2). In the present study we show that the orientation cortical maps used to\nconstruct pinwheels can be modeled as coherent states, i.e. the configurations\nbest localized both in angular position and angular momentum. The theory we\nadopt is based on the well known uncertainty principle, introduced by\nHeisenberg in quantum mechanics and later extended to many other groups of\ninvariance. Here we state a corresponding principle in the cortical geometry\nwith SE(2) symmetry, and by computing its minimizers we obtain a model of\norientation activity maps in the cortex. As it is well known the pinwheels\nconfiguration is directly constructed from these activity maps, and we will be\nable to formally reproduce their structure starting from the group symmetries\nof the functional architecture of the visual cortex. The primary visual cortex\nis then modeled as an integrated system in which the set of simple cells\nimplements the SE(2) group, the horizontal connectivity implements its Lie\nalgebra and the pinwheels implement its minimal uncertainty states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 15:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-09"}

Motility assays of this small\nroundworm are designed to study the relationships between genes and behavior.\nCommonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and\ncharacterize them quantitatively. Over the past years, C. elegans' motility has\nbeen studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on\nsubstrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates.\nHowever, each environment often requires customized image processing tools\nrelying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel\nMulti-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image\nsegmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform\nis constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where\nstatistical models for both the background environment and the nematode\nappearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target\nnematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users;\nhere, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be\nprovided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction\nof nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test\nour algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with\nan intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the\nthreshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined.\nUltimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C.\nelegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility\nassays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2010 15:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
