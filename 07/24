The median value of the ratio between\nthe maximum disk rotational velocity and the intrinsic velocity dispersion for\nthe rotating objects is 1.6, much lower than observed in local galaxies value\n(~10) and slightly lower than the z~2 value (2 - 4).

During initial radiation-belt\npasses, the exposed ACIS suffered significant radiation damage from trapped\nsoft protons scattering off the x-ray telescope's mirrors. The primary effect\nof this damage was to increase the charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the\nACIS 8 front-illuminated CCDs. Subsequently, the Chandra team implemented\nprocedures to remove the ACIS from the telescope's focus during high-radiation\nevents: planned protection during radiation-belt transits; autonomous\nprotection triggered by an on-board radiation monitor; and manual intervention\nbased upon assessment of space-weather conditions. However, as Chandra's\nmultilayer insulation ages, elevated temperatures have reduced the\neffectiveness of the on-board radiation monitor for autonomous protection. Here\nwe investigate using the ACIS CCDs themselves as a radiation monitor.

We focus our attention on the\nbehaviour of the Carter constant (Q) for near-polar orbits; and develop an\nanalysis that is independent of and complements radiation reaction models. For\na Schwarzschild black hole, the polar orbits represent the abutment between the\nprograde and retrograde orbits at which Q is at its maximum value for given\nvalues of latus rectum (l) and eccentricity (e). The introduction of spin (S =\n|J|/M2) to the massive black hole causes this boundary, or abutment, to be\nmoved towards greater orbital inclination; thus it no longer cleanly separates\nprograde and retrograde orbits. To characterise the abutment of a Kerr black\nhole (KBH), we first investigated the last stable orbit (LSO) of a\ntest-particle about a KBH, and then extended this work to general orbits. To\ndevelop a better understanding of the evolution of Q we developed analytical\nformulae for Q in terms of l, e, and S to describe elliptical orbits at the\nabutment, polar orbits, and last stable orbits (LSO). By knowing the analytical\nform of dQ/dl at the abutment, we were able to test a 2PN flux equation for Q.\nWe also used these formulae to numerically calculate the di/dl of hypothetical\ncircular orbits that evolve along the abutment. From these values we have\ndetermined that di/dl = -(122.7S - 36S^3)l^-11/2 -(63/2 S + 35/4 S^3) l^-9/2\n-15/2 S l^-7/2 -9/2 S l^-5/2.

Despite indications that star formation activity\ndecreases with radius, the H2 excitation temperature and the ratio of the H2\nline and the far-IR luminosity surface densities, Sigma_L(H2}/Sigma_L(TIR},\nchange very little as a function of radius, even into the diffuse outer region\nof the disk of NGC 4565.

The\nlow temperature magnetic structure is defined by a spiral phase characterized\nby magnetic Bragg peaks at q=(0,0,tau ~ 1/7) onset at TN=27 K as previously\nreported by Marty et al. The nature of the fluctuations and temperature\ndependence of the order parameter is consistent with a classical second order\nphase transition for a two dimensional triangular antiferromagnet. We will show\nthat the physical properties and energy scales including the ordering\nwavevector, Curie-Weiss temperature, and the spin-waves can be explained\nthrough the use of only symmetric exchange constants without the need for the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This is accomplished through a set of\n``helical\" exchange pathways along the c direction imposed by the chiral\ncrystal structure and naturally explains the magnetic diffuse scattering which\ndisplays a strong vector chirality up to high temperatures well above the\nordering temperature. This illustrates a strong coupling between magnetic and\ncrystalline chirality in this compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 21:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A majority of the masers have been found to lack\nthe presence of any associated radio continuum. This could be due to the maser\nemission originating prior to the formation of an HII region around the central\nstar, or from the central object being too cool to produce a HII region. One\nway to distinguish between the two scenarios is to determine and model the\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the masers. We observed a sample of 20\n6.7 GHz methanol masers selected from the blind Arecibo survey, from centimeter\nto submillimeter wavelengths. We combined our observations with existing data\nfrom various Galactic plane surveys to determine SEDs from centimeter to\nnear-infrared wavelengths. We find that 70% of the masers do not have any\nassociated radio continuum, with the rest of the sources being associated with\nhypercompact and ultracompact HII regions. Modeling the SEDs shows them to be\nconsistent with rapidly accreting massive stars, with accretion rates well\nabove 10^{-3} M_sun/yr. The upper limits on the radio continuum are also\nconsistent with any ionized region being confined close to the stellar surface.\nThis confirms the paradigm of 6.7 GHz methanol masers being signposts of early\nphases of massive star formation, mostly prior to the formation of a\nhypercompact HII region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2010 22:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It was proposed that K-theory is behind the periodicity.\nOn the other hand, D-branes, a solitonic object in string theory, are also\nknown to be classified by K-theory. In this paper, by inspecting low-energy\neffective field theories realized by two parallel D-branes, we establish a\none-to-one correspondence between the K-theory classification of topological\ninsulators/superconductors and D-brane charges. In addition, the string theory\nrealization of topological insulators and superconductors comes naturally with\ngauge interactions, and the Wess-Zumino term of the D-branes gives rise to a\ngauge field theory of topological nature, such as ones with the Chern-Simons\nterm or the $\\theta$-term in various dimensions. This sheds light on\ntopological insulators and superconductors beyond non-interacting systems, and\nthe underlying topological field theory description thereof. In particular, our\nstring theory realization includes the honeycomb lattice Kitaev model in two\nspatial dimensions, and its higher-dimensional extensions. Increasing the\nnumber of D-branes naturally leads to a realization of topological insulators\nand superconductors in terms of holography (AdS/CFT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 00:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2010 05:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

Correspondingly, instead of monopole harmonics, the language of\nconventional Wigner $D$-functions is used, radial equations are founds in all\nthree models, and solved in the case of trivial W^{k}_{(triv)\\alpha} (x)$ in\nLobachevsky and Riemann models. In the particular case $W^{k}_{(triv)\\alpha}\n(x)$, the~doublet-monopole Hamiltonian is invariant under additional\none-para\\-metric group. This symmetry results in a freedom in choosing\na~discrete operator $\\hat{N}_{A}$ entering the complete set of quantum\nvariables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 07:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-27"}

In addition, the detection of strong line polarization in supernovae\nis suggestive of chemical inhomogeneities (\"clumps\") in the layers above the\nphotosphere, which may reflect hydrodynamical instabilities during the\nexplosion. We have developed a fast, flexible, approximate semi-analytic code\nfor modeling polarized line radiative transfer within 3-D inhomogeneous\nrapidly-expanding atmospheres. Given a range of model parameters, the code\ngenerates random sets of clumps in the expanding ejecta and calculates the\nemergent line profile and Stokes parameters for each configuration. The\nensemble of these configurations represents both the effects of various host\ngeometries and of different viewing angles. We present results for the first\npart of our survey of model geometries, specifically the effects of the number\nand size of clumps (and the related effect of filling factor) on the emergent\nspectrum and Stokes parameters. Our simulations show that random clumpiness can\nproduce line polarization in the range observed in SNe Ia (~1-2%), as well as\nthe Q-U loops that are frequently seen in all SNe. We have also developed a\nmethod to connect the results of our simulations to robust observational\nparameters such as maximum polarization and polarized equivalent width in the\nline.

The new formalism provides a\nvaluable ansatz to more elaborate (and computationally very demanding) full TD\nOEP and full TD SIC calculations especially in the linear domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 2010 15:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}
