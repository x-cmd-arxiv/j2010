A careful\nstudy in the magnetic properties has been carried out by the measurement of ac\nsusceptibility. The temperature range of CMR is greatly broadened with the\naddition of Fe. Substitution of Fe induces a gradual transition from a metallic\nferromagnetic with a high Curie temperature (Tc=270 K) to a ferromagnetic\ninsulator with low Tc=79 K. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with\nincreasing Fe content are evident. The variations in the critical temperature\nTc and magnetic moment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe\nis seen to be consistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due\nto the formation of magnetic clusters. An extra-ordinary behavior in the out of\nphase part (x\") of ac susceptibility, characterized by double bump (shoulder),\nwas observed around x=0.01 and 0.02. The shoulder in x\" disappears at x>0.04 Fe\nconcentration. With increasing Fe concentration the x\" peak shift to T<T1/2\n(mid point of the transition temperature) and becomes broader. The x\" peak\nmoves to 8 or 10 K higher temperature on the application of a dc field, for 3 &\n4% samples. We also see increasing low temperature dissipation in more strongly\nFe doped samples i.e. increasing the Fe, leads to increased spin disorder and\ndissipation at low temperature. The effect of the dc field is discussed in\nterms of the suppression of spin fluctuations close to Tc. The same ionic radii\nof Fe3+ and Mn3+ cause no structure changes in either series, yet\nferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by Fe doping.

The baryon deficiency is typically observed in the central regions of\nclusters (~0.5 the virial radius). However, the observed gas-density profile is\nsignificantly shallower than the mass-density profile, implying that the gas is\nmore extended than the mass and that the gas fraction increases with radius. We\nuse the observed density profiles of gas and mass in clusters to extrapolate\nthe measured baryon fraction as a function of radius and as a function of\ncluster mass. We find that the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value near\nthe virial radius for all groups and clusters above 5e13 solar masses. This\nsuggests that the baryons are not missing, they are simply located in cluster\noutskirts. Heating processes (shock-heating of the intracluster gas, plus\nsupernovae and AGN feedback) that cause the gas to expand are likely\nexplanations for these results. Upcoming observations should be able to detect\nthese baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 20:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

We also look for constraints on particle formation locations.\nOur results are based upon 1D disk models that evolve with time under the\naction of viscosity and photoevaporation, and track solid transport using an\nensemble of individual particle trajectories. We find that two classes of disk\nmodel are consistent with the Stardust findings. One class features a high\nparticle diffusivity (a Schmidt number Sc < 1), which suffices to diffuse\nparticles up to 20 microns in size outward against the mean gas flow. For Sc >\n1, such models are unlikely to be viable, and significant outward transport\nrequires that the particles of interest settle into a midplane layer that\nexperiences an outward gas flow. In either class of models, the mass of inner\ndisk material that reaches the outer disk is a strong function of the disk's\ninitial compactness. Hence, models of grain transport within steady-state disks\nunderestimate the efficiency of outward transport. Neither model results in\nsustained outward transport of very large particles exceeding a mm in size. We\nshow that the transport efficiency generally falls off rapidly with time.\nHence, high-temperature material must be rapidly incorporated into icy bodies\nto avoid fallback, and significant radial transport may only occur during the\ninitial phase of rapid disk evolution.

The three types of\ntheories suitable for describing the hysteresis loops of MNPs are presented and\ncompared to numerical simulations: equilibrium functions, Stoner-Wohlfarth\nmodel based theories (SWMBTs) and linear response theory (LRT). Suitable\nformulas to calculate the hysteresis area of major cycles are deduced from\nSWMBTs and from numerical simulations; the domain of validity of the analytical\nformula is explicitly studied. In the case of minor cycles, the hysteresis area\ncalculations are based on the LRT. A perfect agreement between LRT and\nnumerical simulations of hysteresis loops is obtained. The domain of validity\nof the LRT is explicitly studied. Formulas to calculate the hysteresis area at\nlow field valid for any anisotropy of the MNP are proposed. Numerical\nsimulations of the magnetic field dependence of the area show it follows\npower-laws with a large range of exponents. Then, analytical expressions\nderived from LRT and SWMBTs are used for a theoretical study of magnetic\nhyperthermia. It is shown that LRT is only pertinent for MNPs with strong\nanisotropy and that SWMBTs should be used for weak anisotropy MNPs. The optimum\nvolume of MNPs for magnetic hyperthermia as function of material and\nexperimental parameters is derived. The maximum specific absorption rate (SAR)\nachievable is calculated versus the MNP anisotropy. It is shown that an optimum\nanisotropy increases the SAR and reduces the detrimental effects of size\ndistribution. The optimum anisotropy is simple to calculate and depends on the\nmagnetic field used in the hyperthermia experiments and on the MNP\nmagnetization only. The theoretical optimum parameters are compared to the one\nof several magnetic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2010 23:50:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2010 13:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-25"}

We\nalso detect other absorption lines in these systems, including H I, C III, N V,\nO VI, and Si IV. Lower ionisation lines are not present, indicating a generally\nhigh degree of ionisation in all nine systems. The total hydrogen column\ndensities range from <=10^{17.2} to 10^{19.1}cm^{-2}. We examine several\ndiagnostics to estimate more directly the location and origin of each absorber.\nFour of the systems can be attributed to a quasar-driven outflow based on line\nprofiles that are smooth and broad compared to thermal line widths. Several\nsystems also have other indicators of a quasar outflow origin, including\npartial covering. Altogether there is direct evidence for 6 of the 9 systems\nforming in a quasar outflow.

In this paper we\nintroduce and explore a novel but general form of parameterization: the number\nof numbers. Several classic numerical problems, such as Subset Sum, Partition,\n3-Partition, Numerical 3-Dimensional Matching, and Numerical Matching with\nTarget Sums, have multisets of integers as input. We initiate the study of\nparameterizing these problems by the number of distinct integers in the input.\nWe rely on an FPT result for ILPF to show that all the above-mentioned problems\nare fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized in this way. In various\napplied settings, problem inputs often consist in part of multisets of integers\nor multisets of weighted objects (such as edges in a graph, or jobs to be\nscheduled). Such number-of-numbers parameterized problems often reduce to\nsubproblems about transition systems of various kinds, parameterized by the\nsize of the system description. We consider several core problems of this kind\nrelevant to number-of-numbers parameterization. Our main hardness result\nconsiders the problem: given a non-deterministic Mealy machine M (a finite\nstate automaton outputting a letter on each transition), an input word x, and a\ncensus requirement c for the output word specifying how many times each letter\nof the output alphabet should be written, decide whether there exists a\ncomputation of M reading x that outputs a word y that meets the requirement c.\nWe show that this problem is hard for W[1].

Using this sample we construct a catalog of 635 satellites\nassociated with 215 host galaxies whose spin directions are determined by our\ninspection of the SDSS color images and/or by spectroscopic observations in the\nliterature. We divide satellite galaxies into prograde and retrograde orbit\nsubsamples depending on their orbital motion respect to the spin direction of\nthe host. We find that the number of galaxies in prograde orbit is nearly equal\nto that of retrograde orbit galaxies: the fraction of satellites in prograde\norbit is 50+/-2%. The velocity distribution of satellites with respect to their\nhosts is found almost symmetric: the median bulk rotation of satellites is\n-1+/- 8 km/s. It is found that the radial distribution of early-type satellites\nin prograde orbit is strongly concentrated toward the host while that of\nretrograde ones shows much less concentration. We also find the orbital speed\nof late-type satellites in prograde orbit increases as the projected distance\nto the host (R) decreases while the speed decreases for those in retrograde\norbit. At R less than 0.1 times the host virial radius the orbital speed\ndecreases in both prograde and retrograde orbit cases. Prograde satellites are\non average fainter than retrograde satellites for both early and late\nmorphological types. The u-r color becomes redder as R decreases for both\nprograde and retrograde orbit late-type satellites.

The SEDs cover the rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths. We derive\nstellar masses, ages, color excesses, and star formation rates of five LAEs\nusing SED fitting method. Assuming the constant star formation history, we find\nthat the stellar masses range from 10^8 to $10^{10} Msun with the median value\nof 2.5x10^9 Msun. The derived ages range from very young ages (7.4 Myr) to 437\nMyr with a median age of 25 Myr. The color excess E(B-V) are between 0.1-0.4\nmag. Star formation rates are 55-209 Msun/yr. A comparison of the stellar\npopulations is made between three LAEs and 88 LBGs selected at the same\nredshift, in the same observed field, and down to the same limit of the\nrest-frame UV luminosity. These three LAEs are the brightest and reddest\nsamples among the whole LAE samples at z=4.86. The LAEs distribute at the\nrelatively faint part of UV-luminosity distribution of LBGs. Deriving the\nstellar properties of the LBGs by fitting their SEDs with the same model\nensures that model difference does not affect the comparison. It is found that\nthe stellar properties of the LAEs lie on distributions of those of LBGs. On\naverage, the LAEs show less dust extinction, and lower star formation rates\nthan LBGs, while the stellar mass of LAEs nearly lies in the middle part of the\nmass distribution of LBGs. However, the stellar properties of LAEs and LBGs are\nsimilar at the fixed UV or optical luminosity.

The sample covers both\nfield environments and the Virgo cluster. Our analysis shows that gas accretion\nplays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so for\nthose in clusters. For detection limits of a few times 10^6 Msun, HI is\ndetected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while <10% of the Virgo objects\nare detected. In about half of the detections, the HI forms a regularly\nrotating disc or ring. All HI discs have counterparts of ionised gas and inner\nHI discs are also detected in molecular gas. The cold ISM is dominated by\nmolecular gas (M_H2/M_HI ~ 10). We conclude that accretion of HI is common for\nfield early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usually\nsmall. Cluster galaxies appear not to accrete HI. The few galaxies with a\nsignificant young sub-population all have inner gas discs, but for the\nremaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and HI. Some\nearly-type galaxies are very gas rich, but only have an old population. The\nstellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those in\nVirgo. This is likely related to differences in accretion history. In about 50%\nof the galaxies we detect a central continuum source. In many objects this\nemission is from a low-luminosity AGN, in some it is consistent with the\nobserved star formation. Galaxies with HI in the central regions are more\nlikely detected in continuum. This is due to a higher probability for star\nformation to occur in such galaxies and not to HI-related AGN fuelling.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 09:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We shed light with these data on the physical\nproperties of the gas in the line of sight, emphasizing the still open debate\nabout the nature of the gas that produces the broad absorption line (~55 km/s).\nFirst, the broad H I line is more prominent toward the central and brightest 21\ncm continuum component than toward a region along the jet at a distance ~ 20\nmas (or 0.4 pc) further from it. This suggests that the broad absorption line\narises from gas located close to the nucleus, rather than from diffuse and more\ndistant gas. Second, the different velocity components detected in the CO(2-1)\nabsorption spectrum match well other molecular lines, such as those of\nHCO+(1-0), except the broad absorption line that is detected in HCO+(1-0) (and\nmost likely related to that of the H I).

Transversal components of the\nray's momentum have to be taken into account, which leads to a set of 3 coupled\ndifferential equations. It is shown that in a general Szekeres model, and in a\ngeneral Lema\\^{\\i}tre -- Tolman (L--T) model, generic light rays do not have\nrepeatable paths (RLPs): two rays sent from the same source at different times\nto the same observer pass through different sequences of intermediate matter\nparticles. The only spacetimes in the Szekeres class in which {\\em all} rays\nare RLPs are the Friedmann models. Among the proper Szekeres models, RLPs exist\nonly in the axially symmetric subcases, and in each one the RLPs are the null\ngeodesics that intersect each $t =$ constant space on the symmetry axis. In the\nspecial models with a 3-dimensional symmetry group (L--T among them), the only\nRLPs are radial geodesics. This shows that RLPs are very special and in the\nreal Universe should not exist.

Emission activity in the Halpha line of the BA supergiants Rigel\n(B8Ia) and Deneb (A2Ia) is indicative of presence of localized time-dependent\nmass ejections. Here, we employ optical interferometry to study the Halpha\nline-formation region in these stellar environments. High spatial- (0.001\narcsec) and spectral- (R=30 000) resolution observations of Halpha were\nobtained with the visible recombiner VEGA installed on the CHARA\ninterferometer, using the S1S2 array-baseline (34m). Six independent\nobservations were done on Deneb over the years 2008 and 2009, and two on Rigel\nin 2009. We analyze this dataset with the 1D non-LTE radiative-transfer code\nCMFGEN, and assess the impact of the wind on the visible and near-IR\ninterferometric signatures, using both Balmer-line and continuum photons. We\nobserve a visibility decrease in Halpha for both Rigel and Deneb, suggesting\nthat the line-formation region is extended (1.5-1.75 R*). We observe a\nsignificant visibility decrease for Deneb in the SiII6371 line. We witness time\nvariations in the differential phase for Deneb, implying an inhomogeneous and\nunsteady circumstellar environment, while no such variability is seen in\ndifferential visibilities. Radiative-transfer modeling of Deneb, with allowance\nfor stellar-wind mass loss, accounts fairly well for the observed decrease in\nthe Halpha visibility. Based on the observed differential visibilities, we\nestimate that the mass-loss rate of Deneb has changed by less than 5%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 12:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The framework, established by a series of easy-to-derive equivalences\nbetween Green's function and stochastic representative solutions of linear\ndrift-diffusion problems, provides a flexible structure within which nonlinear\nevolution problems can be analyzed and physically probed. As a preliminary test\nbed, two canonical, nonlinear evolution problems - Burgers' equation and the\nnonlinear Schrodinger's equation - are first treated. In the first case, the\nframework provides a rigorous, probabilistic derivation of the well known\nCole-Hopf ansatz. Likewise, in the second, the machinery allows systematic\nrecovery of a known soliton solution. The framework is then applied to a fairly\nextensive exploration of physical features underlying evolution of randomly\nstretched and advected Burger's vortex sheets. Here, the governing vorticity\nequation corresponds to the Fokker-Planck equation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess, a correspondence that motivates an investigation of sub-sheet\nvorticity evolution and organization. Under the assumption that weak\nhydrodynamic fluctuations organize disordered, near-molecular-scale, sub-sheet\nvorticity, it is shown that these modes consist of two weakly damped\ncounter-propagating cross-sheet acoustic modes, a diffusive cross-sheet shear\nmode, and a diffusive cross-sheet entropy mode. Once a consistent picture of\nin-sheet vorticity evolution is established, a number of analytical results,\ndescribing the motion and spread of single, multiple, and continuous sets of\nBurger's vortex sheets, evolving within deterministic and random strain rate\nfields, under both viscous and inviscid conditions, are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 15:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2010 11:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-30"}

No strong lines are detected down to 3sigma levels in 0.5 km/s\nchannels of 4.2 mK for the 1_{10}--1_{01} line and 12.6 mK for the\n1_{11}--0_{00} line. We report a very tentative detection, however, of the\n1_{10}--1_{01} line in the Wide Band Spectrometer, with a strength of\nT_{mb}=2.7 mK, a width of 5.6 km/s and an integrated intensity of 16.0 mK km/s.\nThe latter constitutes a 6sigma detection. Regardless of the reality of this\ntentative detection, model calculations indicate that our sensitive limits on\nthe line strengths preclude efficient desorption of water in the UV illuminated\nregions of the disk. We hypothesize that more than 95-99% of the water ice is\nlocked up in coagulated grains that have settled to the midplane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 15:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Fuggedaboudit! No way! When pigs fly! When\nI'm the Pope! Don't text while you're driving, however, or eat your cell phone.\n  All organisms absorb microwave radiation directly as thermal energy. In\nliving organisms, the organisms' thermal control systems, including the blood\nflow, and various cooling mechanisms, such as sweating in humans, that work to\nmaintain a stable body temperature rapidly transfer the absorbed energy to the\nenvironment. Any temperature rise is small or even unobserved. Any proposed\nmechanism by which cell phone radiation might cause cancer must begin with this\nfact. But the amount of radiation absorbed from a cell phone is less than that\nproduced by normal metabolic processes, and much less than that produced by,\nfor example, exercise. None of these normal metabolic processes cause cancer.\nTherefore, the much smaller amounts of energy from cell phones doesn't cause\ncancer either. All forms of electromagnetic energy that are known carcinogens\nare ionizing; ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Microwave radiation cannot\nionize any physiological molecule. In fact, microwave radiation cannot directly\nbreak or modify any chemical bond, covalent or weak. Therefore, microwaves\ncannot initiate any process leading to cancer, unless it does so through\nthermal mechanisms. All chemical bonds that act in physiological processes must\noperate correctly in the thermal environment of the cells at body temperature.\nAll of them have bond energy that is greater than that arising from the thermal\njostling, vibrating, and rotating of the cytoplasm. Energy added by microwave\nradiation is more than a thousand times weaker than that present in the normal\nthermal jiggling. Since the normal thermal environment does not cause cancer,\nneither does any absorbed microwave radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2010 04:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-26"}
