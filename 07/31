They do not calculate accurately the transfer of free\nmagnetic energy from the convection zone to the magnetically dominated corona\nbecause they model the effects of flux emergence using kinematic boundary\nconditions or simply assume the appearance of flux at these heights. We test\nthe importance of including dynamical flux emergence in CME modeling by\nsimulating, in 2.5D, the emergence of sub-surface flux tubes into different\ncoronal magnetic field configurations. We investigate how much free magnetic\nenergy, in the form of shear magnetic field, is transported from the convection\nzone to the corona, and whether dynamical flux emergence can drive CMEs. We\nfind that multiple coronal flux ropes can be formed during flux emergence, and\nalthough they carry some shear field into the corona, the majority of shear\nfield is confined to the lower atmosphere. Less than 10% of the magnetic energy\nin the corona is in the shear field, and this, combined with the fact that the\ncoronal flux ropes bring up significant dense material, means that they do not\nerupt. Our results have significant implications for all CME models which rely\non the transfer of free magnetic energy from the lower atmosphere into the\ncorona but which do not explicitly model this transfer. Such studies of flux\nemergence and CMEs are timely, as we have new capabilities to observe this with\nHinode and SDO, and therefore to test the models against observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 16:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2010 17:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Unfortunately, due to the prohibitively large\ndynamic range required, it is impossible to self-consistently include these\nsystems in cosmological simulations. Using fast and versatile semi-numeric\nsimulations, we systematically explore the spatial distribution of absorption\nsystems during and following reionization. We self-calibrate the resulting\nnumber of absorbers to the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing ultraviolet\nbackground (UVB), and present results at a given mfp and neutral hydrogen\nfraction. We use a simple optical depth criterion to identify the locations of\nabsorbers. Our approach is fairly robust to uncertainties such as missing\nsubgrid structure. Unlike at lower redshifts where the UVB is relatively\nuniform, at higher redshifts the fluctuations in the UVB and the HII morphology\nof reionization can drive the large-scale distribution of absorption systems.\nSpecifically, we find that absorbers are highly correlated with the density\nfield on small scales, and then become anti-correlated with the UVB on large\nscales. After reionization, the large-scale power spectrum of the absorbers\ntraces the UVB power spectrum, which can be predicted with a simple analytic\nextension of the halo-model. During reionization, absorbers tend to\npreferentially lie inside overdensities (i.e. filaments) of the\nrecently-ionized intergalactic medium (IGM). Absorbers may also dominate the\nsmall-scale (k > 1/Mpc) 21-cm power during and after reionization. Conversely,\nthey smooth the contrast on moderate scales. Once the HII regions grow to\nsurpass the mfp, the absorbers add to the large-scale 21-cm power. Our results\nshould prove useful in interpreting future observations of the reionization\nepoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2010 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, these codes are classically\nimplemented over finite fields whose size depends on some global network\nparameters (size of the network, the number of sinks) that may not be known\nprior to code design. Also, if new nodes join the entire network code may have\nto be redesigned.\n  In this work, we present the first universal and robust distributed linear\nnetwork coding schemes. Our schemes are universal since they are independent of\nall network parameters. They are robust since if nodes join or leave, the\nremaining nodes do not need to change their coding operations and the receivers\ncan still decode. They are distributed since nodes need only have topological\ninformation about the part of the network upstream of them, which can be\nnaturally streamed as part of the communication protocol.\n  We present both probabilistic and deterministic schemes that are all\nasymptotically rate-optimal in the coding block-length, and have guarantees of\ncorrectness. Our probabilistic designs are computationally efficient, with\norder-optimal complexity. Our deterministic designs guarantee zero error\ndecoding, albeit via codes with high computational complexity in general. Our\ncoding schemes are based on network codes over ``scalable fields\". Instead of\nchoosing coding coefficients from one field at every node, each node uses\nlinear coding operations over an ``effective field-size\" that depends on the\nnode's distance from the source node.

In\nparticular, the receivers in many wireless networks need to estimate the\nchannel gains by means of a training sequence. This paper studies the scaling\nlaw (on the network size) of the overhead for channel gain monitoring in\nwireless network. We first investigate the scenario in which a receiver needs\nto track the channel gains with respect to multiple transmitters. To be\nconcrete, suppose that there are n transmitters, and that in the current round\nof channel-gain estimation, no more than k channels suffer significant\nvariations since the last round. We proves that \"\\Theta(k\\log((n+1)/k)) time\nslots\" is the minimum number of time slots needed to catch up with the k varied\nchannels. At the same time, we propose a novel channel-gain monitoring scheme\nnamed ADMOT to achieve the overhead lower-bound. ADMOT leverages recent\nadvances in compressive sensing in signal processing and interference\nprocessing in wireless communication, to enable the receiver to estimate all n\nchannels in a reliable and computationally efficient manner within\nO(k\\log((n+1)/k)) time slots. To our best knowledge, all previous\nchannel-tracking schemes require \\Theta(n) time slots regardless of k.

They however entail high\ncommunication overhead for maintenance, when some of the encoded fragments are\nlost and need to be replenished. Such overheads arise from the fundamental need\nto recreate (or keep separately) first a copy of the whole object before any\nindividual encoded fragment can be generated and replenished. There has been\nrecently intense interest to explore alternatives, most prominent ones being\nregenerating codes (RGC) and hierarchical codes (HC). We propose as an\nalternative a new family of codes to improve the maintenance process, which we\ncall self-repairing codes (SRC), with the following salient features: (a)\nencoded fragments can be repaired directly from other subsets of encoded\nfragments without having to reconstruct first the original data, ensuring that\n(b) a fragment is repaired from a fixed number of encoded fragments, the number\ndepending only on how many encoded blocks are missing and independent of which\nspecific blocks are missing. These properties allow for not only low\ncommunication overhead to recreate a missing fragment, but also independent\nreconstruction of different missing fragments in parallel, possibly in\ndifferent parts of the network. We analyze the static resilience of SRCs with\nrespect to traditional erasure codes, and observe that SRCs incur marginally\nlarger storage overhead in order to achieve the aforementioned properties. The\nsalient SRC properties naturally translate to low communication overheads for\nreconstruction of lost fragments, and allow reconstruction with lower latency\nby facilitating repairs in parallel. These desirable properties make\nself-repairing codes a good and practical candidate for networked distributed\nstorage systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2010 07:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-24"}
