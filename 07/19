Significant\nadvances both in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual framework\nfor describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The experimental\ndata and theoretical methods have revealed the multifaceted character of\nproteins. Proteins exhibit universal features that can be determined using only\nthe number of amino acid residues (N) and polymer concepts. The sizes of\nproteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding\ntransition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and\ntime scales of folding are to a large extent determined by N. The consequences\nof finite N especially on how individual residues order upon folding depends on\nthe topology of the folded states. Such intricate details can be predicted\nusing the Molecular Transfer Model that combines simulations with measured\ntransfer free energies of protein building blocks from water to the desired\nconcentration of the denaturant. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using\nsingle molecule methods, the validity of the theoretically anticipated\nheterogeneity in the folding routes, and the N-dependent time scales for the\nthree stages in the approach to the native state have been established.

In recent work, we have proved lower and upper bounds on the $L^2$\ncondition numbers for these formulations, and also on the norms of the\nclassical acoustic single- and double-layer potential operators. These bounds\nto some extent make explicit the dependence of condition numbers on the wave\nnumber $k$, the geometry of the scatterer, and the coupling parameter. For\nexample, with the usual choice of coupling parameter they show that, while the\ncondition number grows like $k^{1/3}$ as $k\\to\\infty$, when the scatterer is a\ncircle or sphere, it can grow as fast as $k^{7/5}$ for a class of `trapping'\nobstacles.

In a random network with\n$\\lambda$ nodes per unit area, throughput is found to scale by a factor of\n$\\sqrt{\\log{\\lambda}}$ worse compared to the upper bound which is due to the\nuncertainty in the nodes' location. In the present model, nodes are assumed to\nknow their geographical location and to employ power control, which we\nunderstand as an additional degree of freedom to improve network performance.\nThe expected throughput-progress and the expected packet delay normalized to\nthe one-hop progress are chosen as performance metrics. These metrics are\ninvestigated for a nearest neighbor forwarding strategy, which benefits from\npower control by reducing transmission power and, hence spatial contention. It\nis shown that the connectivity-throughput trade-off can be resolved if nodes\nemploy a nearest neighbor forwarding strategy, achieving the upper bound on\nthroughput on average also in a random network while ensuring asymptotic\nconnectivity. In this case, the optimal throughput-delay scaling trade-off is\nalso achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 07:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2010 18:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2010 07:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-23"}

Another important aspect of the analysis of\nplanetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star-planet\ninteraction. Here we present a self-consistent abundance analysis of the planet\nhosting star WASP-12 and a high-precision search for a structured stellar\nmagnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained with\nthe ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter. Our results show that the star does not have a\nstructured magnetic field, and that the obtained fundamental parameters are in\ngood agreement with what was previously published. In addition we derive\nimproved constraints on the stellar age (1.0-2.65 Gyr), mass (1.23-1.49 M/M0),\nand distance (295-465 pc). WASP-12 is an ideal object to look for pollution\nsignatures in the stellar atmosphere. We analyse the WASP-12 abundances as a\nfunction of the condensation temperature and compare them with those published\nby several other authors on planet hosting and non-planet hosting stars.

The present work shows that dark\nmatter annihilation into electron-positron pairs may affect the observed\nrotation curve by a significant amount. We adopt a model-independent approach,\nwhere all the electrons and positrons are injected with the same initial energy\nE_0 ~ m_dm*c^2 in the range from 1 MeV to 1 TeV and the injection rate is\nconstrained by INTEGRAL, Fermi, and HESS data. The pressure of the relativistic\nelectron-positron gas is determined by solving the diffusion-loss equation,\nconsidering inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, Coulomb\ncollisions, bremsstrahlung, and ionization. For values of the gas density and\nmagnetic field that are representative of the Milky Way, it is estimated that\npressure gradients are strong enough to balance gravity in the central parts if\nE_0 < 1 GeV. The exact value depends somewhat on the astrophysical parameters,\nand it changes dramatically with the slope of the dark matter density profile.\nFor very steep slopes, as those expected from adiabatic contraction, the\nrotation curves of spiral galaxies would be affected on ~kpc scales for most\nvalues of E_0. By comparing the predicted rotation curves with observations of\ndwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, we show that the pressure from dark\nmatter annihilation may improve the agreement between theory and observations\nin some cases, but it also imposes severe constraints on the model parameters\n(most notably, the inner slope of halo density profile, as well as the mass and\nthe annihilation cross-section of dark matter particles into electron-positron\npairs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 15:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 16:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

These systems constitute a 25.3% increase in\nnew systems for the same region of the sky covered by previous SuperCOSMOS\nRECONS (SCR) searches that used Schmidt plates as the primary source of\ndiscovery. Among the new systems are 25 multiples, plus an additional seven new\ncommon proper motion companions found to previously known primaries. All stars\nhave been discovered using the third U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD\nAstrograph Catalog (UCAC3). A comparison of the UCAC3 proper motions to those\nfrom the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, Southern Proper Motion (SPM4), and SuperCOSMOS\nefforts is presented, and shows that UCAC3 provides similar values and\nprecision to the first three surveys. The comparison between UCAC3 and\nSuperCOSMOS indicates that proper motions in RA are systematically shifted in\nthe SuperCOSMOS data but are consistent in DEC data, while overall showing a\nsignificantly higher scatter. Distance estimates are derived for stars having\nSuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS) $B_J$, $R_{59F}$, and $I_{IVN}$ plate magnitudes\nand Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) infrared photometry. We find 15 systems\nestimated to be within 25 pc, including UPM 1710-5300 our closest new discovery\nestimated at 13.5 pc. Such new discoveries suggest that more nearby stars are\nyet to be found in these slower proper motion regimes, indicating that more\nwork is needed to develop a complete map of the solar neighborhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 15:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The sources were chosen with two criteria in mind: the existence of\nhigh quality optical and UV spectra as well as the possibility to sample the\nspectroscopic diversity in the 4D Eigenvector 1 context . In the latter sense\neach source occupies a region (bin) in the FWHM(H-beta) vs. optical FeII\nstrength plane that is significantly different from the others. High S/N H-beta\nemission line profiles are used as templates for modeling the other lines\n(Ly-alpha, CIV 1549, HeII 1640, Al III 1860, Si III] 1892, and Mg II 2800). We\ncan adequately model all broad lines assuming the existence of three components\ndistinguished by blueshifted, unshifted and redshifted centroids (indicated as\nblue, broad and very broad component respectively). The broad component (high\nelectron density, low ionization parameter; high column density) is present in\nalmost all type-1 quasars and therefore corresponds most closely to the\nclassical broad line emitting region (the reverberating component). The blue\ncomponent emission (lower electron density; high ionization; low column\ndensity) arises in less optically thick gas; it is often thought to arise in an\naccretion disk wind. The least understood component involves the very broad\ncomponent (high ionization and large column density). It is perhaps the most\ndistinguishing characteristic of quasars with FWHM H-beta > 4000 km/s that\nbelong to the so-called Population B of our 4DE1 space. Population A quasars\n(FWHM H-beta < 4000 km/s) are dominated by broad component emission in H-beta\nand blue component emission in CIV 1549 and other high ionization lines. 4DE1\nappears to be the most useful current context for revealing and unifying\nspectral diversity in type-1 quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2010 15:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}
