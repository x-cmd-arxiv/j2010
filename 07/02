The first involves the application of kurtosis and\nskewness on the vector magnitude of three component seismograms. Customarily,\nP-wave arrival detection techniques use vertical component seismogram which is\nappropriate only for teleseismic events. The inherent weakness of those methods\nstems from the fact that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal\nand vertical recording channels. Our procedure, however, uses the vector\nmagnitude which accommodates all components. The results show that this\nprocedure would be useful for detecting/picking of P-arrivals from local and\nregional earthquakes and man-made explosions. The second procedure introduces a\nnew method called \"Ratios in Higher Order Statistics (RHOS).\" Unlike commonly\nused techniques that involve derivatives, this technique employs ratios of\nadjacent kurtosis and skewness values to improve the accuracy of the detection\nof the P onset. RHOS can be applied independently on vertical component\nseismogram as well as the vector magnitude for improved detection of P-wave\narrivals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 16:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02"}

Based on the SED shape and the assumption that\nit was produced by a single star and its disk, CoKu Tau/4 was classified as a\nprototypical transitional disk, with a clean inner hole possibly carved out by\na planet, some other orbiting body, or by photodissociation. However, recently\nit has been discovered that CoKu Tau/4 is a close binary system. This implies\nthat the observed mid-IR SED is probably produced by the circumbinary disk. The\naim of the present paper is to model the SED of CoKu Tau/4 as arising from the\ninner wall of a circumbinary disk, with parameters constrained by what is known\nabout the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction between\nthese stars and their surrounding disk. In order to fit the Spitzer IRS SED,\nthe binary orbit should be almost circular, implying a small mid-IR variability\n(10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of the\ncircumbinary disk. Our models suggest that the inner wall of CoKu Tau/4 is\nlocated at 1.7a, where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8AU). A\nsmall amount of optically thin dust in the hole (<0.01 lunar masses) helps to\nimprove the fit to the 10microns silicate band. Also, we find that water ice\nshould be absent or have a very small abundance (a dust to gas mass ratio\n<5.6X10^{-5}). In general, for a binary system with eccentricity e>0, the model\npredicts mid-IR variability with periods similar to orbital timescales,\nassuming that thermal equilibrium is reached instantaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 19:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

However, it is also possible to find solids\nhaving a specific shape, like ellipses for instance, for which the problem of\ndetection admits a unique solution. Using complex analysis, we prove that the\nwell-posedness of the inverse problem is equivalent to the solvability of an\ninfinite set of nonlinear equations.

These two figures differ from each other by the constitution of the edges\nin the interior part. That is, any edges in the interior part for one figure\nare not in the interior for the other figure.

Individually, neither of these\nrepresentations possess the features to easily determine the Hamiltonicity of\nthe graph. However, the combination of these two figures, once certain weights\nare assigned to their edges, allows us to determine the Hamiltonicity with a\npolynomial-time check. The rules for the assignment of weights are: 1. The\nweight of any edge of the interior part is 0, for both objects. 2. In both\nfigures any common edge of the contour has the same weight.

For a third rapid rotator, GSC 02038-00293, intermediate\nresolution Halpha spectroscopy and low resolution spectroscopy are used for\nspectral classification and stellar parameter investigation of this poorly\nknown object. The low resolution spectrum of GSC 02038-00293 clearly indicates\nthat it is a K-type star. Its intermediate resolution spectrum can be best\nfitted with a model with Teff=4750K and vsini=90km/s, indicating a very rapidly\nrotating mid-K star.

In the case of EY Dra and V374 Peg,\nthe stellar activity in the photosphere is investigated from the photometric\nobservations, and in the chromosphere from the Halpha line. The enhanced\nchromospheric emission in EY Dra correlates well with the location of the\nphotospheric active regions, indicating that these features are spatially\ncollocated. Hints of this behaviour are also seen in V374 Peg, but it cannot be\nconfirmed from the current data. The photospheric activity patterns in EY Dra\nare stable during one observing run lasting several nights, whereas in V374 Peg\nlarge night-to-night variations are seen.

Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular\nobserved value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a\ndistribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e. the presumptive\nprior distribution . Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn\ndepends on the intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being\nstudied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it\nto several \"toy models\" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of\nM_T. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example,\neven for simple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in\nan observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the\n0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices (alpha) of the\npower-law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of\nindicies, the 95% confidence interval on M_T varies from 1.002-4.566 (alpha =\n-2) to 1.13-94.34 (alpha = +1) times larger than M_T sin(i) due to sin(i)\nuncertainty alone. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,\nboth individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)\nfactor as more than a \"numerical constant of order unity\" with simple and well\nunderstood statistical properties. We argue that reports of M_T sin(i)\ndeterminations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding\nconfidence bounds on M_T at, say, the 95% level based on an explicitly stated\nassumed form of the true M_T distribution in order to more accurately reflect\nthe mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05"}

The relay is\nassumed to operate over an orthogonal band with respect to the underlying IC,\nand the overall system is referred to as IC with an out-of-band relay (IC-OBR).\nThe system can be seen as operating over two parallel interference-limited\nchannels: The first is a standard Gaussian IC and the second is a Gaussian\nrelay channel characterized by two sources and destinations communicating\nthrough the relay without direct links. We refer to the second parallel channel\nas OBR Channel (OBRC). The main aim of this work is to identify conditions\nunder which optimal operation, in terms of the capacity region of the IC-OBR,\nentails either signal relaying and/or interference forwarding by the relay,\nwith either a separable or non-separable use of the two parallel channels, IC\nand OBRC. Here \"separable\" refers to transmission of independent information\nover the two constituent channels. For a basic model in which the OBRC consists\nof four orthogonal channels from sources to relay and from relay to\ndestinations (IC-OBR Type-I), a condition is identified under which signal\nrelaying and separable operation is optimal. When this condition is not\nsatisfied, various scenarios are identified in which interference forwarding\nand non-separable operation are necessary to achieve optimal performance. In\nthese scenarios, the system exploits the \"excess capacity\" on the OBRC via\ninterference forwarding to drive the IC-OBR system in specific interference\nregimes (strong or mixed). The analysis is then turned to a more complex\nIC-OBR, in which the OBRC consists of only two orthogonal channels, one from\nsources to relay and one from relay to destinations (IC-OBR Type-II). For this\nchannel, some capacity resuls are derived that parallel the conclusions for\nIC-OBR Type-I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

In many cases the data describes relationships that are\nprivate and sharing the data in full can result in unacceptable disclosures.\nThus, preserving privacy without revealing sensitive information in the social\nnetwork is a serious concern. Recent developments for preserving privacy using\nanonymization techniques are focused on relational data only. Preserving\nprivacy in social networks against neighborhood attacks is an initiation which\nuses the definition of privacy called k-anonymity. k-anonymous social network\nstill may leak privacy under the cases of homogeneity and background knowledge\nattacks. To overcome, we find a place to use a new practical and efficient\ndefinition of privacy called ldiversity. In this paper, we take a step further\non preserving privacy in collaborative social network data with algorithms and\nanalyze the effect on the utility of the data for social network analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 04:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}

The limitation can be circumvented by\nexploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to\ncreate synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was\ndemonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments\non rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a\nmagnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum\nrotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the\ndifficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches\nare not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics. Here,\nwe experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold\nneutral atoms, made evident from the appearance of vortices in our\nBose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially-dependent optical\ncoupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase\nsufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the\nlimitations of rotating systems; with a suitable lattice configuration, it\nshould be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling\nstudies of topological quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 05:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We advance a natural\nconjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator\n[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is\nessentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of\nthe standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a\nquestion that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature\n[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture\nimplies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This\nentails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by\nsmall quantum circuits, whose row-supports are \"nearly-disjoint.\" (2) We give a\nsimple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any\nefficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can\nbe distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum\nalgorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a\nproblem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired\noracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson's \"GLN conjecture\" [A10] implies our\nconjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture\nwas recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open\nfor depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an\noracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open\nproblem. Taken together, our results have the following interesting\ninterpretation: they give an instantiation of the Nisan-Wigderson generator\nthat can be broken by quantum computers, but not by the relevant modes of\nclassical computation, if our conjecture is true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 06:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2010 00:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

The positions at which objects are usually lost and found are\nclustered in order to construct the set of 'lost zones' and 'found zones' in\nthe scene. Using these zones, we construct a triplet set of zones i.e. three\nzones: In/Out zone (zone where an object can enter or exit the scene), 'lost\nzone' and 'found zone'. Thanks to these triplets, during the testing phase, we\ncan repair the erroneous trajectories according to which triplet they are most\nlikely to belong to. The advantage of our approach over the existing state of\nthe art approaches is that (i) this method does not depend on a predefined\ncontextual scene, (ii) we exploit the semantic of the scene and (iii) we have\nproposed a method to filter out noisy trajectories based on their confidence\nvalue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 07:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-21"}

Effects on performance and resource consumption\nwere measured in experiments, which were carried out in a local area test-bed.\nThe experiments were conducted with components of one specific distributed\nstorage system, but seek to be applicable to a wide range of such systems, in\nparticular those exposed to varying conditions. The perceived characteristics\nof distributed storage systems depend on their configuration parameters and on\nvarious dynamic conditions. For a given set of conditions, one specific\nconfiguration may be better than another with respect to measures such as\nresource consumption and performance. Here, configuration parameter values were\nset dynamically and the results compared with a static configuration. It was\nhypothesised that under non-changing conditions this would allow the system to\nconverge on a configuration that was more suitable than any that could be set a\npriori. Furthermore, the system could react to a change in conditions by\nadopting a more appropriate configuration. Autonomic management was applied to\nthe peer-to-peer (P2P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed\nstorage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload\nand churn patterns. The management policies and mechanisms were implemented\nusing a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work.

We utilize the Hubble Space Telescope observations for\ndifferent elevation angles B to disentangle these contributions. We assume that\nthe intrinsic contribution is independent of B, so that any B dependence of the\nphase curves is due to interparticle shadowing, which must also act similarly\nfor all colors. We construct a grid of dynamical/photometric simulation models\nto fit the elevation-dependent part of opposition brightening. Eliminating the\nmodeled interparticle component yields the intrinsic contribution to the\nopposition effect: for the B and A rings it is almost entirely due to coherent\nbackscattering; for the C ring, an intraparticle shadow hiding contribution may\nalso be present.\n  Based on our simulations, the width of the interparticle shadowing effect is\nroughly proportional to B. This follows from the observation that as B\ndecreases, the scattering is primarily from the rarefied low filling factor\nupper ring layers, whereas at larger $B$'s the dense inner parts are visible.\nThe elevation angle dependence of interparticle shadowing also explains most of\nthe B ring tilt effect (the increase of brightness with elevation). From\ncomparison of the magnitude of the tilt effect at different filters, we show\nthat multiple scattering can account for at most a 10% brightness increase as B\n-> 26^o, whereas the remaining 20% brightening is due to a variable degree of\ninterparticle shadowing. The negative tilt effect of the middle A ring is well\nexplained by the the same self-gravity wake models that account for the\nobserved A ring azimuthal brightness asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 12:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Nevertheless, their IR Spectral Energy Distributions are split\nbetween AGN (Mrk231) and star-forming templates (Arp220). Our primary goal is\nto examine their individual X-ray spectra in order to assess whether this X-ray\ndetected DOG population contains heavily obscured or even Compton-thick\nsources. The X-ray spectroscopy reveals a mixed bag of objects. We find that\nfour out of the 12 sources with adequate photon statistics and hence reliable\nX-ray spectra, show evidence for a hard X-ray spectral index (~1) or\nharder,consistent with a Compton-thick spectrum. In total 12 out of the 26 DOGs\nshow evidence for flat spectral indices. However, owing to the limited photon\nstatistics we cannot differentiate whether these are flat because they are\nreflection-dominated or because they show moderate amounts of absorption. Seven\nDOGs show relatively steep spectra (>1.4) indicative of small column densities.\nAll the above suggest a fraction of Compton-thick sources that does not exceed\n5%.

There is large pressure on the scientific community to deliver\ndedicated accelerators, providing the best possible treatment modalities at the\nlowest cost. In this context, the Italian research Foundation TERA is\ndeveloping fast-cycling accelerators, dubbed 'cyclinacs'. These are a\ncombination of a cyclotron (accelerating ions to a fixed initial energy)\nfollowed by a high gradient linac boosting the ions energy up to the maximum\nneeded for medical therapy. The linac is powered by many independently\ncontrolled klystrons to vary the beam energy from one pulse to the next. This\naccelerator is best suited to treat moving organs with a 4D multi-painting spot\nscanning technique. A dual proton/carbon ion cyclinac is here presented. It\nconsists of an Electron Beam Ion Source, a superconducting isochronous\ncyclotron and a high-gradient linac. All these machines are pulsed at high\nrepetition rate (100-400 Hz). The source should deliver both C6+ and H2+ ions\nin short pulses (1.5 {\\mu}s flat-top) and with sufficient intensity (at least\n108 fully stripped carbon ions at 300 Hz). The cyclotron accelerates the ions\nto 120 MeV/u. It features a compact design (with superconducting coils) and a\nlow power consumption. The linac has a novel C-band high gradient structure and\naccelerates the ions to variable energies up to 400 MeV/u. High RF frequencies\nlead to power consumptions which are much lower than the ones of synchrotrons\nfor the same ion extraction energy.

The derandomized\nversions produce again significantly better rounding errors, with running times\nstill negligible compared to the one for solving the corresponding LP. It thus\nseems worth preferring them over the randomized variants.\n  The data created in these experiments lets us propose and investigate the\nfollowing new ideas. For the low-congestion routing problems, we suggest to\nsolve a second LP, which yields the same congestion, but aims at producing a\nsolution that is easier to round. Experiments show that this reduces the\nrounding errors considerably, both in combination with randomized and\nderandomized rounding.\n  For the max-coverage instances, we generally observe that the greedy\nheuristics also performs very good. We develop a strengthened method of\nderandomized rounding, and a simple greedy/rounding hybrid approach using\ngreedy and LP-based rounding elements, and observe that both these improvements\nyield again better solutions than both earlier approaches on their own.\n  For unit disk max-domination, we also develop a PTAS. Contrary to all other\nalgorithms investigated, it performs not much better in experiments than in\ntheory; thus, unless extremely good solutions are to be obtained with huge\ncomputational resources, greedy, LP-based rounding or hybrid approaches are\npreferable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 14:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05"}
