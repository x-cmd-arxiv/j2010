Here\nwe describe how the rejection-free geometrical cluster algorithm (GCA) of Liu\nand Luijten [Phys. Rev. Lett 92, 035504 (2004)] can be embedded within a\nrestricted Gibbs ensemble to facilitate efficient and accurate studies of fluid\nphase behavior of highly size-asymmetrical mixtures. After providing a detailed\ndescription of the algorithm, we summarize the bespoke analysis techniques of\nAshton et al. [J. Chem.

We apply our\nmethods to study the liquid--vapor phase diagram of a particular mixture of\nLennard-Jones particles having a 10:1 size ratio. As the reservoir volume\nfraction of small particles is increased in the range 0--5%, the critical\ntemperature decreases by approximately 50%, while the critical density drops by\nsome 30%. These trends imply that in our system, adding small particles\ndecreases the net attraction between large particles, a situation that\ncontrasts with hard-sphere mixtures where an attractive depletion force occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 16:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-14"}

We solve this problem for generic\nconnected network topologies with asymmetric random link failures with a novel\ndistributed, decentralized algorithm.

We interpret a well-studied abstraction of\nnanomolecular self assembly, the Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), into\nComputation Tree Logic (CTL), a temporal logic often used in model checking. We\nthen consider the class of \"rectilinear\" tile assembly systems. This class\nincludes most aTAM systems studied in the theoretical literature, and all\n(algorithmic) DNA tile self-assembling systems that have been realized in\nlaboratories to date. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a tile\nassembly system T as input, either provides a counterexample to T's\nrectilinearity or verifies whether T has a unique terminal assembly. Using\npartial order reductions, the verification search space for this algorithm is\nreduced from exponential size to O(n^2), where n x n is the size of the\nassembly surface. That reduction is asymptotically the best possible. We report\non experimental results obtained by translating tile assembly simulator files\ninto a Petri net format manipulable by the SMART model checking engines devised\nby Ciardo et al.

In both the normal and superconducting (SC)\nstates, the spectrum lacks the 42/m screw symmetry around the (1/2 1/2 L) axis\nthat is implied by the I4/mmm space group. This is manifest both in the\nin-plane anisotropy of the normal- and SC-state spin dynamics and in the\nout-of-plane dispersion of the spin-resonance mode. We show that this effect\noriginates from the higher symmetry of the magnetic Fe sublattice with respect\nto the crystal itself, hence the INS signal inherits the symmetry of the\nunfolded Brillouin zone (BZ) of the Fe sublattice. The in-plane anisotropy is\ntemperature-independent and can be qualitatively reproduced in normal-state\ndensity-functional-theory calculations without invoking a symmetry-broken\n(\"nematic\") ground state that was previously proposed as an explanation for\nthis effect. Below the SC transition, the energy of the magnetic resonant mode\nEr, as well as its intensity and the SC spin gap inherit the normal-state\nintensity modulation along the out-of-plane direction L with a period twice\nlarger than expected from the body-centered-tetragonal BZ symmetry. The\namplitude of this modulation decreases at higher doping, providing an analogy\nto the splitting between even and odd resonant modes in bilayer cuprates.\nCombining our and previous data, we show that at odd L a universal linear\nrelationship Er=4.3*kB*Tc holds for all studied Fe-based superconductors,\nindependent of their carrier type. Its validity down to the lowest doping\nlevels is consistent with weaker electron correlations in ferropnictides as\ncompared to the underdoped cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2010 19:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2010 19:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 15:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-04"}

Moreover, z=0 gas fractions are low enough that while they\nhave some effect on the magnitude of outflows required, the slope of the gas\nfraction--stellar mass relation does not strongly affect our conclusions on how\nthe wind efficiencies must scale with galaxy mass. Despite systematic\nuncertainties in the normalization and slope of the mass-metallicity relation,\nwe show that the metal expulsion efficiency zetaw=(Zw/Zg)etaw (where Zw is the\nwind metallicitiy and Zg is the interstellar medium metallicity) must be both\nhigh and scale steeply with mass. Specifically, we show that zetaw >> 1 and\nzetaw proportional to vvir^-3 or steeper. In contrast, momentum- or\nenergy-driven outflow models suggest that etaw should scale as vvir^-1 or\nvvir^-2, respectively, implying that the Zw-Mstar relation should be shallower\nthan the Zg-Mstar relation.

However, its exact non-Markovian finite-temperature two-time\nsystem operator CF's, to our knowledge, have not been presented in the\nliterature.

The two-time CF's obtained using the recently derived evolution\nequations in the weak system-environment coupling case for this non-Markovian\npure-dephasing model happen to be the same as those obtained from the exact\nevaluation.

The domain formation is\nlikely caused by a length difference of the receptor-ligand complexes, and has\nbeen investigated in experiments in which T cells adhere to supported membranes\nwith anchored ligands. For supported membranes with two types of anchored\nligands, MHCp and ICAM1, that bind to the receptors TCR and LFA1 in the cell\nmembrane, the coexistence of domains of TCR-MHCp and LFA1-ICAM1 complexes in\nthe cell adhesion zone has been observed for a wide range of ligand\nconcentrations and affinities.

It is observed that the in phase part\ngoes through a maximum that is removed on the application of moderate dc field.\nDC fields suppress both the components with the strongest effects being at or\nclose to Tc. Conduction and ferromagnetism has been consistently suppressed by\nFe doping. Increased spin disorder and decrease of Tc with increasing Fe\ncontent are evident. The variations in the critical temperature Tc and magnetic\nmoment show a rapid change at about 4-5% Fe. The effect of Fe is seen to be\nconsistent with the disruption of the Mn-Mn exchange possibly due to the\nformation of magnetic clusters. There is clear correlation between the\nstructures in the resistivity and the in and out of phase parts of the\nsusceptibility. With increasing Fe concentration the out of phase part (x'')\npeak shift to T<T1/2, but it stays consistently at the temperature where the\nresistivity changes slow down.

This super-matrix model is\nclosely related to a matrix model describing topological Chern-Simons theory on\na lens space. We explore further these recent observations and extract more\nexact results in ABJM theory from the matrix model. In particular we calculate\nthe planar free energy, which matches at strong coupling the classical IIA\nsupergravity action on AdS_4 x CP^3 and gives the correct N^{3/2} scaling for\nthe number of degrees of freedom of the M2 brane theory. Furthermore we find\ncontributions coming from world-sheet instanton corrections in CP^3. We also\ncalculate non-planar corrections, both to the free energy and to the Wilson\nloop expectation values. This matrix model appears also in the study of\ntopological strings on a toric Calabi-Yau manifold, and an intriguing\nconnection arises between the space of couplings of the planar ABJM theory and\nthe moduli space of this Calabi-Yau. In particular it suggests that, in\naddition to the usual perturbative and strong coupling (AdS) expansions, a\nthird natural expansion locus is the line where one of the two 't Hooft\ncouplings vanishes and the other is finite.

Detailed line dynamics also confirm a\nprevious suggestion that the observed photo-ionized line emission originates\nfrom a confined region in the outer edge of the accretion disk near the hot\nspot. Line properties allow us to impose limits on the size of accretion disk,\nthe central corona, and the emission region. The photo-ionized plasma is\nconsistent with ionization parameters of log(xi) > 2, and when combined with\ndisk size and reasonable assumptions for the plasma density, this suggests\nilluminating disk luminosities which are over an order of magnitude higher than\nwhat is actually observed.

We confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample\n(M_B<=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (U-B>=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on delta\nat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. This\ntrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of the\nfraction of galaxies with D4000A break >=1.4. We also find that up to z=1 the\nfraction of galaxies with log(EW[OII]) >=1.15 is higher for lower delta, and\nalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. Given the triple dependence\namong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation found\nin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellar\nmasses. Thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case the\ncolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(M/M_sun)>=10.7.\nThis means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in a\nluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass and\nmass-delta relations. In contrast, we find that for 0.1<=z<=0.5 and\nlog(M/M_sun)<=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. In these mass\nand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. We suggest a\nscenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but for\nrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. These\ngalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were already\nin place, and their longer SFH allowed environment-driven physical processes to\noperate during longer periods of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 09:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We study the formation of such BHs, as well as the accretion of\ngas onto these objects and the high energy radiation emitted in the accretion\nprocess, by carrying out cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations. In\nthe absence of radiative feedback, we find an upper limit to the accretion rate\nonto the central object which forms from the initial collapse of hot (~ 10^4 K)\ngas of the order of 0.1 MSun per year. This is high enough for the formation of\na supermassive star, the immediate precursor of a BH, with a mass of the order\nof 10^5 MSun. Assuming that a fraction of this mass goes into a BH, we track\nthe subsequent accretion of gas onto the BH self-consistently with the high\nenergy radiation emitted from the accretion disk.

We\nfind that BHs with masses of the order of 10^4 MSun initially accrete at close\nto the Eddington limit, but that the accretion rate drops to of order 1 percent\nof the Eddington limit after ~ 10^6 yr, due to the expansion of the gas near\nthe BH in response to strong photoheating and radiation pressure.

The relative pink noise amplitude is almost\nindependent of concentration and pH for KCl solutions, but varies strongly\nusing ionic liquids. In particular we show that depending on the ionic liquid,\nthe transport of charge carriers is strongly facilitated (low noise and higher\nconductivity than in the bulk) or jammed.

This dynamics consists of a steady state orbit around the nanocontact,\nwhich is made possible because the intrinsic magnetic damping is compensated by\nspin torques. In this article, we present an analytical theory of the power\nspectrum of these oscillations based on a rigid-vortex model. The appearance of\nvortex oscillations in nanocontacts is not associated with a Hopf bifurcation:\nthere is no critical current and the only precondition for steady-state\noscillations at finite currents is the existence of a vortex in the system, in\ncontrast with conventional spin-torque oscillators that involve large-angle\nmagnetization precession. The oscillation frequency is found to depend linearly\non the applied current and inversely proportional to the orbital radius. By\nsolving the associated Langevin problem for the vortex dynamics, the lineshape\nand linewidth for the power spectrum are also obtained. Under typical\nexperimental conditions, a Lorentzian lineshape with a current-independent\nlinewidth is predicted. Good quantitative agreement between the theory and\nrecent experiments is shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2010 11:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-23"}

A variety of\ntheoretical probes are used to determine the quantum phase transition,\nincluding energy gap crossing, a finite size scaling analysis, bond order\nauto-correlation functions, and bipartite quantum entanglement. All these\nprobes indicate that in the antiadiabatic phonon limit a quantum phase\ntransition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is observed at a\nnon-zero spin-phonon coupling, $g_{\\text c}$. An extrapolation from the\nEinstein limit to the Debye limit is accompanied by an increase in $g_{\\text\nc}$ for a fixed optical ($q=\\pi $) phonon gap.

We find that a close-in Jupiter-like planet orbiting at 0.05AU\npresents a radio power that is ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the one\nobserved in Jupiter, which suggests that the stellar wind from a young star has\nthe potential to generate strong planetary radio emission that could be\ndetected in the near future with LOFAR.
