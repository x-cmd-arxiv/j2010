From a practical viewpoint, it is beneficial to\napproximately solve those CSPs. When one tries to approximate the total number\nof truth assignments that satisfy all Boolean-valued constraints for\n(unweighted) Boolean CSPs, there is a known trichotomy theorem by which all\nsuch counting problems are neatly classified into exactly three categories\nunder polynomial-time (randomized) approximation-preserving reductions. In\ncontrast, we obtain a dichotomy theorem of approximate counting for\ncomplex-weighted Boolean CSPs, provided that all complex-valued unary\nconstraints are freely available to use. It is the expressive power of free\nunary constraints that enables us to prove such a stronger, complete\nclassification theorem. This discovery makes a step forward in the quest for\nthe approximation-complexity classification of all counting CSPs. To deal with\ncomplex weights, we employ proof techniques of factorization and arity\nreduction along the line of solving Holant problems. Moreover, we introduce a\nnovel notion of T-constructibility that naturally induces\napproximation-preserving reducibility. Our result also gives an approximation\nanalogue of the dichotomy theorem on the complexity of exact counting for\ncomplex-weighted Boolean CSPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 16:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2011 10:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 08:37:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 16:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-17"}

In addition, we\ninclude the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and\nevaluate companion information from various catalogs.\n  The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher order\nsystems are 56% \\pm 2%, 33% \\pm 2%, 8% \\pm 1%, and 3% \\pm 1%, respectively,\ncounting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. Our completeness\nanalysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this\nwell-studied sample, implying that the majority (54% \\pm 2%) of solar-type\nstars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. The\norbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log-normal\nwith a peak of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows a\nroughly flat distribution beyond the expected circularization for periods below\n12 days. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs,\nwhich occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet\nhosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically\nindistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single\nstars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with\nsufficiently wide separations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 17:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Plutinos are those trans-Neptunian objects\nlocated at 39.5 AU, in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune. To do this,\nwe develop a statistical code that includes catastrophic collisions and\ncratering events, and takes into account the stability and instability zones of\nthe 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune. We proposes different initial\npopulations that account for the uncertainty in the size distribution of\nPlutinos at small sizes. Depending on the initial population, our results\nindicate the following. The number of D > 1 km Plutinos streaking Pluto over\n3.5 Gyr is between 1271 and 5552. For Charon, the number of D > 1 km Plutino\nimpactors is between 354 and 1545. The number of D > 1 km craters on Pluto\nproduced by Plutinos during the last 3.5 Gyr is between 43076 and 113879. For\nCharon, the number of D > 1 km craters is between 20351 and 50688.The largest\nPlutino impactor onto Pluto has a diameter between 17 and 23 km, which produces\na craterwith a diameter of 31 - 39 km. The largest Plutino impactor onto Charon\nhas a diameter between 10 and 15 km, which produces a crater with a diameter of\n24 - 33 km. We test if 2 Pluto-sized objects are assumed in the 3:2 Neptune\nresonance, then the total number of Plutino impactors both onto Pluto as Charon\nwith diameters D > 1 km is a factor of 1.6 - 1.8 larger if considering 1\nPluto-sized object. Given the dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian\nregion, it is necessary to study in detail the contribution of all the\npotential sources of impactors on the Pluto-Charon system, to obtain the main\ncontributor and the whole production of craters. Then, we will be able to\ncontrast those studies with observations which will help us to understand the\ngeological processes and history of the surface of those worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 17:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A numerical analysis is presented and\nit is shown that the top EDM could be close to $10^{-19} ecm$ consistent with\nthe current limits on the EDM of the electron, the neutron and on atomic EDMs.\nA top EDM of size $10^{-19}ecm$ could be accessible in collider experiments\nsuch as the ILC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 19:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2010 17:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

The initial conditions are either an X-point configuration\nembedded in 3D, the so-called Orszag-Tang vortex, or an\nArn'old-Beltrami-Childress configuration with a fully helical velocity and\nmagnetic field. In each case two snapshots are analyzed, separated by one\nturn-over time, starting just after the peak of dissipation. We show that the\nalgorithm is able to select a large number of structures (in excess of 8,000)\nfor each snapshot and that the statistical properties of these clusters are\nremarkably similar for the two snapshots as well as for the two flows under\nstudy in terms of scaling laws for the cluster characteristics, with the\nstructures in the vorticity and in the current behaving in the same way.

The observations presented here provide a crucial test of the\nscattering scenario and lead us to disfavor it because (a) the polarization\nlevel is very small (p~0.6%) throughout the spectrum, and (b) the polarization\nlevel does not increase across the mini-BAL trough. Thus, the variable screen\nscenario emerges as our favored explanation of the C IV mini-BAL variability.\nOur conclusion is bolstered by recent X-ray observations of nearby mini-BAL\nquasars, which show a rapidly variable soft X-ray continuum that appears to be\nthe result of transmission through an ionized absorber of variable ionization\nparameter and optical depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 21:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The natural setting is provided by doing\ngeometry with the complex numbers C replaced by the double numbers D, where i\nwith i^2 = -1 is replaced by tau with tau^2 = 1. A rather surprising amount of\ncomplex geometry carries over, almost untouched, and this has been the subject\nof many papers. We briefly review this material and, in particular, we discuss\nHermitian D-manifolds with trivial canonical bundle, which provide the\nbackground space for the geometry of split SLAG submanifolds.\n  A removable singularities result is proved for split SLAG subvarieties. It\nimplies, in particular, that there exist no split SLAG cones, smooth outside\nthe origin, other than planes. This is in sharp contrast to the complex case.\n  Parallel to the complex case, space-like Lagrangian submanifolds are\nstationary if and only if they are theta-split SLAG for some phase angle theta,\nand infinitesimal deformations of split SLAG submanifolds are characterized by\nharmonic 1-forms on the submanifold.\n  We also briefly review the recent work of Kim, McCann and Warren who have\nshown that split Special Lagrangian geometry is directly related to the\nMonge-Kantorovich mass transport problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 21:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the\nenergy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy\nexchange between molecules during collisions. However, while in physical\nsystems the equipartition of energy is valid, in most exchange models for\neconomic markets the system converges to a very unequal \"condensed\" state,\nwhere one or a few agents concentrate all the wealth of the society and the\nwide majority of agents shares zero or a very tiny fraction of the wealth. Here\nwe present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation\nbut also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of\ninteracting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated\nby the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is\nchanged at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of\nthis poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory\ntool for wealth redistribution.

We find that our model\ndisplays a strong tendency to expand toward the pole. We demonstrate that this\nexpansion is a physical property of the low-mode, SASI instability. The SASI\nleaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which\naffects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate\ndeformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from\nmoderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be\nresponsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The\nsimulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the\npost-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the\nearly explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after\nshock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant\nprolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week\nafter the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta\nmorphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.\nSystematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced\nlate-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to\nwhich extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations. The\nimpact on and importance of the SASI for the distribution of iron group nuclei\nand the morphology of the young SNR argues for future three-dimensional\nexplosion and post-explosion studies on singularity-free grids that cover the\nentire sphere. Given the results of our 2D resolution study, present 3D\nsimulations must be regarded as underresolved, and their conclusions must be\nverified by a proper numerical convergence analysis in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 00:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

He is mainly celebrated as the first\npersons to define correctly net yield and describe method for its optimization,\nwhich was considered \"strikingly modern\" still in 1950. Buquoy's program was\n\"systematic overview of all theorems which affect maintenance and increase of\nnational wealth\" for which he correctly defined and mathematically expressed\nmany economic terms. The most striking feature of Buquoy's writing is that he\nwas also a very influential economic practitioner. He governed one of the\nwealthiest possessions in Bohemia, and perhaps in Austria, of his time. Thus\nhis economical thinking expands from the \"political part\", which is economy in\nmodern sense, to \"...sources of national wealth, or the technical part of\nnational economy ...\". The complexity of Buquoy's view has little match in\nmodern literature namely because the extent of data sources is hardly available\nin modern times. The article puts Buquoy's mathematical economy contributions\nin context to his mathematical physics thoughts and approaches. The last direct\ncitation of Buquoy's work comes from the year 2008.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 06:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06"}

Appreciating significance of the challenging problem of the\nclassical turbulence it can be expressed that the idea to study it in terms of\nquantized line is indeed very important and may be regarded as a breakthrough.\nFor this reason, this theory should be carefully scrutinized. One of the basic\narguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays\nat zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual\nfriction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the\nvortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it\nis natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow\nof the energy, just as in the classical turbulence. In a series of recent\nexperiment attenuation of vortex line density was observed and authors\nattribute this decay to the properties of the Kolmogorov turbulence. In the\npresent work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,\nwhich is not related to dissipation at small scales. This mechanism is just the\ndiffusive like spreading of the vortex tangle. We discuss a number of the key\nexperiments, considering them both from the point of view of alternative\nexplanation and of the theory of Kolmogorov turbulence in quantum fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 08:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06"}

It turns out\nthat the mathematical problem underpinning both quantities is the computation\nof certain Hankel determinants generated by deformed versions of classical\nweight functions. For single-user MIMO systems, it is a deformed Laguerre\nweight, whereas for multi-user MIMO systems it is a deformed Jacobi weight. We\napply two different methods to characterize each of these Hankel determinants.\nFirst, we employ the ladder operators of the corresponding monic orthogonal\npolynomials to give an exact characterization of the Hankel determinants in\nterms of Painlev\\'{e} differential equations. This turns out to be a\nPainlev\\'{e} V for the single-user MIMO scenario and a Painlev\\'{e} VI for the\nmulti user scenario. We then employ Coulomb fluid methods to derive new\nclosed-form approximations for the Hankel determinants which, although formally\nvalid for large matrix dimensions, are shown to give accurate results for both\nthe MIMO mutual information distribution and the error exponent even when the\nmatrix dimensions are small. Focusing on the single-user mutual information\ndistribution, we then employ both the exact Painlev\\'{e} representation and the\nCoulomb fluid approximation to yield deeper insights into the scaling behavior\nin terms of the number of antennas and signal-to-noise ratio. Among other\nthings, these results allow us to study the asymptotic Gaussianity of the\ndistribution as the number of antennas increase, and to explicitly compute the\ncorrection terms to the mean, variance, and higher order cumulants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 13:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06"}

Such information can be used to improve estimation\nand inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular\nmechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an\nimportant problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time\nprovides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are\naffected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore\nbe used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating\nlasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression\ndata. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying\ntime series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators.\nMoreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between\nactivation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We\nprovide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show\nthat the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the\nlarge $p$, small $n$ setting. The performance of the proposed model is\nevaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples.
